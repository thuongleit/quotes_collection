 - If you want to be told what to think, well, I’m not in that business.
 - The only thing simple about the past is that it’s not now.
 - A great painting is a great painting.
 - There are people who don’t respond to color. That’s what painting is. It’s color.
 - If you think you know where you’re going to be 10 years from now, that’s where you’re at now. You’re just putting it off.
