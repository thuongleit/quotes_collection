 - Preach the gospel, die and be forgotten.
 - I have one passion. It is He, only He.
 - I am destined to proclaim the message, unmindful of personal consequences to myself.
 - I am, as ever, a poor sinner, a captive of eternal love, running by the side of His triumphal chariot, and I have no desire to be anything else as long as I live.
 - I have but one passion â€“ it is He, it is He alone. The world is the field and the field is the world; and henceforth that country shall be my home where I can be most used in winning souls for Christ.
 - Only atheists attempt to comprehend god with their mind.
