 - Empathy isn’t just listening, it’s asking the questions whose answers need to be listened to. Empathy requires inquiry as much as imagination. Empathy requires knowing you know nothing. Empathy means acknowledging a horizon of context that extends perpetually beyond what you can see.
 - Empathy requires knowing that you know nothing.
 - No trauma has discrete edges. Trauma bleeds. Out of wounds and across boundaries.
 - Empathy isn’t just something that happens to us – a meteor shower of synapses firing across the brain – it’s also a choice we make: to pay attention, to extend ourselves.
 - Whenever I’ve been stuck on a project, it’s always brought me solace to the return to books that moved me in the past. It’s a nice way to get outside my own head; and it brings me back to one of the most important reasons I write at all: to bring some pleasure to readers, to make them think or feel.
 - Armchair poverty tourism has been around as long as authors have written about class. As an author, I have struggled myself with the nuances of writing about poverty without reducing any community to a catalog of its difficulties.
 - The publishing industry, unsurprisingly, is full of different people who love different things and express that love in different languages. Find the people, the editors and agents, with whom you share some language, and some sense of what makes literature worth reading.
 - In my own life as a reader I experience real moments of alienation when a writer feels too perfect, or like even the flaws they are admitting are somehow noble, or dysfunctional in an overly edgy, aesthetically pleasing way.
 - I like thinking of the writer as a kind of curator; the collection as curiosity cabinet – in a non-demeaning, non-objectifying sense – but an array, a set of offerings.
 - Though there might not be any easy answers to the problem of poverty, its most compelling scribes do not resign themselves to representation solely for the sake of those age-old verities of truth and beauty.
 - We think we should have to work in order to feel. We want to have our cake resist us; and then we want to eat it, too.
 - When bad things happened to other people, I imagined them happening to me. I didn’t know if this was empathy or theft.
 - Perhaps if we say it straight, we suspect, if we express our sentiments too excessively or too directly, we’ll find we’re nothing but banal.
 - Commonality doesn’t inoculate against hurt.
 - Whatever we can’t hold, we hang on a hook that will hold it.
 - I’ve been lucky enough to work with extraordinary teachers along the way, and I’m excited to share what I’ve learned with graduate students at SNHU. I’m just as excited for what I’ll learn from them.
 - Imagining someone else’s pain with too much surety can be as damaging as failing to imagine it.
 - It’s one of the most liberating things I experience in writing – letting yourself get rid of a gesture or character or plot point that always nagged, even if you couldn’t admit to yourself that it did.
 - The pain is what you make of it. You have to find something in it that yields. I understood my guiding imperative as: keep bleeding, but find some love in the blood.
 - I loved the full heat of being drunk, like I was made of melting chocolate and spreading in all directions.
 - When people ask what kind of nonfiction I write, I say ‘all kinds,’ but really I mean I don’t write any kind at all: I’m trying to dissolve the borders between memoir and journalism and criticism by weaving them together.
 - Learning the edges or limits or sources of friction in empathy was one of the big issues for me.
 - I needed people to deliver my feelings back to me in a form that was legible. Which is a superlative kind of empathy to seek, or to supply: an empathy that rearticulates more clearly what it’s shown.
 - Empathy is cloaked in our actions – as in, we might be experiencing empathy but not realize it’s empathy.
 - I think of empathy as a set of cumulative effects, ideally – that it can be a force shaping your habits, shaping where you put your attention and then – if you’re hard on yourself, in good ways – pushing you to translate that attention into action, on whatever scale.
