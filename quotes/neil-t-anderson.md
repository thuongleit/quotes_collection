 - The major strategy of Satan is to distort the character of God and the truth of who we are. He can’t change God and he can’t do anything to change our identity and position in Christ. If, however, he can get us to believe a lie, we will live as though our identity in Christ isn’t true.
 - The more you reaffirm who you are in Christ, the more your behavior will begin to reflect your true identity.
 - Being filled and led by the Spirit may take you places you never planned; but the will of God will never lead you where the grace of God cannot keep you.

 - A Christian is not simply a person who is forgiven and goes to heaven. A Christian, in terms of his or her deepest identity, is a saint, a spiritually born child of God, a divine masterpiece, a child of light, a citizen of heaven.
 - When you resort to shouting in conflict, you are reacting in the flesh. You have lost control of the only person you can control: yourself.
