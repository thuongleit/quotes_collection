 - There is one common struggle against those who have appropriated the earth, the money, and the machines.
 - I die, as I have lived, a free spirit, an Anarchist, owing no allegiance to rulers, heavenly or earthly.
 - Anarchism, to me, means not only the denial of authority, not only a new economy, but a revision of the principles of morality. It means the development of the individual as well as the assertion of the individual. It means self-responsibility, and not leader worship.
 - Make no laws whatever concerning speech, and speech will be free; so soon as you make a declaration on paper that speech shall be free, you will have a hundred lawyers proving that “freedom does not mean abuse, nor liberty license,” and they will define freedom out of existence.
 - What I say is, that the real non-resistants can believe in direct action only, never in political action. For the basis of all political action is coercion; even when the State does good things, it finally rests on a club, a gun, or a prison, for its power to carry them through.
 - I never expect men to give us liberty. No, women, we are not worth it until we take it.
 - Government is as unreal, as intangible, as unapproachable as God. Try it, if you don’t believe it. Seek through the legislative halls of America and find, if you can, the Government. In the end you will be doomed to confer with the agent, as before.
 - As to the American tradition of non-meddling, Anarchism asks that it be carried down to the individual himself.
 - The question of souls is old – we demand our bodies, now. We are tired of promises, god is deaf, and his church is our worst enemy.
 - There is no peace now, and there will never be peace, so long as one rules over another.
 - No one can hate petitions worse than I, and no one has less faith in them than I. But for my champion I am willing to try any means that invades no other’s right, even though I have little hope in it.
 - A right, in the abstract, is a fact ; it is not a thing to be given, established, or conferred; it is. Of the exercise of a right power may deprive me; of the right itself, never.
 - I think it can be shown that the law makes ten criminals where it restrains one.
 - The paramount question of the day is not political, is not religious, but is economic. The crying-out demand of today is for a circle of principles that shall forever make it impossible for one man to control another by controlling the means of his existence.
 - A man won’t steal, ordinarily, unless that which he steals is something he cannot as easily get without stealing; in liberty the cost of stealing would involve greater difficulties than producing, and consequently he would not be apt to steal.
 - As long as the working-people fold hands and pray the gods in Washington to give them work, so long they will not get it.
 - A standing army is a standing menace to liberty.
 - Private enterprise manages better all that to which it is equal. Anarchism declares that private enterprise, whether individual or cooperative, is equal to all the undertakings of society.
 - There is no society for the prevention of cruelty to women.
