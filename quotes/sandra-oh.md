 - All the jobs I’ve gotten in the last two years are because directors have seen the work I’ve done – indie films, plays, short student films, TV – since I moved to the states in 1996. I mean, I have an entire career in Canada that nobody has seen.
 - With small breasts, you don’t have to wear a bra with dresses that have some support. It feels sexy without one.
 - I love my hair. When I was young it had weird kinks and cowlicks in it, but I just grew into it. You grow into a lot of things.
 - I don’t get jobs in films by auditioning. I’m not blonde. You can’t place me in movies the way you can with certain actors. It’s very difficult for my agents.
 - I grew up never seeing myself on-screen, and it’s really important to me to give people who look like me a chance to see themselves. I want to see myself as the hero of any story. I want to see myself save the world from the bomb.
