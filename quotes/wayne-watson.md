 - For such a time as this I was placed upon the earth. To hear the voice of God and do His will, whatever it is.
 - I’d rather walk in the dark with Jesus than to dance in the light on my own.
 - I don’t want to read more into it than there is. I try not to overanalyze anymore, as it tends to make me self-centered. If there is a deeper message in what happened in the last year and a half, I’m not going to look under every rock for it. Just let God be God.
 - Jesus, he meets you where you are. Jesus, he heals your secret scars.
