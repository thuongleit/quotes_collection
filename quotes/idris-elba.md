 - I love working. I’m a workaholic and I’m really privileged for some of the jobs I get offered and so I just want to keep going.

 - My Father always told me that a fool at 40 is a fool for life.
 - I come from an era, in my world, where you just had to define yourself as who you are and what you do. I happen to be an actor. I happen to be someone that loves to act, that also likes music, that also likes to speak, and that also has an opinion.
 - I wasn’t bad at school, but I was never a bookworm.
 - There’s the argument that you can relate to someone who’s completely unrelatable. In the way that a director shows you his imagination on a film, then I get to show you my imagination in a big dumb character.
 - Waking up in TRUTH is so much better than living in a lie.
 - In ‘Pacific Rim’ I had to have a haircut I wouldn’t usually rock. However, the moustache I had in the film – that might have to come out again. It was a good moustache. Good times.

 - I love bikes. I used to own one, but I fell off it when I was younger and that was the end of my bike riding days until now.
 - I’m never shaken or stirred.
 - I was in The Wire for three years, and I left at the highlight of that.
 - The only thing I change mainly is my sneakers. I love sneakers. But everything’s sort of black or jeans. Jeans, always.
 - I think ‘The Wire’ really is relatable. It reflects an ongoing issue across America, about inaccuracies in major cities between rich and the poor and some of the things that go on behind the red tape of council and government bodies.
 - The long and short of it is that I am now in a position in England to green light movies, and that’s really excellent – not high-budget movies, but movies none the less.
 - I’m rebelling against being handed a career, like, ‘You’re the next this; you’re the next that.’ I’m not the next anything, I’m the first me. I can’t be myself, I can’t just be Idris Elba. But that’s just the nature of the business.
 - The one album I can’t live without is called ‘Cumbolo’ by a band called Culture. Every song on their album is deep, but there’s one in particular called ‘This Train.’ I have a tattoo of the lyrics on my left arm.
 - If I was gonna go to jail, I don’t want to go to jail for stealing a bottle of water. I’ll steal that $20 million. At least then it was worth it.
 - When I look at my body of work, I’ve played a lot of characters who are morally conflicted – ‘I’m right, no I’m wrong, I don’t know what to do!’ I want to play more characters who don’t care as much, and who aren’t as measured. They are what they are, no apologies.

 - The less I talk about being black, the better.

 - Television, for me, is a medium that I’m probably always going to be attached to, one way or another.
 - The adrenaline feeling of jumping out of cliffs and bikes and all of that is very specific to the film. In ‘Pac Rim’ I’m not doing that so much. There isn’t that touch stonework for me in it, but there is a lot of action.
 - The English are good at bad guys – the James Bond-style villain, cunning, slow-burning. The Americans are much more obvious about it.
 - In some countries, no one knows who Idris Elba is.
 - I’m not a popular actor. I don’t necessarily want to be famous. I want to be known for great work. I want to be known to surprise audiences.
 - What really excites me in a project is when it goes in a way you haven’t been before.
 - I’m tactile, very tactile. A woman who has really nice, looked-after skin is such a turn-on for me. It’s always sexy.

 - Bond? It is a bit like saying, ‘Do you want to play Superman?’ Anyone would dream of it. It’s one of the most coveted roles in film. I’d be honoured. But I don’t know if it will actually happen. I’m just happy with the idea of being associated with it. It’s nice there’s a lot of good will.
 - I’m a little sheepish about it. Whenever I meet fans and they’re like, ‘Oh, you’re so sexy,’ I just don’t get that. There’s no way one man can be universally sexy.
 - I tend to stay away from the comics.
 - Because I was big, I didn’t have to listen to anyone doubting me. I was just considered good at football or whatever, there were no questions about it.

 - Working at BBC, at the head of one of the top dramas, is a tradition for great actors.

 - I love to play different roles. That’s just the kind of actor I am.
 - Apparently, Daniel Craig said I’d be a great Bond. Daniel, why did you say that? Dropped me right in it! What an honor it would be, but also, what an indication of change.
 - I’ve always been DJing; it’s just I’m making more of a push for it, making it more public.
 - I’m not interested in making all-black films – I come from a very diverse culture; I want to work with every type of person. I work a lot with women executives because they seem to be a lot more open minded about that and a lot more progressive in that way.
 - Nobody likes a celebrity DJ for the sake of style, so I don’t do that – I try to be good at what I do. It’s all about resetting, it’s my escape. It is work, it’s a job, but I just love doing it.
 - As an actor, you’re trained to do the right thing, be politically correct, say your lines, say the right thing about the people you’re working with.
 - As much as it’s nice to step into that massive world of Hollywood and be a big, famous actor, I prefer the career of actors that have really chosen smartly and done really amazing performances. Maybe they’re not as known, but their careers are a bit more interesting.

 - Every single film I’ve done, it’s about the character.
 - I was cast in ‘Thor’ and I’m cast as a Nordic god. If you know anything about the Nords, they don’t look like me but there you go. I think that’s a sign of the times for the future. I think we will see multi-level casting. I think we will see that, and I think that’s good.
 - I’ll always be attached to telly in one way or another, whether it’s a character or producer or director, I just love the medium.
