 - Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.
 - Climb the mountain not to plant your flag, but to embrace the challenge, enjoy the air and behold the view. Climb it so you can see the world, not so the world can see you.
 - History is a guide to navigation in perilous times. History is who we are and why we are the way we are.
 - If everyone is special, then no one is. If everyone gets a trophy, trophies become meaningless.
 - You can’t learn to play the piano without playing the piano, you can’t learn to write without writing, and, in many ways, you can’t learn to think without thinking. Writing is thinking. To write well is to think clearly. That’s why it’s so hard.
 - Curiosity is what separates us from the cabbages. It’s accelerative. The more we know, the more we want to know.

 - When the founders wrote about life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, they didn’t mean longer vacations and more comfortable hammocks. They meant the pursuit of learning. The pursuit of improvement and excellence. In hard work is happiness.
 - There’s no such thing as a foreseeable future.

 - I lament the want of a liberal education. I feel the mist of ignorance to surround me – Nathanael Greene.

 - Every book is a new journey. I never felt I was an expert on a subject as I embarked on a project.

 - A leader must look and act the part.
 - Courage is contagious. If a leader shows courage, others get the idea.
 - We should draw on our story, we should draw on our history. If we don’t know who we are, if we don’t know how we became what we are, we’re going to start suffering from all the obvious detrimental effects of amnesia.
 - If the attitude of the teacher toward the material is positive, enthusiastic, committed and excited, the students get that. If the teacher is bored, students get that and they get bored, quickly, instinctively.
 - Your education never stops and college is just the beginning. You come out of college with a huge advantage in that you’ve ideally and more times than not you’ve come out with a love of learning and that’s what matters above all.
 - You can’t love what you don’t know much about. You can’t convince, stimulate, hold the attention, teach, if you don’t know what you’re talking about.

 - There’s an awful temptation to just keep on researching. There comes a point where you just have to stop, and start writing.
 - The fulfilling life, the distinctive life, the relevant life is an achievement. To do whatever you do for no reason other than you love it and believe in its importance.

 - I think that we need history as much as we need bread or water or love.
 - I think that a good education ought to be in part the idea that ease and joy are not synonymous. Some of the most fulfilling pleasures of life are to be found in work – found in work you love to do, work you want to do, work that makes you want to get out of bed in the morning.
 - We are raising a generation of young Americans who are, to a very large degree, historically illiterate. It’s not their faults. There’s no problem about enlisting their interest in history. None. The problem is the teachers so often have no history in their background.

 - One of the things about the arts that is so important is that in the arts you discover the only way to learn how to do it is by doing it. You can’t write by reading a book about it. The only way to learn how to write a book is to sit down and try to write a book.

 - Read. Read every chance you get. Read to keep growing. Read history. Read poetry. Read for pure enjoyment. Read a book called Life on a Little Known Planet. It’s about insects. It will make you feel better.
 - We must not think of learning as only what happens in schools. It is an extended part of life. The most readily available resource for all of life is our public library system.

 - When you start to write, things begin to come into focus in a way they don’t when you’re not writing. It’s a very good way to find out how much you don’t know because you learn specifically what you need to know that you don’t know at the moment by writing.

 - I love Dickens. I love the way he sets a scene.
 - I can fairly be called an amateur because I do what I do, in the original sense of the word – for love, because I love it. On the other hand, I think that those of us who make our living writing history can also be called true professionals.
 - I love to go to the places where things happen. I like to walk the walk and see how the light falls and what winter feels like.

 - The title always comes last. What I really work hard on is the beginning. Where do you begin? In what tone do you begin? I almost have to have a scene in my mind.
