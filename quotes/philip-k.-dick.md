 - It is sometimes an appropriate response to reality to go insane.

 - It is amazing that when someone else spouts the nonsense you yourself believe you can readily perceive it as nonsense.
 - God can be good and terrible-not in succession-but at the same time. This is why we seek a mediator between us and him; we approach him through the mediating priest and attenuate and enclose him through the sacraments. It is for our own safety: to trap him within confines which render him safe.
