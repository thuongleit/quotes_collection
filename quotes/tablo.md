 - I’m afraid I’ll be a book that no one reads. Music that no one listens to anymore. I’m afraid I’ll be abandoned like a movie playing in an empty theater.
 - It didn’t rain for you, maybe, but it always rains for me. The sky shatters and rains shards of glass.
 - My heart was closed. Cold. I was self-conscious and cynical.
 - Cowards, I believe, are people who are afraid to embrace what they want or need in a natural, honest way.
