 - I’m world champion, baby!
 - For me, triathlons were something that was down to me and my fitness. Now, I really enjoy the pain in the triathlon of chasing someone down. It’s a bit like chasing down Nico Rosberg in the last few laps at Silverstone – it makes you feel alive.
 - I haven’t got the yacht any more. The cost of running it was crazy. But it was so much fun while I had it. I don’t regret it.

 - It is such a special feeling to win a grand prix.
 - It doesn’t matter how much money you’ve got, or how many connections, there’s always something you want that’s out of reach.
 - If someone was making a movie about F1 in the last six months, they wouldn’t need to add a Hollywood ending. If they do make that movie, it’s got to be ‘The Curious Case Of ,’ where I’ve lived my life backwards. I’d like Johnny Depp to play me but he wouldn’t be quite right.
 - I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I’m 6ft and I’m 70kg so I haven’t much fat on me.
 - When it comes to my racing career I’m very driven and very selfish. People who are around me at races will know that I’m a different person here than in my personal life. I completely blank people at races. I need to be focused. I’m rude.
 - The fast, flowing parts, the high-speed corners, that’s where a Formula One car is at its best – changes of direction, pulling high g-forces left and right.
 - My father did everything for me. He was awesome.
 - I can’t eat whatever I want, definitely not. I’m always controlled because I do a lot of fitness and triathlons, not just Formula One, so I always make sure I eat the right things.
 - When I do retire, I know for a fact that I’ll never be able to replace the incredible feeling I get when I’m driving an F1 car.

 - A lot of people think Formula One isn’t a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we’re pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.
 - I need to develop a car and engineer a car in a position that feels comfortable for me, and I don’t think anyone can do a better job than I can in that position. The problem for me is if I can’t get the car there I do struggle more than some.
 - In the car and in front of the camera I tend to be very calm but behind the scenes I can get fired up and passionate, I just don’t see the need to shout my mouth off in public.
 - I don’t purposely speed, but I might go over by five or six miles an hour from time to time. It doesn’t give me a buzz driving on normal roads, because I can’t go fast enough. It’s never going to be anything like an F1 car.
 - When you’re in a car which can win every race, or fight for a win every race, that is pressure.

 - I always think I should try to get to bed early, but then I can’t stop myself from watching telly and fiddling around on the net.
 - Resting for me is fitness training.
 - When I was in Japan with my girlfriend Jessica, she would have had acupuncture every day if she could. I can just about stomach going to a chiropractor and I visited a talented one when I was there, but when he tried a needle on me, it was horrible. My muscles tightened and it didn’t work at all.

 - In my hometown there is a pub named after me – The Frome Flyer on Jenson Avenue. How cool is that?!
 - To understand the intensity of driving an F1 car, you have to be in it.
 - If I run I lose so much weight, which I need because you’re limited on weight when you are a tall driver. And have you seen marathon runners? They’re quite skinny.

 - I felt confident at 24, but I am a better driver now.
 - I’ve spent as much as 30 grand on a watch but it’s not about flaunting my wealth. I don’t have many extravagances but watches are my biggest one. I must have 30 of them now. I’ve been collecting since the age of nine, when I won a black TAG in a karting event.
