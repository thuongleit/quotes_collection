 - Food is as important as energy, as security, as the environment. Everything is linked together.
 - Food, in the end, in our own tradition, is something holy. It’s not about nutrients and calories. It’s about sharing. It’s about honesty. It’s about identity.
 - There is no technical reason why we could not feed a world of nine billion people. Hunger is a matter of buying power, not of shortages.
 - Our food is safer and our diets are more diverse than ever before; production methods are becoming increasingly sustainable, clean and efficient; and we are constantly becoming better at protecting biodiversity.
