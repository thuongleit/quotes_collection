 - A good book is never finished – -it goes on whispering to you from the wall.
 - Some people make a bad bed, they just have to lie in it.
 - You get older and you are a whole mess of things, new thoughts, sorry feelings, big plans, enormous doubts, goling along hoping and getting disappointed, over and over again, no wonder I don’t recognize my little crayon picture. It appears to be me and it is and it is not.
 - You ever laughed so hard nobody in the world could hurt you for a minute, no matter what they tried to do to you?
 - Rise to the occassion which is life!
