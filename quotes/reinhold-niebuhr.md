 - Humor is a prelude to faith and laughter is the beginning of prayer.

 - History is a realm in which human freedom and natural necessity are curiously intermingled.
 - Marxism is the modern form of Jewish prophecy.
 - The dimension of depth in the consciousness of religion creates the tension between what is and what ought to be. It bends the bow from which every arrow of moral action flies.
