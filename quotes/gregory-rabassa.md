 - Every act of communication is an act of translation.
 - I have always maintained that translation is essentially the closest reading one can possibly give a text. The translator cannot ignore “lesser” words, but must consider every jot and tittle.
 - A translator is essentially a reader and we all read differently, except that a translator’s reading remains in unchanging print.
 - A translation can never equal the original; it can approach it, and its quality can only be judged as to accuracy by how close it gets.
 - Translation is a disturbing craft because there is precious little certainty about what we are doing, which makes it so difficult in this age of fervent belief and ideology, this age or greed and screed.
 - Teaching translation is more of an editing job. You act as editor. But you can have fun with it.
 - When you hear Portuguese, if you’re listening fleetingly, it’s as if you’re hearing Russian, which never happens with Spanish. Because the Portuguese and the Russians share the open vowels and the dark “L,” the “owL” sound.
