 - We only came close to dying six or seven times which I thought was pretty good. A minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch of moss and her foot slipped. Fortunately she found something else to put it against. Unfortunately that something was my face.
 - Oh, my dear! I’m afraid you’ve mistaken me for someone else! My name is Rhea Silvia. I was the mother to Romulus and Remus, thousands of years ago. But you’re so kind to think I look as young as the 1950s.
 - Our secret weapon, Khione! We’re not just a bunch of demigods. We’re a team.

 - Well that was sucktastic.
 - The dead aren’t scary. They are just sad.

 - Grover: It’s a very sweet love story. I get misty-eyed every time I play it. So does Percy, but I think that’s because he’s laughing at me.

 - The truth hit him. Jason wasn’t quite Roman anymore. His time at Camp Half-Blood had changed him. Reyna had recognized that. Apparently, so did the undead legionnaires. If Jason no longer gave off the right sort of vibe, or aura of a Roman leader...
 - Khufu carefully picked out everything that ended with-o – Doritos, Oreos, and some chunks of meat. Buffalo? Armadillo? I was scared to even ask.
 - I felt like one of Apollo’s sacred cows- slow, dumb, and bright red.
 - He looked like those paintings of baby angels – what do you call them, hubbubs? No cherubs. That’s it. He looked like a cherub who’d turned middle-aged in a trailer park.
 - Oh, don’t mind me! Just the queen of the heavens, dying over here!
 - I want some time without you organic life forms.
 - Leo had seen Tia Callida in action; she liked knives, snakes and putting babies in roaring fires. Yeah, definitely let’s unleash her rage. Great idea.
 - Maybe, standing next to the obelisk of Ma’at, surrounded by the Sea of Chaos, we both realized that restraining ourselves from vengeance is what made us different from Apophis. Rules had their place. They kept us from unraveling.
 - We’ll have to work on your bunny phobia later.
 - You’re cute when you’re worried, your eyebrows get all scrunched together.
 - Christmas in the Underworld was NOT my idea. If I’d known what was coming, I would’ve called in sick. I could’ve avoided an army of demons, a fight with a Titan, and a trick that almost got my friends and me cast into eternal darkness. But no, I had to take my stupid English exam.
 - My girlfriend: sophomore honors student, demigod, and – oh, yeah – head architect for redesigning the palace of the gods on Mount Olympus in her spare time.
 - My mother says looking is the nature of wisdom.
 - Nico drank from the chalice, then offered it to Jason. “You asked me about trust, and taking a risk? Well, here you go, son of Jupiter. How much do you trust me?” Frank wasn’t sure what Nico was talking about, but Jason didn’t hesitate. He took the cup and drank.
 - Percy tried to remember. He really did. For some reason, Annabeth and he had visited a spa and decided to destroy it. He couldn’t imagine why. Maybe they hadn’t like the deep-tissue massage? Maybe they’d gotten bad manicures?
 - All right, cupcakes. You are about to see the Grand Canyon. Try not to break it. The skywalk can hold the weight of seventy jumbo jets, to you featherweights should be safe out there. If possible, try to avoid pushing each other over the edge, as that would cause me extra paperwork.
 - Am I a troubled kid? Yeah, you could say that.
 - Lots of death, huh? Personally, I’m trying to avoid lots of death, but you guys have fun!
 - Gods have great power, but only humans have creativity, the power to change history.
 - That’s what being a demigod was all about, not quite belonging in the mortal world or on Mount Olympus but trying to make peace with both sides of their nature.
 - My understanding of magic is fairly straightforward. Hit enemies with a sword until they’re dead. If they rise again, hit them again. Repeat as necessary. It worked against Set.
 - Before I could figure out how to apologize for being such an idiot, she tackled me with a hug, then pulled away just as quickly. “I’m glad you’re not a guinea pig.” “Me, too.” I hoped my face wasn’t as red as it felt.
 - I gave her a smile that I hoped conveyed something like: Hey, you know I’m on your side. Gods are such jerks! But what can you do? Probably my expression actually conveyed: It’s not my fault! Please do not kill me!
 - Perseus, you are not the hero.
 - The dead see what they believe they will see. So do the living. That is the secret.
 - You assume that it has to be a male god who finds a human female attractive? How sexist is that?

 - Kids are baby goats. They’re cute and they have redeeming social value. You are definitely not kids.
 - Travis: The Aphrodite kids were ripping each other’s clothes and throwing lipstick and jewellery. It was like a rabid herd of wild Bratz.
 - Before Keto could notice, Hedge pointed towards the top of the amphitheater. It looked like he might be screaming, Gods of Olympus, what is that? Keto turned. Coach Hedge promptly took off his fake foot and ninja-kicked her in the back of the head with his goat hoof.
 - Getting eaten by a giant crocodile was bad enough. The kid with the glowing sword only made my day worse.
 - Leo. Jason said, you’re wierd. Yeah, you tell me that a lot. Leo grinned. But if you don’t remember me, that means I can reuse all my old jokes. Come on!
 - You drool when you sleep.
 - Sanchez looked at me and we locked eyes a second too long. There was nothing I could do about it. The signal went out. A moment of clear, silent hostility passed between us as hotly charged and unintentional as a thousand-volt arc through a squirrel.
 - You began your journey here as a pup. Now you must find your way back. A new quest, a new start.
 - Yeah, well. I don’t try to be awesome. It just comes natural.
 - If you don’t like it you can kiss my quiver.
 - I’d love to tell you I had some deep revelation on my way down, that I came to terms with my own mortality, laughed in the face of death, et cetera. The truth? My only thought was: Aaaaggghhhhh!
 - As we rose over the rooftops I caught my breath-well, if you can catch your breath underwater.
 - Our baboon was going completely sky goddess – which is to say, nuts.
 - I tried to think of something to say. Excuse me? Hello? Marry me? Anything would have done.
 - Sadie Kane here. If you’re listening to this, congratulations, you survived doomsday.
 - Akhlys lunged at Percy, and for a split second he thought: Well, hey, I’m just smoke. She can’t touch me, right? He imagined the Fates up in Olympus, laughing at his wishful thinking: LOL, NOOB!
 - I must admit I’m impressed, Sadie. You controlled your magic and controlled Isis. And you, Carter, did well turning into a lizard.
 - My experience with Khonsu had taught me not be greedy about time. It was best to appreciate what you had and not yearn for more.
 - Monsters don’t die. They just dissipate into smoke and dust, which saves heroes a lot of trouble cleaning up after a fight.
 - Calm down, Horus said. “Don’t tell me to calm down!” Bast frowned. “I didn’t.” “Talking to him!” I pointed at my forehead.
 - A ruby-encrusted orb popped its top and helicopter blades unfolded. Leo was glad Buford the table wasn’t here-he would’ve fallen in love.
 - I think kids will read more good books than we can possibly produce.
 - Piper gave Lit a friendly sorry-about-that smile. Even with her hair messed up and wearing two-day-old clothes, she looked extremely cute, and Jason felt a little jealous she was giving Lit that smile.
 - Poseidon held out his arms and gave me a hug. I realized, a little embarrassed, that I’d never actually hugged my dad before. He was warm – like a regular human – and he smelled of a salty beach and fresh sea air.
 - She deserved at least one person who saw her and knew how good she was.
 - I didn’t answer, but, please – nothing is obvious with boys. For such simple creatures, they are quite baffling.
 - It’s useless to lecture a human.
 - Gods forbid if she ever broke up with him. She’d never be able to visit the sea again without remembering her broken heart. Annabeth about Percy.
 - You mix Greek and Roman, you know what you get? You get BAM!
 - Maybe it’s okay to still be a kid every once in a while.
 - Annabeth realized that if six of them went on these two quests, it would leave Percy alone on the ship with Coach Hedge, which was maybe not a situation a caring girlfriend should put him in. Nor was she eager to let Percy out of her sight again – not after they’d been apart for so many months.
 - He could’t have survied a hundred foot drop. I’m sorry Annabeth.
 - I got ready for bed and crawled in. The covers were comfortable and warm, but the pillow was just too weird. It gave me neck cramps, so I put it on the floor and went to sleep without it. My first big mistake.
 - I think every writer struggles in some way with writers block. The trick is to plan out what you are going to say beforehand. I found out that if you make an outline you’re much less likely to get blocked when you get into the middle of the story.
 - Teach you to try marrying me, you idiot!
 - Heroes like you always have a weak spot. We just have to find it, and then we can kill you. Won’t that be lovely? Have a cheese ‘n’ Wiener!
 - And I was holding someone who was destined to be my best friend, or possibly my worst enemy.
 - I stepped forward. Call me old-fashioned, but I wanted to keep his focus on me and not Annabeth. I think it’s polite for a guy to protect his girlfriend from instant incineration.
 - If not for the horses, Piper would’ve died.
 - Tyson thought Annabeth was just about the coolest thing since peanut butter, and he SERIOUSLY loved peanut butter.
 - We were just looking at maps...

 - I’ve always found the second book in a series is the hardest to write.
 - If my mom told one more story about how cute I looked in the bathtub when I was three years old I was going to burrow into the snow and freeze myself to death.

 - Here’s a tip, Alyconeus. Next time you choose the biggest state for your home, don’t set up base in the part that’s only 10 miles wide. Welcome to Canada, idiot.

 - I’ve always liked the idea that writing is a form of travel. And I started my writing career as a mystery novelist for adults.
 - Rachel: They asked me a lot of questions about you. I played dumb. Annabeth: Was it hard?
 - One basketball to rule them all.

 - I may be biased, but I think jackals are cute and cuddly, even if they were known for digging up graves in Ancient Egypt.

 - Never bet against a cat.
 - I heard Amos yell, “For Brooklyn!” It was an odd battle cry.

 - People usually asked her if she had a belly button. Of course she had a belly button. She couldn’t explain how. She didn’t really want to know.

 - Staplers – Excellent source of iron.
 - Until she met the exploding statue, Annabeth thought she was prepared for anything.

 - We’d just released a zebra in Las Vegas.
 - We swallowed a few bites-not to much scince the food of the gods can burn you to ashes is you overindulge. I guess thats why you don’t see many fat gods.
