 - Life is movement. Once you stop moving, youâ€™re dead. Choose life.
 - Health is a divine gift, and the care of the body is a sacred duty, to neglect which is to sin.
 - Civilisation has, indeed, become a slaughtering-car crowned by a grinning effigy of Comfort, before which man blindly and voluntarily hurls himself in his own ignorance.
