 - Peace is not everything, but without peace, everything is nothing.
 - Peace, like freedom, is no original state which existed from the start; we shall have to make it, in the truest sense of the word.
 - Morally it makes no difference whether a person is killed in war or condemned to starve by the indifference of others.
 - One has to keep in mind the countless human tragedies that played out in these days. Through the middle of a city, where several thousand connections existed daily, despite administrative division, the concrete pillars were driven into the border, which was expanded like a Chinese wall.
 - You may buy from me in your own language, but sell to me in mine.
 - Peace is something more than the absence of war, although some nations would be thankful for that alone today. A durable and equitable peace system requires equal development opportunities for all nations.
