 - There are things that drift away like our endless, numbered days. ~~Iron & Wine
 - We all assume the worst the best we can. ~~Iron & Wine
 - I put my energy into writing songs. I have to carve out a living somehow doing this, and licensing is one way. It’s hard to register what’s “too much” for other people.

 - The song succeeds or fails just based on whether you argue your point successfully. I like throwing images together, which create meaning if you listen to it one time, but if you listen to it another time you might get a different meaning. ~~Iron & Wine
 - I had all these songs lying around. They had all these woman characters, and I thought the idea of the Woman King would be a good way to tie them all together. ~~Iron & Wine
