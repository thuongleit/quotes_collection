 - Art is the creation of forms symbolic of human feeling.
 - Philosophizing is a process of making sense out of experience...
 - The seeds of civilization are in every culture, but it is city life that brings them to fruition.
 - Music is the tonal analogue of emotive life.
 - If we would have new knowledge, we must get a whole world of new questions.
 - Only a creature that can think symbolically about life can conceive of its own death. Our knowledge of death is part of our knowledge of life.
 - Music is our myth of the inner life...
 - Artistic form is congruent with the dynamic forms of our direct sensuous, mental, and emotional life; works of art are projections of “felt life”, as Henry James called it, into spatial, temporal, and poetic structures.
 - Common-sense knowledge is prompt, categorical, and inexact.
 - Fire is a natural symbol of life and passion, though it is the one element in which nothing can actually live.
 - The first impression of a work of art is its otherness from reality.
 - The arts objectify subjective reality, and subjectify outward experience of nature. Art education is the education of feeling, and a society that neglects it gives itself up to formless emotion. Bad art is corruption of feeling.
 - In human life, art may arise from almost any activity, and once it does so, it is launched on a long road of exploration, invention, freedom to the limits of extravagance, interference to the point of frustration, finally discipline, controlling constant change and growth.
 - Tragedy dramatizes human life as potentiality and fulfillment. Its virtual future, or Destiny, is therefore quite different from that created in comedy. Comic Destiny is Fortune.
 - As comedy presents the vital rhythm of self-preservation, tragedy exhibits that of self-consummation.
 - Cinema is like dream.
 - Magic, then, is not a method, but a language; it is part and parcel of that greater phenomenon, ritual, which is the language of religion. Ritual is a symbolic transformation of experiences that no other medium can adequately express.
 - Art is the objectification of feeling, and the subjectification of nature.
 - Speech is the mark of humanity. It is the normal terminus of thought.
 - The intellectual treatment of any datum, any experience, any subject, is determined by the nature of our questions, and only carried out in the answers.
 - The high intellectual value of images, however, lies in the fact that they usually, and perhaps always, fit more than one actual experience.
 - The continual pursuit of meanings-wider, clearer, more negotiable, more articulate meanings- is philosophy.
 - Music is ‘significant form,’ and its significance is that of a symbol, a highly articulated, sensuous object, which by virtue of its dynamic structure can express the forms of vital experience which language is peculiarly unfit to convey. Feeling, life, motion and emotion constitute its import.
 - We have no physical model of this endless rhythm of individuation and involvement, we do have its image in the world of art, most purely in dance.
 - Most new discoveries are suddenly-seen things that were always there. A new idea is a light that illuminates presences which simply had no form before the light fell on them.
 - The historian does not locate known facts in a hypothetical, general pattern of processes; his aim is to link fact to fact, one unique knowable event to another individual one that begot it.
 - The way a question is asked limits and disposes the ways in which any answer to it-right or wrong-may be given.
 - Every artistic form reflects the dynamism that is constantly building up the life of feeling.
 - The fairytale is irresponsible; it is frankly imaginary, and its purpose is to gratify wishes, as a dream doth flatter.
 - Is it conceivable that mysticism is a mark of inadequate art?
 - A signal is comprehended if it serves to make us notice the object or situation it bespeaks. A symbol is understood when we conceive the idea it presents.
 - One can bear anything of which one is able to conceive.
 - The function of art is to acquaint the beholder with something he has not known before.
 - The Past, being in the mode of memory, is closed, inalienable, and irreparable...
 - Feeling, in the broad sense of whatever is felt in any way, as sensory stimulus or inward tension, pain, emotion or intent, is the mark of mentality.
 - Real thinking is possible only in the light of genuine language, no matter how limited, how primitive.
 - Ritual is the most primitive reflection of serious thought, a slow deposit, as it were, of people’s imaginative insight into life.
 - The development of beings with minds is probably the highest individuation the world has ever known, and its prehistory is the history of life on earth.
 - All persistent practices in art have a creative function. They may serve several ends, but the chief one is the shaping of the work.
 - A philosophy is characterized more by the formulation of its problem than by its solution of them.
 - Pioneering is the work of individuals...
 - Language is, without a doubt, the most momentous and at the same time the most mysterious product of the human mind.
 - Nature, as man has always known it, he knows no more. Since he has learned to esteem signs above symbols, to suppress his emotional reactions in favor of practical ones and make use of nature instead of holding so much of it sacred, he has altered the face, if not the heart, of reality.
 - Most new discoveries are suddenly-seen things that were always there.
 - What is artistically good is whatever articulates and presents feeling to our understanding.
 - The limits of thought are not so much set from outside, by the fullness or poverty of experiences that meet the mind, as from within, by the power of conception, the wealth of formulative notions with which the mind meets experiences.
 - It is significant that people who refuse to tell their children fairytales do not fear that the children will believe in princes and princesses, but that they will believe in witches and bogeys.
 - Art is just as comprehensible as science, but in its own terms...
 - If a work of art is a projection of feeling, its kinship with organic nature will emerge, no matter through how many transformations, logically and inevitably.
