 - I think one of my pursuits over the years is trying to answer the question of, ‘What else can you do with a voice other than stand in front of a microphone and sing?’
 - Emotion creates reality, reality demands action.
 - What matters in modern music is not the part you can write down, the words and the tune, but the rest – the texture, the atmosphere, the references and associations.

 - I do sometimes look back at things I’ve written in the past, and think, ‘I just don’t remember being the person who wrote that.’
 - Well, I am a dilettante. It’s only in England that dilettantism is considered a bad thing. In other countries it’s called interdisciplinary research.
 - Instead of shooting arrows at someone elses target, which Ive never been very good at, I make my own target around wherever my arrow happens to have landed. You shoot your arrow and then you paint your bulls eye around it, and therefore you have hit the target dead centre.
 - The smart thing in the art world is to have one good idea and never have another.
 - Every increase in your knowledge is a simultaneous decrease. You learn and you unlearn at the same time. A new certainty is a new doubt as well.
 - The trouble begins with a design philosophy that equates ‘more options’ with ‘greater freedom.’
 - A big ego isn’t necessarily a bad thing. A big ego means that you have some confidence in your abilities, really, and that you’re prepared to take the risk of trying them out.
 - If there is a new fascism, it won’t come from skinheads and punks; it will come from people who eat granola and think they know how the world should be.

 - If you want to make someone feel emotion, you have to make them let go. Listening to something is an act of surrender.
 - Every collaboration helps you grow. With Bowie, it’s different every time. I know how to create settings, unusual aural environments. That inspires him. He’s very quick.
 - Avant-garde music is sort of research music. You’re glad someone’s done it but you don’t necessarily want to listen to it.
 - Well, there are some things that I just can’t get out of my head, and they start to annoy me after a while. Sometimes they’re of my own creation, as well – and they’re just as annoying. It’s not only other people’s ear worms that bug me, it’s my own, as well.

 - In England and Europe, we have this huge music called ambient – ambient techno, ambient house, ambient hip-hop, ambient this, ambient that.
 - I always use the same guitar; I got this guitar years and years ago for nine pounds. It’s still got the same strings on it.
 - I remember when in the early days of rock’n’roll, when everything sounded totally different, all amazing and blah blah blah blah blah. Now you can play me one second of any record from that time, and I’ll say “1959” or “1961.” I can hear precisely. It’s like it has a huge date stamp on it.
 - Sometimes something intrigues me about particular sounds, how they work together, and I think “Okay, I’ve found something here; I’m going to take it somewhere.” And sometimes just to find a name for that sound, whatever it is, ends up becoming a title of the piece or becoming part of the title.

 - The great benefit of computer sequencers is that they remove the issue of skill, and replace it with the issue of judgement.

 - A part of me has become immortal, out of my control.
 - I wanted to use the studio like a microscope for sound, which is what good engineers do.

 - All music has political dimensions because it suggests a way of being.
 - When people censor themselves they’re just as likely to get rid of the good bits as the bad bits.
 - Music in itself carries a whole set of messages which are very, very rich and complex, and the words either serve to exclude certain ones or point up certain others.

 - American television really is pathetic.
 - Don’t be ashamed of your own ideas. Most musicians get applauded for sounding like someone else.

 - I hate the way CDs just drone on for bloody hours and you stop caring.
 - I had a lot of trouble with engineers, because their whole background is learning from a functional point of view, and then learning how to perform that function.
 - I describe things in terms of body movements. I dance a bit to describe what sort of movement it ought to make, and that’s a good way of talking to musicians. Particularly bass players.

 - I hate talking about music, to tell you the truth.
 - There are certain sounds that I’ve found work well in nearly any context. Their function is not so much musical as spatial: they define the edges of the territory of the music.
 - One of the things you’re doing when you make art, apart from entertaining yourself and other people, is trying to see what ways of working feel good, what feels right.
 - People do dismiss ambient music, don’t they? They call it ‘easy listening,’ as if to suggest that it should be hard to listen to.
 - When I was young, an eccentric uncle decided to teach me how to lie. Not, he explained, because he wanted me to lie, but because he thought I should know how it’s done so I would recognise when I was being lied to.
 - More and more I find I want to be living in a Big Here and a Long Now.
 - I have lived in countries that were coming out of conflict: Ireland, South Africa, the Czech republic. People there are overflowing with energy.
 - Everybody thinks that when new technologies come along that they’re transparent and you can just do your job well on it. But technologies always import a whole new set of values with them.

 - Also something that you don’t have to listen to from beginning to end – you can enter at any point and leave at any point.
 - It’s amazing how quickly people get used to bad quality.
 - I despise computers in many ways. I think they’re hopelessly underevolved and overrated.
 - It infuriates me that stuff from the Internet routinely doesn’t include all the credits. Because as soon as I listen to something, if I like it, I want to know, “Who’s the bass player?” “Who did that?” “Who’s the engineer on this?”
 - A culture is the sum of all the things about which humanity can choose to differ.
 - My kind of composing is more like the work of a gardener. The gardener takes his seeds and scatters them, knowing what he is planting but not quite what will grow where and when – and he won’t necessarily be able to reproduce it again afterwards either.
 - I’d love it if American kids were listening to Muslim music.
 - The difficulty of always feeling that you ought to be doing something is that you tend to undervalue the times when you’re apparently doing nothing, and those are very important times.
 - I enjoy working with complicated equipment. A lot of my things started just with a rhythm box, but I feed it through so many things that what comes out sounds very complex and rich.
 - I do love being in my studio. Especially at night.

 - I don’t like celebrity programmes – but I do like programmes about how ideas are formed and evolve.
 - I want to make things that put me in the position of innocence, that recreate the feeling of innocence in you.
 - The reason I don’t tour is that I don’t know how to front a band. What would I do? I can’t really play anything well enough to deal with that situation.
 - I’m always interested in something when it isn’t familiar to me.
 - Perhaps when music has been shouting for so long, a quieter voice seems attractive.
 - You don’t have to act as if you know what you’re doing.
 - With all fashion, what we do is play at being somebody else. We play at inhabiting another kind of world.
 - I have these headphones, which pretty much exclude everything else so that you can really completely control the sound that you’re hearing. I don’t use them very much, I have to say. I very rarely listen on headphones.
 - I set up situations that involve abandoning control and finding out what happens.

 - I take sounds and change them into words.
 - For the world to be interesting, you have to be manipulating it all the time.
 - I often say to people that producing is the best paid form of cowardice. When you produce things you almost always get credit, if it’s a good record, but you hardly ever get the blame if it’s not! You don’t really take responsibility for your work.
 - We are increasingly likely to find ourselves in places with background music. No composers have thought to write for these modern spaces, which represent 30% of our musical experience.

 - I make a lot of pieces of music that I never release as CDs.
 - Composition is a way of living out your philosophy and calling it art.

 - If you’ve spent a long time developing a skill and techniques, and now some 14 year-old upstart can get exactly the same result, you might feel a bit miffed I suppose, but that has happened forever.
 - You either believe that people respond to authority, or that they respond to kindness and inclusion. I’m obviously in the latter camp. I think that people respond better to reward than punishment.
 - Put out as much as you can. It doesn’t do anything sitting on a shelf.
 - I think most artists would be happy to have bigger audiences rather than smaller ones. It doesn’t mean that they are going to change their work in order necessarily to get it, but they’re happy if they do get it.
 - The problem with improvisation is, of course, that everyone just slips into their comfort zone and does sort of the easy thing to do, the most obvious thing to do with your instrument.
 - I believe in singing.
 - It’s easy to forget that your best work is done when your attention is fully engaged.
 - I know that if I had a television in my flat I would convince myself that everything on it was really interesting. I would say, ‘I’m a Celebrity – Get Me Out of Here!’ is so sociologically fascinating that I think I’d better watch.
 - I’ve got a feeling that music might not be the most interesting place to be in the world of things.
 - Nothing so dates an era as its conception of the future.
 - It’s nice, I think, when people use your music for things you didn’t think of.
 - If I tried to make a commercial album, it would be a complete flop. I have no idea what the world at large likes.
 - A studio is an absolute labyrinth of possibilities – this is why records take so long to make because there are millions of permutations of things you can do. The most useful thing you can do is to get rid of some of those options before you start.

 - One often makes music to supplement one’s world.
 - Everybody is entertained to death.
 - If you are part of a religion that very strongly insists that you believe then to decide not to do that is quite a big hurdle to jump over. You never forget the thought process you went through. It becomes part of your whole intellectual picture.
 - Most big concerts sound disgusting and awful and insultingly bad. It’s like going to the cinema and been shown a scratchy film which is upsidedown and the bulb had gone on the projector. The quality of large-scale live music is so shocking.

 - The most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten.
 - I’m bloody awful at multi-tasking.
 - Reggie Watts is a most unusual talent: a huge vocal range, a natural musicality, and a sidesplitting wit. Is he a comedian? A singer? A performance artist? I’ve seen him a few times since then and I still can’t decide. Whatever, he ain’t like nobody else.
 - There is a sort of convergence starting to happen between the computer and musical instruments, but it’s still quite a long way off.

 - Most game music is based on loops effectively.
 - One of the great breakthroughs of evolution theory is that you start with simple things and they will grow into complexity.

 - I’ve got nothing against records – I’ve spent my life making them – but they are a kind of historical blip.
 - As soon as I hear a sound, it always suggests a mood to me.
 - I think very often producers are really trying to repeat things. When they hear something in the new songs that they recognize as being a bit like something that was a success on a previous record, they’re inclined to encourage that.
 - I don’t want to do free jazz! Because free jazz – which is the musical equivalent of free marketeering – isn’t actually free at all. It’s just constrained by what your muscles can do.

 - Agressive music can only shock you once. Afterwards its impact declines. It’s inevitable.
 - Musicians are there in front of you, and the spectators sense their tension, which is not the case when you’re listening to a record. Your attention is more relaxed. The emotional aspect is more important in live music.
 - I cant duplicate my own successes, because part of the creation of that effect is making something happen that you didn’t expect.
 - For me it’s always contingent on getting a sound-the sound always suggests what kind of melody it should be. So it’s always sound first and then the line afterwards.
