 - Freedom without any purpose feels a whole lot like boredom.
 - Right now my life has an expiration date determined by my bank balance. Can I find something before my time is up?
 - I have no idea what to do with myself. And while I wait for my epiphany, I feel the toxins collecting in my body.
 - Isn’t it better to regret things you’ve done, than regret things you’ve never even tried?
 - I wondered if the Demon that whispered “Why not be free?” was Freedom itself.
