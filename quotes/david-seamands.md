 - God is not against us for our sins. God is for us against our sins.
 - We cannot change our memories, but we can change their meaning and the power they have over us.
 - We read, we hear, we believe a good theology of grace. But thatâ€™s not the way we live. The good news of the Gospel of grace has not penetrated the level of our emotions.
