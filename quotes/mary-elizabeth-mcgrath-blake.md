 - We each have all the time there is; our mental and moral status is determined by what we do with it.
 - For ’tis green, green, green, where the ruined towers are gray, And it’s green, green, green, all the happy night and day; Green of leaf and green of sod, green of ivy on the wall, And the blessed Irish shamrock with the fairest green of all.
