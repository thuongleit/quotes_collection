 - It doesn’t matter what people want to hear. It doesn’t matter if people like you. It doesn’t matter if the whole world thinks you’re crazy. It doesn’t matter whose heart you break. What matters is the truth.
 - Because this, for better or worse, is exactly where the truth lies – at the intersection of the forgotten and the ignored, in the neighborhood of all we have tried to forget.
 - I never met an addict who came from a nice home. I’ve met addicts that came from families that had money and nice houses. But never from a nice home.
