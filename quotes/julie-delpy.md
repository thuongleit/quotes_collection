 - I think it’s nice when everyone’s happy. I’m that kind of person. But then sometimes you have people that are never happy, which also happened to me a little bit, people that always find ways to complain about everything. But if they’re never happy, that’s the way they are.
 - I’m a very direct person and, sometimes, when I want something, I will push it until I get it. But, it’s OK. It’s not as bad as some people. When I have an idea in my head, I’m pretty stubborn.

 - I make these little films. I’m just a working person. I just study people a little bit more. It’s more sociological, and it’s funny anyway – not that serious. It’s not like false humility. I just take it for what it is.
 - What’s funny is that with my comedies I don’t believe they’re my best screenplays necessarily. They’re just the ones that I wrote that I knew I could get financing, you know? I believe my other films could be better, but right now they’re not being made. But they will eventually.
 - I’m comfortable wherever I am, and I can be anywhere and feel comfortable after three weeks. I adapt, and I’m like a chameleon.
