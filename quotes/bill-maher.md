 - Faith means the purposeful suspension of critical thinking. It’s nothing to be admired.

 - Ask your doctor if getting off your ass is right for you.

 - Saddam Hussein is Hitler like Oasis was The Beatles.
 - Atheism is a religion the way abstinence is a sex position.

 - Whatever good religion has done, it has come at a terrible price.
 - In ancient times they sacrificed the virgins. Men were not about to sacrifice the sluts!
 - I don’t think all life is precious. I know people say that all the time, “Life is precious.” I think some life is precious, and some life is just a waste of protoplasm. Start over.
 - Jesus, as a philosopher is wonderful. There’s no greater role model, in my view, than Jesus Christ. It’s just a shame that most of the people who follow him and call themselves Christians act nothing like him.

 - I am so tired of rearranging my life around what the stupidest people might do.
 - Community is gathering around a fire and listening to someone tell a story.
 - Sex is too easy for women to get, and too hard for men. I mean, honestly, for a man to walk into someplace and have every woman ready to take him home, he’d have to rule the world. A woman would have to do her hair.
 - The only thing I hate worse than prophecy is self-fulfilling prophecy.
 - There’s a phrase we live by in America: “In God We Trust”. It’s right there where Jesus would want it: on our money.
 - Life is not like a box of chocolates unless there’s a few turds in the box.
 - If you believe Jesus ever had a good word for war or torture or tax cuts for the rich, or raping the earth, or refusing water to dying migrants, then you might as well believe bunnies lay painted eggs.

 - I feel like I’m wearing orthopedic shoes, because I stand corrected.
 - Because of the Republicans, I’m not ashamed of being an American. I’m embarrassed!

 - When sex is good theres nothing better, when its bad its not bad.
 - Good presidents, people like George Bush, they SEND people to war. They don’t bring them a rescue. This is America. We rescue insurance companies and banks.
 - If you belonged to a political party or a social club that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny, homophobia, violence, and sheer ignorance as religion is, youd resign in protest. To do otherwise is to be an enabler – a mafia wife.
 - Abstinence is a perversion.
 - You can’t claim you’re for peace if you’re not willing to disturb it.

 - The answer isn’t another pill. The answer is spinach.
 - I know climate change is a hoax – of course – but places that have never seen this type of winter weather got hit by it. More than a half a million southerners have been left in the dark – and then the storm hit.

 - Do you want to know why marijuana is illegal? Because the drug companies want marijuana to be illegal. You see, if it came down to Prozak versus Marijuana, Prozak would lose.

 - Sarah Palin finally heard what happened in Japan and she’s demanding that we invade ‘Tsunami.’

 - The Dalai Lama visited the White House and told the President that he could teach him to find a higher state of consciousness. Then after talking to Bush for a few minutes, he said, ‘You know what? Let’s just grab lunch.’
 - People sometimes say how standup is so hard, and I always tell them that it’s hard at the beginning.

 - How can the Republicans get away with picking their Dennis Kucinich, but when – if the Democrats tried it, all hell would break lose?

 - Only cowards push a button from thousands of miles away, or tens of thousands of feet up, to kill people who can’t possibly fight back.
 - In ten Muslim countries you can get the death penalty just for being gay. If they were chopping the heads off of gay people in the Vatican, wouldn’t there be a greater outcry among liberals?
 - The true axis of evil in America is the brilliance of our marketing combined with the stupidity of our people.
 - Life is about making tough choices. Sometimes you have to go where your career is going.
 - Married men live longer. Yes. And an indoor cat also lives longer. It’s a furball with a broken spirit, that can only look out on a world it can never enjoy. But it does technically live longer.
 - Ninety percent of people support background checks. Which means even people who can’t pass a background check support background checks.
 - A lot of people say they are dyslexic; some have to realize that they are just stupid.
 - A lot of good has come from drugs. I think ‘Penny Lane’ is worth 10 dead kids. Dark Side of the Moon is worth 100 dead kids. Because a lot of kids wouldn’t even be born if it weren’t for that album, so it evens out.
 - The “Power of One” is a slogan – not a goal.
 - It’s that time of year again, April 15, taxes. I know it’s depressing, but just remember, you’re paying for roads, bridges, hospitals, and an army to keep the nation free. Unfortunately that nation is Afghanistan.
 - I mean, maybe one day we will live in a more optimum world where terrorists come in every color of the rainbow. But the truth is, now they don’t. I mean, the people who are trying to get us are young Muslim men, period.
 - I just don’t see why anybody would vote Republican in the Army. If you want to support the troops, if I was a troop, I would say, ‘You know how to support me? Don’t send me to stupid wars.’
 - New Rule: News organizations have to stop using the phrase: “We go beyond the headlines.” That’s your job, dummy. You don’t see American Airlines saying, “We land our jets on the runway”!

 - If conservatives get to call universal healthcare ‘socialized medicine,’ I get to call private, for-profit healthcare ‘soulless, vampire bastards making money off human pain.’

 - I think capital punishment works great. Every killer you kill never kills again.
 - Americans are gluttons. We shop with forklifts. We have a holiday where we stuff food into other food. Our strippers wrestle in Jell-O, where other countries have to use mud.
 - I hear this all the time: ‘Obama’s policies aren’t working.’ He hasn’t been allowed to put his policies into place.

 - I think America causes cancer, longevity is less important than fun, and young people should be discouraged from voting.

 - You know what happens when windmills collapse into the sea? A splash.

 - A new cologne is coming out. It’s for cowboys, and it’s made from cow’s manure. That way the women will be on you like flies!

 - I don’t want to be a pessimist. I’m a realist. One man’s realist is another man’s pessimist.

 - In today’s Republican Party, there’s a term for people who hate charity and love killing: ‘Christian.’

 - To all conservative women out there: If you are so sure the embryo needed for stem cell research are precious human life that can’t be destroyed, then implant one in your uterus and bring it to term. That’s right, put your cervix where your mouth is.
 - I’m guessing our soldiers are happy to be leaving Iraq. It is no fun being in a country where there’s crumbling infrastructure and an ignorant population, but they said they’re happy to come home anyway.
 - The cable TV sex channels don’t expand our horizons, don’t make us better people, and don’t come in clearly enough.
 - To me a real patriot is like a real friend. Who’s your real friend? It’s the person who tells you the truth. That’s who my real friends are. So, you know, I think as far as our country goes, we need more people who will do that.
 - The only way for mankind to survive is for religion to die.
 - We don’t like mystery. You like mystery, ’cause it’s not a mystery to you; you know when you’re gonna get laid.

 - Saying someone is religious is heard in most of America as a compliment, a reassuring affirmation that someone will be moral, ethical, and after a few glasses of wine, a freak in the bedroom.
 - Russia has banned all adoptions to Americans. So, if you were hoping to get a little white kid with fetal alcohol syndrome, you’re going to have to wait until Lindsay Lohan reproduces.
 - Republicans stand by their convictions. Stupid, ignorant, world-destroying convictions based on disproven economic fantasies and ancient books full of primitive morality and magic people. But convictions, nonetheless.
 - During the Depression, or back when we were fighting Hitler, people didn’t have time to sue a company if the coffee was too hot. There were urgent, pressing problems. If you think you have it tough, read history books.

 - There are people who think everything is a conspiracy and I think they’re crazy.
 - Heroin may be bad, but it sure as hell hasn’t hurt my CD collection.
 - Many people can’t deal with unanswered questions, which religion exploits by providing answers, even if they are just made up by someone. This is also why we love TV shows and movies that neatly wrap up everything in exactly an hour or two.
 - I thought this election was an adult discussion on how best to protect ourselves in the face of terrorism, but apparently it was a referendum on boys kissing. When homophobia trumps terrorism in America, wow. This country needs to get laid.

 - New Rule: Someone must x-ray my stomach to see if the Peeps I ate on Easter are still in there, intact and completely undigested. And I’m not talking about this past Easter. I’m talking about the last time I celebrated Easter, in 1962.

 - First they didn’t believe in evolution. Then they didn’t believe in global warming. Now the debt ceiling. What I call ‘the moron trifecta.’
 - New rule: If churches don’t have to pay taxes, they also can’t call the fire department when they catch fire. Sorry reverend, that’s one of those services that goes along with paying in. I’ll use the fire department I pay for. You can pray for rain.
 - The difference, I think, that matters is which of the religions are dangerous. They’re all crazy, but which ones have the potential to turn that into death. In that area, I think we have to worry the most about the Muslims and the Christians.

 - New Rule: The people of America who were most in favor of the Iraq War must now go there and fight it.
 - Remember, guns don’t kill people – unless you practice real hard.

 - I believe in God, I just give him more credit than being a single parent and an author.

 - Democrats are afraid of polls. Republicans aren’t afraid of polls. Republicans make polls. Democrats run from polls.
 - My thinking is, government is really there to do the things that people absolutely can’t do for themselves. And that’s mostly involved with the things that might kill you. And what might kill me? The environment and terrorism.
 - White people have always shown their superiority over blacks with their feet, moving out of black neighborhoods with the fear that their kids will turn into one of them. And now, through the magic of MTV, damned if it didn’t turn out that way!

 - Today Obama was seen leaving the White House in a nurse’s uniform on a flight to Cuba to smother Castro with a pillow.
 - I can’t stay mad at Pope Frank. I just can’t. It’s a funny situation that I like the pope and Mel Gibson doesn’t.

 - Time magazine put Chris Christie on the cover with the caption, ‘The Elephant in the Room.’ And People magazine named him ‘Sexiest Garbage Truck in a Suit.’
 - The rebel army in Libya is just like 1,000 guys in Toyota trucks. The world is asking the question; can 1000 anti-government guys in pick-up trucks with small arms, take over a country of millions? To which I say, ask the Teabaggers.
 - As a loyal American and I think a patriotic American, no, I don’t want Sarah Palin to be president.
 - I think flying planes into a building was a faith-based initiative. I think religion is a neurological disorder.
 - I would describe my spirituality as exactly the opposite of having a religious affiliation.
