 - The Earth is the cradle of Humanity. But one doesn’t always live in the cradle.
 - First, inevitably, the idea, the fantasy, the fairy tale. Then, scientific calculation. Ultimately, fulfillment crowns the dream.
 - Man will not always stay on Earth; the pursuit of light and space will lead him to penetrate the bounds of the atmosphere, timidly at first, but in the end to conquer the whole of solar space.
 - Man must at all costs overcome the Earth’s gravity and have, in reserve, the space at least of the Solar System.
 - All our knowledge – past, present, and future – is nothing compared to what we will never know.
