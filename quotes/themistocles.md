 - I cannot fiddle, but I can make a great state from a little city.
 - I choose the likely man in preference to the rich man; I want a man without money rather than money without a man.
 - The Athenians govern the Greeks; I govern the Athenians; you, my wife, govern me; your son governs you.
 - May I never sit on a tribunal where my friends shall not find more favor from me than strangers.
 - Strike, if you will, but listen.
 - I have with me two gods, Persuasion and Compulsion.
