 - I hate storms, but calms undermine my spirits.
 - You do not ask a tame seagull why it needs to disappear from time to time toward the open sea. It goes, that’s all.
 - The questions that used to bother me at times, do not weigh anything before the immensity of a wake so close to the sky and filled with the wind of the sea.
 - My real log is written in the sea and sky; the sails talking with the rain and the stars amid the sounds of the sea, the silences full of secret things between my boat and me, like the times I spent as a child listening to the forest talk.
 - A sailor’s joys are as simple as a child’s.
