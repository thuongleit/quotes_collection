 - The truth will come out in the end.
 - I hope that the truth shall eventually give me back my freedom.
 - My detention has been worth every second if only to prove my innocence to those who truly matter most my countrymen.
 - Iâ€™m convinced I will be cleared of all these charges that were unfairly leveled against me.
