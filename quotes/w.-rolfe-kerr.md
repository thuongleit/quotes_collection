 - Do not fear mistakes – fear only the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to those mistakes.
 - I pray that we will treat each and every one of our Heavenly Father’s children lovingly, tenderly, and individually, as He would have us treat them. I also pray that we will always be mindful of the power each one of us has to make a difference and to influence the world in which we live.
