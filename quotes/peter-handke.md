 - If a nation loses its storytellers, it loses its childhood.
 - When the child was a child, it didn’t know that it was a child, everything was soulful, and all souls were one.
 - I couldn’t say who I am, I haven’t the remotest notion of myself; I am someone without antecedents, without a history, without a country, and on that I insist!
 - No one can be trusted who isn’t thrilled with himself at least now and then.
