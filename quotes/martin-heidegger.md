 - To dwell is to garden.
 - Only if we are capable of dwelling, only then can we build.
 - What seems natural to us is probably just something familiar in a long tradition that has forgotten the unfamiliar source from which it arose. And yet this unfamiliar source once struck man as strange and caused him to think and to wonder.

 - In Nietzsche’s view nihilism is not a Weltanschauung that occurs at some time and place or another; it is rather the basic character of what happens in Occidental history.

 - Is the earth in our head? Or do we stand on the earth?
 - I know that everything essential and great originated from the fact that the human being had a homeland and was rooted in tradition.
 - In no way can it be uttered, as can other things, which one can learn. Rather, from out of a full, co-existential dwelling with the thing itself – as when a spark, leaping from the fire, flares into light – so it happens, suddenly, in the soul, there to grow, alone with itself.
