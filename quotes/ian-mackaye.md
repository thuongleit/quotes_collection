 - It doesn’t hurt me on a personal level, but it hurts me on a larger level of like, why are people so stupid? Why do we have to go through these unnecessary exercises. Fight crime, don’t fight me. If you really want to make a difference don’t fight me or Fugazi.
 - If You Want To Rebel Against Society, Don’t Dull The Blade.
 - To me, music is no joke and it’s not for sale.
 - Bars are meeting places and places to unwind. But at some point, what is culture unwinding from, and why can’t they meet anywhere else?
 - I just have work to do; I just do it.
 - The archiving industry, much like the funeral industry and the wedding industry, these industries can be very exploitative.
 - The amount of money that people spend on saving stuff, they try to feed you this idea that’s it’s more important.
 - It makes me sad, the way human beings talk smack. It’s why I don’t like irony. People are too gleeful to put some teeth into something.
 - An unlocked door means that, occasionally, you might get a devil come in, but a locked door means you have thousands of angels just walk by.
 - I do feel like I have always, in my life, been inclined to be on the outside, walk a different path or something. Because of that, and increasingly over the years, my sense of distance from mainstream society or from the way culture works, I have a different kind of perception of it.
 - We had punks literally protesting Fugazi. I respect a boycott. I respect a conscionable boycott, but of all bands to boycott? Fight crime. If you really want to get out there, go fight crime.
 - I do remember seeing Godspell or Jesus Christ Superstar, one of those. It was a liberation theology venue. Anything radical seemed to be accepted there. I definitely picked up the idea there that you should question authority.

 - There’s also a lot of skateboard stuff, because I was a skateboarder. Somewhere around here I have one of my original boards.
 - Minor Threat was an important band, believe me that it was important it in my life, but it belongs to an era that no longer exists. I’m not nostalgic. I think music today is much more important, because something can be done about it.

 - What does bother me is that I have to spend time and energy dealing with the ramifications of what people do think about me.
 - Archiving is extremely expensive and time consuming. I’m sure an archivist would tell me I’m doing it wrong. It’s an industry that’s built upon essential ideas, and some of those practices are abusive.
 - I don’t think it’s an ethical or moral issue, or even that people are stupid, but I do feel like as a culture things are out of balance, perverted, and inverted. Things that are ridiculous are worshipped, and things that are important are ridiculed. I think that’s something worth thinking about.
 - I have stuff from 1979, 1980 in my collection. But I also have things from 2012. So I don’t know if it’s memorabilia as much as it is holding on to things that I find relevant that most people might not.

 - I stand behind all the lyrics I’ve ever written; I don’t have a problem with that.
 - I mean, why do people fight over sports? Because of the framework, the schematic of sports, those particular people seize upon these opportunities to be violent. And the number one problem using the same framework would be religion.
 - As hard as you try and create narratives about sports, once the ball is in the air, there’s not a damn thing you can do about it, it’s just very real.
 - I do not consider myself a teddybear. Just to be clear, I don’t feel sorry for myself.
 - I work so I don’t need to make rent through my songs, and I think if more people engaged with music without needing it to provide for their welfare, you’re not beholden to anyone.
 - My focus is always on the day. What I’ve done behind me, I try to have respect for it, and keep an eye on it, and make sure it isn’t abused, and obviously be thoughtful about it, because it’s all real to me. I’m basically in every band I ever was in, and the songs, I still mean them all.
 - Part of the way the work world works is not so much creating a separation between your work and your free time, but creating the illusion of a separation between your work and your free time. Every day is the weekend for me, which means I’m always busy.

 - It’s so interesting that humanity has to be defined by emotional strife or something. I don’t buy into that.

 - It’s just hard to have a nuanced discussion with like a thousand people, 30 of which are white-power skinheads.

 - I’m really anti-option, so computers have been my nightmare with recording. I don’t want endless tracks; I want less tracks. I want decisions to be made.
 - I’m always happy when I hear about people selling records or selling books or selling movies. It makes me proud of them.
 - I have other projects to do. I try not to let that documentation interfere with my present day.

 - The first time I ever recorded, which was into my boom-box, I was like, ‘Wow, check that out.’ It sounded great. The narcotic of it was so intense – it was pleasurable. I was like, ‘You sound like a band.’ Then I ended up spending the rest of my life trying to chase that initial high again.

 - My humor is very dry. To me it doesn’t make sense.
 - I’ve had people call me from bands that are very popular, and they’re like, ‘What do we do? We want to do what you do.’ It’s almost impossible to do what I do, because you would have to start in 1980. You can’t just do it.
 - I think about Dischord. There’s been a pretty consistent notion that Dischord have been some sort of “overlords” of the scene. Some people have felt ’they are too cool for us, or they won’t put this out, etc. All we’re doing is our own work, our own thing. That’s all we’ve ever done. Our work.
 - I never, ever had it in my mind that I wanted to be in the record industry, because I still contend that the record industry is an insidious affair. It’s this terrible collision between art and commerce, and it will always be that way.
 - Getting your letters or pictures digitized. I don’t think it’s that important. The more you spend on your materials, you’re given the sense that those things are more important due to the total amount spent. You’d probably be better off giving that money to a soup kitchen.
 - Major labels didn’t start showing up really until they smelled money, and that’s all they’re ever going to be attracted to is money-that’s the business they’re in- making money.

 - The only thing that drives music is the people who are making it.
 - I wouldn’t characterize it as an 80s nostalgia thing. For me, at least. The Corcoran show was actually almost a reportage. The exhibit was, in many ways, pretty unique. It was one of the first pieces about DC culture that doesn’t include some marble building or the Kennedy Center.

 - I’m not a sports dude, but I’m interested in the sociological implications of it.
