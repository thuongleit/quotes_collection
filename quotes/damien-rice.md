 - It’s not hard to grow when you know that you just don’t know.
 - Love tought me to cry. So come on courage, teach me to be shy.

 - For me, the more I live, the more I need to write. The more I push myself to really live and really experience things and step outside of my comfort zone, the more the songs are allowed to flow.
