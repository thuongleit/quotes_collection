 - I’ve got this terrible hernia. People think it’s a fat gut, but it’s not.
 - Winning is something you’ve dreamed about and hoped for, so that when you get there it’s no big deal. But if you lose you’re gutted, and the gutted sense just goes on, and I know what that’s like, because I’ve been having that gutted feeling since 1979.

 - Since puberty I’ve always had this strange awareness that all the keener experiences I would have in my life would happen later than it would to my contemporaries. When it came to the career thing, I never worried about it. It’s better if you’re still peaking when you’re 60, which I feel I am.
 - I’ve always turned down stuff where you had to be fat. I may be fat, but that’s not why you play a role. If the guy has to be that way, I say get somebody else because I’m not doing any fat acting.

 - When I see David Attenborough talking about how chimps live, big apes, I just remember my dad and the way he’d look at you. He couldn’t speak, but everything else about him was, ‘This is us, a family.’ Relationships are just as intense as they are for people who can speak. Probably more so.
