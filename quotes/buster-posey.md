 - Let’s get back to work and make another run at it!
 - I just try to go out and play as hard as I can and let the results take care of themselves.
 - When you struggle, you’re going to be a little discouraged. But I never felt like I was overmatched.
 - I’m just playing ball. Trying not to think about it too much.
