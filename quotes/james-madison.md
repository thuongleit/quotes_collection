 - A dependence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control on the government; but experience has taught mankind the necessity of auxiliary precautions.
 - Landholders ought to have a share in the government to support these invaluable interests and check the other many. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.

 - The religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate.
 - The ultimate authority resides in the people, and that if the federal government got too powerful and overstepped its authority, then the people would develop plans of resistance and resort to arms.
 - It is vain to say that enlightened statesmen will always be able to adjust their interests. Enlightened men will not always be at the helm.
 - Armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few.
 - It is a melancholy reflection that liberty should be equally exposed to danger whether the government have too much power or too little power and that the line which divides these extremes should be so inaccurately defined by experience.
 - Had every Athenian citizen been a Socrates, every Athenian assembly would still have been a mob.
 - Disarm the people- that is the best and most effective way to enslave them.
 - The belief in a God All Powerful wise and good, is so essential to the moral order of the world and to the happiness of man, that arguments which enforce it cannot be drawn from too many sources nor adapted with too much solicitude to the different characters and capacities impressed with it.
 - Bills of attainder, ex-post facto laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation.

 - Liberty is to faction what air is to fire...
 - It is a principle incorporated into the settled policy of America, that as peace is better than war, war is better than tribute.
 - Toleration is not the opposite of intolerance, but is the counterfeit of it. Both are despotisms. The one assumes to itself the right of withholding liberty of conscience, the other of granting it.

 - The express authority of the people alone could give validity to the Constitution.
 - Union of religious sentiments begets a surprising confidence, and ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption; all of which facilitate the execution of mischievous projects.
 - The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, selfappointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.
 - Nothing could be more irrational than to give the people power, and to withhold from them information without which power is abused.

 - Having outlived so many of my contemporaries, I ought not to forget that I may be thought to have outlived myself.
 - The constitution supposes, what the History of all Governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it.
 - Of all the enemies of public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other.
 - It is to the press mankind are indebted for having dispelled the clouds which so long encompassed religion, for disclosing her genuine lustre, and disseminating her salutary doctrines.
 - I believe there are more instances of the abridgment of the freedom of the people by gradual and silent encroachments of those in power than by violent and sudden usurpations.
 - Temporary deviations from fundamental principles are always more or less dangerous. When the first pretext fails, those who become interested in prolonging the evil will rarely be at a loss for other pretexts.
 - The means of defence agst. foreign danger, have been always the instruments of tyranny at home.
 - Experience has instructed us that no skill in the science of government has yet been able to discriminate and define, with sufficient certainty, its three great provinces the legislative, executive, and judiciary; or even the privileges and powers of the different legislative branches.

 - We have seen that the tendency of republican governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people, therefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary departments.
 - Is there a Legislative power in fact, not expressly prohibited by the Constitution, which might not, according to the doctrine of the Court, be exercised as a means of carrying into effect some specified Power?

 - In framing a system, which we wish to last for ages, we should not lose sight of the changes which ages will produce.
 - The Federal Constitution forms a happy combination in this respect; the great and aggregate interests being referred to the national, the local and particular, to the state legislatures.
 - The characters and events depicted in the damn bible are fictitious. Any similarity to actual persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

 - I cannot undertake to lay my finger on that article of the Constitution which granted a right to Congress of expending, on objects of benevolence, the money of their constituents.
 - You give me a credit to which I have no claim in calling me “the writer of the Constitution of the United States.” This was not, like the fabled Goddess of Wisdom, the offspring of a single brain. It ought to be regarded as the work of many heads and many hands.
 - A government resting on the minority is an aristocracy, not a Republic, and could not be safe with a numerical and physical force against it, without a standing army, an enslaved press and a disarmed populace.
 - Do not separate text from historical background. If you do, you will have perverted and subverted the Constitution, which can only end in a distorted, bastardized form of illegitimate government.
 - The advice nearest to my heart and deepest in my convictions is that the Union of the States be cherished and perpetuated.
 - The real difference of interests, lay not between large and small, but between the Northern and Southern states. The institution of slavery and its consequences formed a line of discrimination.
 - We’ve staked our future on our ability to follow the Ten Commandments with all our heart.
 - In Republics, the great danger is, that the majority may not sufficiently respect the rights of the minority.
 - Man is known to be a selfish, as well as a social being.

 - The magnitude of this evil among us is so deeply felt, and so universally acknowledged, that no merit could be greater than that of devising a satisfactory remedy for it.
 - Enlightened statesmen will not always be at the helm.
 - If man is not fit to govern himself, how can he be fit to govern someone else?
 - Extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have common motive to invade the rights of other citizens.

 - Where a majority are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of the minor party become insecure.
 - If we advert to the nature of republican government, we shall find that the censorial power is in the people over the government, and not in the government over the people.
 - Every man who loves peace, every man who loves his country, every man who loves liberty ought to have it ever before his eyes that he may cherish in his heart a due attachment to the Union of America and be able to set a due value on the means of preserving it.
 - A good government implies two things: first, fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained.
 - There never was an assembly of men, charged with a great and arduous trust, who were more pure in their motives, or more exclusively or anxiously devoted to the object committed to them.

 - All power in human hands is liable to be abused.
 - Each State, in ratifying the Constitution, is considered as a sovereign body, independent of all others, and only to be bound by its own voluntary act. In this relation, then, the new Constitution will, if established, be a FEDERAL, and not a NATIONAL constitution.

 - The security intended to the general liberty consists in the frequent election and in the rotation of the members of Congress.
 - I entirely concur in the propriety of resorting to the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the nation. In that sense alone it is the legitimate Constitution. And if that is not the guide in expounding it, there may be no security.
 - The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venal love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace.
 - The means of defence against foreign danger have been always the instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe, the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the people.
 - The definition of the right of suffrage is very justly regarded as a fundamental article of republican government.
 - To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.
 - A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect and promises the cure for which we are seeking.
 - It is a misfortune incident to republican government, though in a less degree than to other governments, that those who administer it, may forget their obligations to their constituents, and prove unfaithful to their important trust.
 - A watchful eye must be kept on ourselves lest while we are building ideal monuments of Renown and Bliss here we neglect to have our names enrolled in the Annals of Heaven.
 - Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.
 - In the extent and proper structure of the Union, therefore, we behold a republican remedy for the disease incident to republican government.
 - America united with a handful of troops, or without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand veterans ready for combat.
 - Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected. No man is safe in his opinions, his person, his faculties, or his possessions.
 - But the mild voice of reason, pleading the cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain.
 - The inference to which we are brought is that the causes of faction cannot be removed and that relief is only to be sought in the means of controlling its effects.
 - Democracy was the right of the people to choose their own tyrant.
 - Each generation should be made to bear the burden of its own wars, instead of carrying them on, at the expense of other generations.

 - Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
 - The right of the citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the state shall not be questioned.
 - The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite.
 - There is no maxim, in my opinion, which is more liable to be misapplied, and which, therefore, more needs elucidation, than the current one, that the interest of the majority is the political standard of right and wrong.
 - An efficient militia is authorized and contemplated by the Constitution and required by the spirit and safety of free government.
 - This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land.
 - The powers of the federal government are enumerated; it can only operate in certain cases; it has legislative powers on defined and limited objects, beyond which it cannot extend its jurisdiction.
 - It was by the sober sense of our citizens that we were safely and steadily conducted from monarchy to republicanism, and it is by the same agency alone we can be kept from falling back.
 - A just government has no need for the clergy or the church.
 - The operations of the federal government will be most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State governments, in times of peace and security.
 - Government destitute of energy, will ever produce anarchy.
 - A people armed and free, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition and is a bulwark for the nation against foreign invasion and domestic oppression.
 - That is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest.
 - Respect for character is always diminished in proportion to the number among whom the blame or praise is to be divided.
 - The legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex.
 - Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise, every expanded prospect.
 - I go on the principle that a public debt is a public curse and in a republican government more than in any other.
 - This policy of supplying by opposite and rival interests, the defect of better motives, might be traced through the whole system of human affairs, both private and public.
 - From the the protection of different and unequal faculties of acquiring property, the possession of different degrees and kinds of property immediately results.
 - The purpose of separation of church and state is to keep forever from these shores the ceaseless strife that has soaked the soil of Europe with blood for centuries.
 - As to the permanent interest of individuals in the aggregated interests of the community, and in the proverbial maxim, that honesty is the best policy, present temptation is often found to be an overmatch for those considerations.
 - It has been said that all Government is an evil. It would be more proper to say that the necessity of any Government is a misfortune. This necessity however exists; and the problem to be solved is, not what form of Government is perfect, but which of the forms is least imperfect.
 - What spectacle can be more edifying or more seasonable, than that of Liberty and Learning, each leaning on the other for their mutual and surest support?
 - We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man’s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance.
 - Strongly guarded as is the separation between Religion and Government in the Constitution of the United States, the danger of encroachment by Ecclesiastical Bodies may be illustrated by precedents already furnished in their short history.
 - The problem to be solved is, not what form of government is perfect, but which of the forms is least imperfect.
 - Were it possible so to accelerate the intercourse between every part of the globe that all its inhabitants could be united under the superintending authority of an ecumenical Council, how great a portion of human evils would be avoided.
 - Popular liberty might then have escaped the indelible reproach of decreeing to the same citizens, the hemlock on one day, and statues on the next.
 - Justice is the end of government. It is the end of civil society. It ever has been and ever will be pursued until it be obtained, or until liberty be lost in the pursuit.
 - The rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted.
 - In a society under the forms of which the stronger faction can readily unite and oppress the weaker, anarchy may as truly be said to reign as in a state of nature.
 - The most common and durable source of faction has been the various and unequal distribution of property.
 - It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain; because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations of power, every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and multiplied repetitions.
 - Among the numerous advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of faction.
 - Our country, if it does justice to itself, will be the workshop of liberty to the civilized world.
 - Another advantage accruing from this ingredient in the constitution of a senate, is the additional impediment it must prove against improper acts of legislation. No law or resolution can now be passed without the concurrence first of a majority of the people, and then of a majority of the states.
 - Thus the right of nullification meant by Mr. Jefferson is the natural right, which all admit to be a remedy against insupportable oppression.
 - We have staked the whole future of our new nation, not upon the power of government; far from it. We have staked the future of all our political constitutions upon the capacity of each of ourselves to govern ourselves according to the moral principles of the Ten Commandments.
 - A bad cause seldom fails to betray itself.
 - Stability in government is essential to national character and to the advantages annexed to it, as well as to that repose and confidence in the minds of the people, which are among the chief blessings of civil society.
 - It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good, the real welfare of the great body of the people, is the supreme object to be pursued; and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object.
 - Wherever there is interest and power to do wrong, wrong will generally be done.
 - In time of actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of War, has the same tendency to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty.

 - Congress shall never disarm any citizen unless such as are or have been in actual rebellion.
 - The power of taxing people and their property is essential to the very existence of government.

 - Outlets for the freed blacks are alone wanted for the erasure of the blot from our Republican character.
 - One nation is to another what one individual is to another; with this melancholy distinction perhaps, that the former with fewer of the benevolent emotions than the latter, are under fewer restraints also from taking undue advantage of the indiscretions of each other.
 - In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.

 - I should not regret a fair and full trial of the entire abolition of capital punishment.
 - It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society.
 - Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything.
 - If the public homage of a people can ever be worthy of the favorable regard of the Holy and Omniscient Being to Whom it is addressed, it must be that in which those who join in it are guided only be their free choice-by the impulse of their hearts and the dictates of their consciences...
 - The President is responsible to the public for the conduct of the person he has nominated and appointed.
 - For what purpose could the enumeration of particular powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be included in the preceding general power?
 - The invasion of private rights is chiefly to be apprehended, not from acts of Government contrary to the sense of its constituents, but from acts in which the Government is the mere instrument of the major number of the Constituents.
 - The most that the Convention could do in such a situation, was to avoid the errors suggested by the past experience of other countries, as well as of our own; and to provide a convenient mode of rectifying their own errors, as future experience may unfold them.
 - War should only be declared by the authority of the people, whose toils and treasures are to support its burdens, instead of the government which is to reap its fruits.
 - The latent causes of faction are thus sown in the nature of man.
 - In suits at common law, trial by jury in civil cases is as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existent rights of nature.
 - The people shall not be restrained from peacefully assembling and consulting for their common good, nor from applying to the legislature by petitions, or remonstrances for redress of their grievances.
 - Despotism can only exist in darkness, and there are too many lights now in the political firmament to permit it to remain anywhere, as it has heretofore done, almost everywhere.
 - It is to be the assent and ratification of the several States, derived from the supreme authority in each State, the authority of the people themselves. The act, therefore establishing the Constitution, will not be a NATIONAL, but a FEDERAL act.
 - Freedom arises from a multiplicity of sects, which pervades America, and is the best and only security for religious liberty in America.
 - War contains so much folly, as well as wickedness, that much is to be hoped from the progress of reason.
 - Government is instituted to protect property of every sort; as well that which lies in the various rights of individuals, as that which the term particularly expresses. This being the end of government, that alone is a just government which impartially secures to every man whatever is his own.
 - The eyes of the world being thus on our Country, it is put the more on its good behavior, and under the greater obligation also, to do justice to the Tree of Liberty by an exhibition of the fine fruits we gather from it.
 - Union of religious sentiments begets a surprising confidence.
 - No free country has ever been without Parties, which are a natural offspring of freedom.
 - The diversity in the faculties of men, from which the rights of property originate, is not less an insuperable obstacle to an uniformity of interests. The protection of these faculties is the first object of government.
 - It is sufficiently obvious, that persons and property are the two great subjects on which Governments are to act; and that the rights of persons, and the rights of property, are the objects, for the protection of which Government was instituted. These rights cannot well be separated.
 - How a regulation so unjust in itself, so foreign to the authority of Congress, and so hurtful to the sale of public land, and smelling so strongly of an antiquated bigotry, could have received the countenance of a committee is truly a matter of astonishment.
 - It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be in its present form from the Inquisition, it differs from it only in degree.
 - We are right to take alarm at the first experiment upon our liberties.
 - The executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.
 - What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. If angels were to govern men, neither external nor internal controls on government would be necessary.

 - I have ever regarded the freedom of religious opinions and worship as equally belonging to every sect.
 - Democracies have been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their death.
 - There is not a more important and fundamental principle in legislation, than that the ways and means ought always to face the public engagements; that our appropriations should ever go hand in hand with our promises.
 - When men exercise their reason coolly and freely, on a variety of distinct questions, they inevitably fall into different opinions, on some of them. When they are governed by a common passion, their opinions if they are so to be called, will be the same.
 - Public opinion sets bounds to every government, and is the real sovereign in every free one.
 - The personal right to acquire property, which is a natural right, gives to property, when acquired, a right to protection, as a social right.

 - Among the features peculiar to the political system of the United States, is the perfect equality of rights which it secures to every religious sect.

 - There is a degree of depravity in mankind which requires a certain degree of circumspection and distrust.
 - As a man is said to have a right to his property, he may be equally said to have a property in his rights.
 - To provide employment for the poor, and support for the indigent, is among the primary, and, at the same time, not least difficult cares of the public authority.
 - Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Every citizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem and confidence of his country.
 - Wherever the real power in a Government lies, there is the danger of oppression.
 - The government of the United States is a definite government, confined to specified objects. It is not like the state governments, whose powers are more general. Charity is no part of the legislative duty of the government.
 - Ecclesiastical establishments tend to great ignorance and corruption.
 - I have no doubt but that the misery of the lower classes will be found to abate whenever the Government assumes a freer aspect and the laws favor a subdivision of Property.
 - Our Constitution represents the work of the finger of Almighty God.
 - The danger from legislative usurpations, which, by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations.
 - It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood.
 - A just security to property is not afforded by that government, under which unequal taxes oppress one species of property and reward another species.
 - No man can be a competent legislator who does not add to an upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of knowledge of the subject on which he is to legislate.
 - Nor is any evidence to be found, either in History or Human Nature, that nations are to be bribed out of a spirit of encroachment and aggression, by humiliations which nourish their pride, or by concessions that extend their resources and power.
 - It would have marked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own experience would have rendered inexcusable.
 - The rights of man as the foundation of just Government had been long understood but the superstructures projected had been sadly defective.
 - Despotism can only exist in darkness.
 - What is government itself but the greatest of all reflections on human nature?
 - The political truths declared in that solemn manner acquire by degrees the character of fundamental maxims of free Government, and as they become incorporated with national sentiment, counteract the impulses of interest and passion.
 - It is possible that these may all be insufficient to control the caprice and wickedness of man. But are they not all that government will admit, and all that human prudence can devise?
 - No distinction seems to be more obvious than that between spiritual and temporal matters. Yet whenever they have been made objects of Legislation, they have clashed and contended with each other, till one or the other has gained the supremacy.
 - If we are to take for the criterion of truth the majority of suffrages, they ought to be gotten from those philosophic and patriotic citizens who cultivate their reason.
