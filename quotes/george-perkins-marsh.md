 - The great question, whether man is of nature or above her.
 - Man has too long forgotten that the earth was given to him for usufruct alone, not for consumption, still less for profligate waste.
 - The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve, and we can never know how wide a circle of disturbance we produce in the harmonies of nature when we throw the smallest pebble into the ocean of organic life.
 - Sight is a faculty; seeing is an art.
 - All Nature is linked together by invisible bonds and every organic creature, however low, however feeble, however dependent, is necessary to the well-being of some other among the myriad forms of life.
 - Man is everywhere a disturbing agent. Wherever he plants his foot, the harmonies of nature are turned to discords.
 - The improvement of forest trees is the work of centuries. So much more the reason for beginning now.
 - Wherever modern Science has exploded a superstitious fable or even a picturesque error, she has replaced it with a grander and even more poetical truth.
