 - God often uses a man or several different men to impact your life with the anointing of the Holy Spirit.
 - Those who refuse to change and to modify are refusing to be recipients of the anointing.
 - The Holy Spirit has a sanctifying influence. The influence of the Holy Spirit tends towards sanctification, purity and holiness. Expect to live a life of greater purity, sanctification and holiness when under the sweet influence of the Holy Spirit.
