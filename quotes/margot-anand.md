 - You stand exactly in the middle, poised between heaven and earth, a human conductor for the energy that seeks to flow between these two polarities.
 - You have the power to make manifest that which is not yet visible, to create that which is still unborn.
 - When you are ecstatic and in love, you feel buoyant, you feel life, you feel like you are dancing in the sky.
