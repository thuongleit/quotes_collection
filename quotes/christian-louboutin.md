 - I like to see people who are survivors wearing my shoes. I am fascinated by people who can bounce back.
 - A shoe is not only a design, but it’s a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you’re going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.

 - Istanbul is inspiring because it has its own code of architecture, literature, poetry, music.
 - People are proud of their tattoos. It’s like a modern coat of arms.
 - People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don’t want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable. I try to make high heels as comfortable as they can be, but my priority is design, beauty and sexiness. I’m not against them, but comfort is not my focus.
 - High heels are pleasure with pain.
 - Shoes are just a pedestal. What interests me is the power of the woman who wears them.

 - Men are like bulls. They cannot resist the red sole.

 - Don’t reject a shoe because you can’t run in it. It’s OK not to run.

 - I mean, the shoe – there is a music to it, there is attitude, there is sound, it’s a movement. Clothes – it’s a different story. There are a million things I’d rather do before designing clothes: directing, landscaping.

 - You need to believe in yourself and what you do. Be tenacious and genuine.
 - A naked woman in heels is a beautiful thing. A naked man in shoes looks like a fool.

 - To feel like a woman, wear heels, to feel like a goddess, wear five inches.

 - When a woman buys shoes, she takes them out of the box and looks at herself in the mirror. But she isn’t really looking at her shoes – she’s looking at herself. If she likes herself, then she likes the shoes.
 - I would hate for someone to look at my shoes and say, ‘Oh my God! That looks so comfortable!’
 - Everyone has their dates. For me, it’s 1991. I can place every memory of my life either before or after this date. It’s the year I became an adult. My mother died, and I created my company shortly thereafter. I definitely would not have done it if she hadn’t passed away.
 - My drawing for women is really curvy. My drawings for men are actually quite angular.
 - Cinderella is not only an iconic character when it comes to beauty, grace and fairytale love, but also shoes.
 - I hate the whole concept of the clog! It’s fake, it’s ugly, and it’s not even comfortable!
 - I really have not so much sympathy. If Tina Turner and Prince’s back-up band can perform on stage in them for three hours, you can’t tell me they are impossible to walk in. High heels are pleasure with pain. If you can’t walk in them, don’t wear them.
 - I wanted to be a shoe designer, but I never thought it could be a profession. But what was the alternative? Doctor? Too dirty! Air-hostess? Maybe not! Then someone gave me a book on Roger Vivier, and, cheri, instantly I knew that was it!
 - I guess being French, I love Hollywood. I love Hollywood movies. Joseph Mankiewicz’s ‘All About Eve.’ ‘Mildred Pierce.’

 - I wanted to create something that broke rules and made women feel confident and empowered.
 - I remain faithful to bourbon sour. It’s absolutely delicious. You’d have to ask a bartender what’s in it, but I think if you know you might never have a drink. I also love a little rum, 7 years aged, brown, when it is chilly, before dinner.
 - For women raised in the ’70s, high heels can still carry a stigma; they’re associated with being stupid, with just wanting to please a man. Other women find them empowering.
 - You know, I’m behind my company. My company has been a big part of my life. And it’s not that I been buying a company or that my father bought a company and tried to do something out of it. You know, it’s not the same thing. It’s my name, it’s my company, it’s my signature.
 - Boredom is a concept that I don’t understand.
 - A good pump is a silhouette, like the bone structure of the face. It’s like a beautiful face with no make-up. You can cover a not-so-beautiful face with make-up, but it is just a mask – it is the same with shoes.
 - I always loved fish for the colors and birds for the plumage. In the same way, I loved those women of the cabaret. They were birds of paradise.
 - People tend to fear the ghosts in their own family. You feel these family curses and think, ‘If it happened to my father, it could happen to me.’

 - My relationship with shoes has always been linked to shoes, women, women in their shoes and performance.
 - I never wanted to design clothes. I never wanted to work for the fashion industry. Shoes sort of belong to the fashion industry, which is why I’m part of the fashion industry. But that’s never been my thought. My thought since I was a child was really to design those shoes for girls on stage.

 - The most outrageous shoe that I had to do was a shoe where the person gave me stones – precious stones – and say that I could do anything with precious stones.

 - I don’t like conflicts. I’m not a competitive person at heart. To be in the middle of turmoil is boring.
 - I never had the dream to be a great designer. My focus was just to do beautiful things.
 - If you are not bored by life, and your primary motto is enthusiasm and if you like your friends, family around you, it all translates into your designs. That’s what keeps the creativity alive.
 - I’m always taking into consideration how the shoe will look on the foot, its relation to the ankle and the leg – that’s very important. I often see shoes that seem interesting or nice until a woman puts them on. then a lot of shoes look very clunky, and nobody likes to see that.
 - Even today, I am still very child-like while designing. It’s a bit like Christmas – each of your designs you create is like unravelling your presents.
 - One thing I detest, I have to say, is when a shoe is too soft, and it’s molding to the foot. This is quite disgusting. And I really, really hate incredibly long shoes, where the last is very pointy, almost like Aladdin.
 - There’s nothing I liked visually of the period I was a child. There was no dream in it, and nothing sparkled.
 - I listen to my stomach. It tells me when I am starving.
 - These heels are candy for the feet; they’re for pleasure, not practicality.
 - I never had a plan. I have to say, I’m very shocked when people start a company and say, ‘In five years I want to launch a perfume, or in 10 years I want to have this.’ How can you know?
 - Funnily enough, the most difficult style to do is the plain pump because it needs to look good on a variety of feet. I compare it to having a good bone structure. Make-up will make you look good, but it helps if you have a good skeleton to begin with.

 - My favorite sound is definitely mules. If it was an instrument, it’s really pingthe touch of the black keys of the piano.
 - I hate the idea of natural. For example, I prefer gardens to wild nature. I like to see the human touch. High heels are a complete invention – an extravagance.

 - Be completely true to yourself and you’ll be happy.

 - I am very bad at drawing. Seriously. I can draw shoes. That’s about it.
 - The thing I always try to remember is that feet are attached to the leg, and that you must prolong the silhouette. The shoe elongates the leg and does it discreetly. The goal is to get people to look at a woman’s legs. It’s all about the leg. No, it’s not about the leg. It’s about the woman.
