 - Teaching creationism in science class as an alternative to evolution is inappropriate.
 - The thing about a theory in science is it allows you make predictions. Evolutionary theory allows us to predict what apples will taste good next harvest.

 - Our goal in science is to discover universal laws of nature. If one’s faith requires one to abandon or ignore natural laws, well, that person is going to have trouble reconciling religion and science. Otherwise, there is no any conflict.
 - Science provides a much more satisfactory way to seek answers than does any religion.

 - Anybody who grew up with the space program is a fan of science fiction.
