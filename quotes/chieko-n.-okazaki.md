 - When we set aside the burden of judgment, then our hands and hearts are free to serve others with joy. Such service is truly the way of the Christian.
 - We know that service is indispensable for bringing us close to the Savior and letting us feel his Spirit. In nothing do we resemble the Savior more than in serving others. So in nothing should we feel greater love and joy than in service.
 - What would Christ do if he were in my situation?
 - If you’re doing the best you can, that’s good enough.
 - Hooray for differences! Without them, there would be no harmony. In principles, great clarity. In practices, great charity.
