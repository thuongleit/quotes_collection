 - Everything comes out in blues music: joy, pain, struggle. Blues is affirmation with absolute elegance.
 - Jazz music is the power of now.
 - Trumpet players are just belligerant, and cocky, and you know, just hard-headed.
 - There is an idea that a mind is wasted on the arts unless it makes you good in math or science. There is some evidence that the arts might help you in math and science.
 - Jazz is not the kind of music you are going to learn to play in three or four years or that you can just get because you have some talent for music.
 - I’m just lucky to have the type of friends and musicians and people dedicated to my music that I do.
 - Even if nobody’s singing, just when you talk, you’re singing. I’ll meet somebody and say, “Oh, I’m tone-deaf.” I say, “You’re not tone-deaf, because if you were tone-deaf you would speak like that. But you’re ‘Oh, I’m tone-deaf.’ You already sang a song to me.”
 - If you’re not making mistakes, you’re not trying.
 - Ethics are more important than laws.
 - A beat is a moment in the life a groove.

 - We need more math classes, we need more science. It’s the art of math and the art of science that creates all the innovation, and we have a tradition of great arts, great music.
 - Walt Whitman’s “Leaves of Grass” is still in print. They’re debating right now over Mark Twain. He’s still available. Winslow Homer can still be seen. Our arts are – they’re there. We got to go get them and understand that this is an important legacy for our country.
 - How great musicians demonstrate a mutual respect and trust on the bandstand can alter your outlook on the world and enrich every aspect of your life, understanding what it means to be a global citizen in the most modern sense.

 - There’s so much spirit of integration and democracy in jazz.
 - We created the spirituals. We created so much great music, jazz chief amongst our innovations, teaching us how to prize ourselves and how to speak to one another, that our kids don’t know that achievement, there’s no way in the world that could be good for us.
 - Don’t wish for someone else to do later what you can do now.
 - Blues is like the roux in a gumbo. People ask me if jazz always has the blues in it. I say, if it sounds good it does.
 - Music is the art of all the invisible things that are real. Art, emotion, spiritual essence, consciousness – these things are hard to prove. Music helps you to focus on your sound. We understand that for very young kids.
 - I grew up in the South, in New Orleans, where guys torture you all the time. So I didn’t really grow up on the self-esteem campaign. When you were lousy at something, they told you you were lousy, and they told you how to fix it.
 - Jazz music is the power of now. There is no script. It’s conversation. The emotion is given to you by musicians as they make split-second decisions to fulfill what they feel the moment requires.
 - I try to find the core values that are so fundamental that they transcend ethnic identity. That doesn’t mean I run from it. I embrace African-American culture and I love it and embrace it, but it is a part of a human identity. So I’m always trying to make a larger human statement.
 - Ethics are more important than laws. Which means that the exact note is less important than the feeling of the note.
 - New Orleans – the real New Orleans – is the soul of the country.
 - The first jazz musician was a trumpeter, Buddy Bolden, and the last will be a trumpeter, the archangel Gabriel.
 - Everything comes out in blues music: joy, pain, struggle. Blues is affirmation with absolute elegance. It’s about a man and a woman. So the pain and the struggle in the blues is that universal pain that comes from having your heart broken. Most blues songs are not about social statements.
 - Love is the spiritual essence of what we do. Technique is the manifestation of the preparation and investment as a result of the love.
 - Maybe the preoccupation with technological progress has overshadowed our concern with human progress.
 - We’re blues people. And blues never lets tragedy have the last word.
 - The black hole in democracy is integrity. The great unspoken is integrity. When integrity is not first and foremost, it’s quite palpable but not visible. It’s always there. Jazz highlights it because musicians and jazz always represented a high level of integrity.
 - Many of our greatest musicians abandoned all of their aesthetic objectives to try to become pertinent. And, at the end of the day, they never became pop stars. I counter stated that very strongly, and I continue to do that.
 - Through improvisation, jazz teaches you about yourself. And through swing, it teaches you that other people are individuals too. It teaches you how to coordinate with them.
 - I think that when the education system started to be dismantled during the first Great Depression in the 1930s, we didn’t recover from that.
 - It’s really not a stretch. The checks and balances are the same. The drums are the executive branch. The jazz orchestra is the legislative branch. Logic and reason are like jazz solos. The bass player is the judicial branch. One our greatest ever is Milt Hinton, and his nickname is “The Judge.”
 - I think that virtuosity is the first sign of morality in a musician. It means you’re serious enough to practice.
 - My mother always took my brothers and me to music lessons. There were six children. Our parents attended our concerts and encouraged us to study and enjoy many different types of music.

 - There’s the tradition in jazz of having the Battle of the Bands, and you do not want to get your head cut when you’re playing.
 - Louis Armstrong is jazz. He represents what the music is all about.
 - The people are not coming because of me. They didn’t come before me. It’s because of a lack of education and understanding, so it makes me more motivated. It’s like my mother said about having an artistic child – she learned more from him and he gets more attention and more of the love, not less.
 - Jazz is not just ‘Well, man, this is what I feel like playing.’ It’s a very structured thing that comes down from a tradition and requires a lot of thought and study.
 - Through first-class education, a generation marches down the long uncertain road of the future with confidence.
 - What I really have in my head, my imagination, my understanding of music, I never really get that out.
 - I believe in professionalism, but playing is not like a job. You have to be grateful to have the opportunity to play.
 - We all teach from that same frame of reference. We’re like neighborhood – the people who have had the opportunity through this music to gain a platform and spread the message of this music, which is basically love in a form of communication that’s honest and truthful.
 - I wanted to make somebody feel like Coltrane made me feel, listening to it.
 - The Duke and Swing represent affirmation in the face of adversity.
 - If you are serious about American culture and you are serious about Afro-American culture, you are in a lot of pain. You are not – you are not smiling about it.

 - If you looked around, you’d be glad you couldn’t see.
 - Music is always for the listener, but the first listener is always the musician.
 - We don’t have the leadership or the understanding of the value of this, and when your political systems and your economic systems start to fail, it’s only a cultural understanding that allows you to reconstruct them and to get back to who you are. For some reason, it hasn’t dawned on us yet.
 - I’ll write down and catalogue all the different devices that are Americana to me, and I try to have a historic depth and breadth and also the things that we do in our time, the type of vamps and chants, things that are available to us.
 - If you didn’t have the amalgam of Blacks and African-type sensibility and European sensibility, you wouldn’t have jazz. Even in the negative and in the positive ways – if there was no slavery and the abolition of slavery, there would be no jazz.
 - Certain music, jazz in particular, has the ability to make you a better citizen of the world. It helps you expand your world view and gives you more confidence in your cultural achievements. Improvisational jazz teaches you about yourself while the swing in jazz teaches you how to work with others.
 - In the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra we play such a diversity of music, with 10 arrangers in the band, we don’t really worry about whether it’s contemporary or not.
 - The blues is always there. It’s going to be hard out here, but it’s all right. It’s all right, and that’s what the blues teaches you. You got to roll with the punches and find your equilibrium.
 - For Black people, we’re one of the only groups of people that for some reason to express love of yourself, in some ways, is misconstrued as a dislike for someone else.
 - Jazz music creates so many phenomenal figures.
 - Art is a luxury. It’s not necessary for you to – you can work your job and you can make some money and never know who Walt Whitman was, and never read a poem.

 - We learn a language through its song, and even if you don’t have music you have the song of people you love’s voice, and you’ll notice that song in their voice.
 - The best way to be, is to do.
 - The musicians I respected were much older than me. I expected them to cut my head, and they did.
 - The main three components are the blues, improvisation – which is some kind of element that people are trying to make it up – and swing, which means even though they’re making up music, they’re trying to make it up together. It feels great, like you’re having a great conversation with somebody.
 - We no longer want to be a melting pot, because we don’t understand what is already melted.
 - There really have only ever been a few people in each generation who step out, are willing to put themselves on the line, and risk everything for their beliefs.
 - Flexibility is an essential part of Jazz. It’s what gives Jazz music the ability to combine with all other types of music and not lose its identity.
 - Grace Kelly plays with intelligence, wit and feeling. She has a great amount of natural ability and the ability to adapt. That is the hallmark of a first-class jazz musician.
 - There’s always the cliche of the choir shouting and clapping. OK, you have to do that, but there’s also introspective parts, parts where you just follow someone that’s preaching. There’s lots of different emotions and moods that a service requires.
 - My daddy expected that my brothers and I and our generation would make the world a better place. He had lived in an America of continual social progress.

 - This rebuilding of New Orleans gives us the perfect opportunity to see if we’re ready to extend the legacy of Dr. King.

 - I didn’t want to get that ring around my lips from practicing the trumpet, because I thought the girls wouldn’t like me. So I never practiced.

 - When I auditioned for my high school band the band director was excited because my father was known to be a great musician. When he heard me, he said ‘Are you sure you’re Ellis’s son?’
 - When I say “our,” I definitely mean all of America. It’s not less pertinent for you because it comes from a Black person, just like a great achievement by an Anglo American is less important.

 - Jazz comes from our way of life, and because it’s our national art form, it helps us to understand who we are.
 - I sounded like myself. People be saying I sound like Miles or Clifford Brown.
 - The arts speak across epochs. If you think that people started to build a cathedral in 1315 and the people worked on that cathedral, it wasn’t going to be finished until 1585. So they were thinking 200 years from now. Maybe by the time I die, this wall might be put up.
