 - Belief and delusion are incestuous siblings.
 - The funny thing is that in Bosnia there are no words that are equivalent to fiction and nonfiction. From the storytelling point of view, the difference is artificial.
 - If you can’t go home, there is nowhere to go, and nowhere is the biggest place in the world-indeed, nowhere is the world.
 - I had an epiphany: I was a loser.

 - I gradually became aware that my interiority was inseparable from my exteriority, that the geography of my city was the geography of my soul.

 - In Bosnian, there’s no distinction in literature between fiction and nonfiction; there’s no word describing that.
 - I actually didn’t listen to the Beatles song ‘Nowhere Man’ when I was writing my book of the same name. What I listened to a lot was ‘Abbey Road.’ Its disjointedness and its readiness to confuse only to delight were inspiring to me.
 - I hate traveling and being away from my family. But I like meeting my readers, as what I write is actualized in them. Those encounters are exhilarating to me.
 - Chicago is not a bad place to live. But the usual story of immigration is the happy fulfillment of human potential in America that is not available anywhere else – it’s propaganda, really. It’s more complicated than that.
 - All the lives I could live, all the people I will never know, never will be, they are everywhere. That is all that the world is.
 - Where can you go from nowhere, except deeper into nowhere?

 - My skin was the border between the world and me.
 - When I look at my old pictures, all I can see is what I used to be but am no longer. I think: What I can see is what I am not.
 - I loved you because there was no other place for me to go. We were married because we did not know what else to do with each other. You never knew me, nothing about me, what died inside me, what lived invisibly.
 - I don’t know the numbers, but roughly half of the people who came through Ellis Island returned home. They came here to make money, not to make history.
 - The perfect borscht is what life should be but never is.
 - It’s not that war crimes stop as soon as a novel about them is published. Literature operates slowly, it is always inching toward bliss, never quite getting there.
 - I write and read with the assumption that literature contains knowledge of human experience that is not available otherwise.
 - I’ve been a Nick Cave fan since the early ’80s when he was part of The Birthday Party thing singing Australian self-destructive rock band and I’ve always followed his work and loved it.
 - I want a book to contain a world – indeed the world. Writing is my main means of engagement with the world and I want the scars of that engagement to be left in the language.
 - I’ve read books in school that were written by ideological rote – they were brainwashers. Therefore, any art, any literature, that has a clearly defined political goal is repellent to me.
 - I’m not nervous if I think about something for nine years and then I don’t write it. Even if it fades it doesn’t concern me. It’ll come back if it’s worth it.
 - I’ve never meditated for a moment in my life. I don’t know how it works. But one of the things you have to do to put yourself in the meditating mode is stop narrating yourself to yourself.
 - To me there’s no difference between a book of stories and a novel – they’re just slightly different shapes.
 - I want to make money, and I would like to have a lot of money, but I still believe that the only reason to write is that somehow it will make something or somebody better.
 - You don’t want your neurosurgeon to have doubts about the meaning of it all while he or she is operating on your brain.

 - Time does nothing but hand you down shabbier and older things.
 - What I don’t like about America is not necessarily an American thing; it’s a capitalist thing. This is the Vatican of capitalism.
 - I know a lot of people in the city, at all levels, horizontally and vertically – and that to me is a privilege, to me as a person but also a writer. I’ve dined with billionaires, and I play soccer with busboys.
 - I like the idea of a book being a democratic space which readers enter, carrying their own thoughts, and participate in a conversation, or experience of grace.
 - There’s no connection between consumption of art and moral stamina at all.
 - Everyone operates within their own domain and obviously those domains overlap to a great extent.
 - Every artist, writers included, have an ethics and an aesthetics, whether they can formulate them or not. I happen to think that it is good to be able to formulate – it is good to know what you are doing and to be able to talk about it.
 - I wish I could avoid the people who have threatened me. My favorite threat is that I will be thrown in the River Miljacka, which is at most knee-deep, with my feet bound in cement.

 - What you demand from storytelling is a moral – even political – import. I tend to shun that didactic aspect.
 - We hated pretentiousness; it was a form of self-hatred.
 - I like to blow up this notion that all we have to do as writers and artists is represent reality, which is presumably solid and self-evident, with no negotiation of the gap between myself and the world, between this body and this space, which needs narration to close it.
 - My country’s main exports are stolen cars and sadness.
 - I don’t believe in inspiration. I write when I can’t avoid writing anymore.
 - The incessant perpetuation of collective fantasies makes people crave the truth and nothing but the truth – reality is the fastest American commodity.
 - It seemed that we loved each other better when there were large swaths of two continents between us. The daily work of love was often hard to perform at home.
 - The more you lose, the more is to be lost, yet it matters less.
 - To me, the solidarity of readers is far more important than the solidarity of writers, particularly since readers in fact find ways to connect over a book or books, whatever they may be.
 - There are moments in life when it is all turned inside out – what is real becomes unreal, what is unreal becomes tangible, and all your levelheaded efforts to keep a tight ontological control are rendered silly and indulgent.
 - I do believe – and I know I shouldn’t – that art transcends money and success and any of that. You can still do it if you’re not clinging to the notion of nobility.
 - It’s so internalized, the way your mind works in relation to anything – it’s a process, but then it isn’t. It’s working all the time.
 - Even if you tried to extinguish your personality, what is left in the story will reflect it, perhaps by its negation. Our lives provide the bricks from which we build these cathedrals.
 - Because sometimes you have no control over life and it keeps you far away from who you love.
 - A particular piece of music attaches itself to the piece I’m writing, and there is nothing else I can listen to. Every day I return to the same space to write, the music providing both the walls and the pictures on the walls.
 - The mind is complicated and you can’t trace the roots of its processes, but there is something about mathematical and algorithmic patterns that I like to recognize in things.
 - I do have a sense of displacement as constant instability – the uninterrupted existence of everything that I love and care about is not guaranteed at all. I wait for catastrophes.

 - I am a writer, which means I write stories, I write novels, and I would write poetry if I knew how to. I don’t want to limit myself.
 - The world is always greater than your desires; plenty is never enough.
 - If you have information you’ve got the world by the balls. But we have to convert information into knowledge in order to make it humanly useful.
 - For people who are displaced, you can reconstruct the story of your life from the objects you have access to, but if you don’t have the objects then there are holes in your life. This is why people in Bosnia – if anyone was running back into a burning house, it was to salvage photos.
 - I don’t like having a teaching job – office hours and conferences and committees and bosses and all that – but I tend to enjoy teaching, and I design the course in such a way that there’ll be pleasure in that.
 - What fiction and art can do, particularly narrative art, is construct consciousness – in a sense, we have to do it for the first time, every time.
 - You devise ways to tell a story that complies with your sensibility. Style and method are really extensions of your present sensibility.
 - I wanted us to share the sense that the number of wrong moves far exceeds the number of good moves, to share the frightening instability of the correct decision, to bond in being confounded.
 - Despite all that I know rationally, and everything that I can put into words, I can say that I have difficulty giving up the notion of the nobility of art.
 - Politics imagined as direct agency, whether by voting or by participating in politics, you can think you’re not political because you don’t do anything between elections.

 - I cannot think of a country in which I would be happy with the government and dominant ideology and available propaganda.
 - It is my belief that we as human beings have a need to tell stories – I think it’s evolutionary. So you can think of the short story as a literary form, or you can instead think of stories.
 - I tend to wait for true stories to mature into fiction. Most of my fiction grew out of a long-germinating real-life situation.
 - I have been on the margins in terms of having to find a place to live and getting a job, but at some point, and before that point, I always thought no matter where I am, that’s the center.

 - No reader owes me anything – I am owed nothing for my noble efforts, because my writing was always unconditional, always coming out of inner necessity.
 - I much preferred winning to thinking and I didn’t like losing at all.
 - You have to suspend thinking in narratives. The moment you are conscious of yourself the gap opens up. And in this gap, stories are generated.
 - Chicago has very few public spaces where people are encouraged to get together. It’s partly to prevent riots, and also to segregate a city with a history of racial segregation.

 - I’ll take any life in which I can make choices and have agency, and America is not a bad place for all that.
 - Anything that might come under arts should not be subject to the whims of the idiotic market because the market’s stupid, and it gravitates toward simplicity – towards essentializing things so they can be sold.

 - I did not intend to stay; I had no experience in the United States – I may have been here less than 24 hours – but I knew I would never get inside there. And ‘there’ not being America necessarily, but that harmonious mode of living that some people are lucky enough to have in this country.

 - Politics is about ethics and morality, openly or not openly.

 - Nobody deserves death, yet everybody gets it.
 - In some way there is no real life. It’s always the story of your life that you’re living.
 - There’s no bad writing; you did something. I was operating inside language, and I did something. I’m not ashamed of it.

 - The people who listened to rock ‘n’ roll, I thought, were bound together against the people who didn’t listen to rock ‘n’ roll. That, of course, didn’t work at all. Your taste in rock ‘n’ roll does not say anything about you, morally or otherwise.

 - We, as writers, have to figure out a way to create a consciousness in language. It’s crazy even to attempt to do that.
 - I never thought of myself as an outsider. Because outside of what? You would have to give advantage to this space where you’re not, to think of it as sovereign because you’re not there. I was always in the center of where I needed to be.
 - As long as there are living human beings, there will be language and stories.
