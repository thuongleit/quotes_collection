 - I’ve always wondered why love has to be so full of conflict and strife. Why can’t love be simple? Why can’t it just be as pure as two people who realize that they can’t live as well, or as happily, apart as they can together?
 - Looking for the good in people is never stupid.
 - Some things are just perfect, even when they don’t make any sense.
