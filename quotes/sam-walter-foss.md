 - Bring me men to match my mountains: Bring me men to match my plains: Men with empires in their purpose and new eras in their brains.
 - Let me live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man.
 - There are hermit souls that live withdrawn In the place of their self-content; There are souls like stars that dwell apart, In a fellowless firmament; There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths Where highways never ran, – But let me live by the side of the road, And be a friend to man.
 - The woods were made for the hunter of dreams.
 - Seek not for fresher founts afar, Just drop your bucket where you are; And while the ship right onward leaps, Uplift it from the exhaustless deeps. Parch not your life with dry despair; The stream of hope flow everywhere – So under every sky and star, Just drop your bucket where you are.
 - Strew gladness on the paths of men-You will not pass this way again.
 - A hundred thousand men were led By one calf near three centuries dead; They followed still his crooked way And lost a hundred years a day; For thus such reverence is lent To well established precedent.
 - Seek not for fresher founts afar, just drop you bucket where you are.
 - There are purple grapes in the Land of Git-Thare.
