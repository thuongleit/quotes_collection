 - The grace of God is dangerous. It’s lavish, excessive, outrageous, and scandalous. God’s grace is ridiculously inclusive. Apparently God doesn’t care who He loves. He is not very careful about the people He calls His friends or the people He calls His church.
 - Accepting the reality of our broken, flawed lives is the beginning of spirituality not because the spiritual life will remove our flaws but because we let go of seeking perfection and, instead, seek God, the one who is present in the tangledness of our lives.
 - The Church is the place where the incompetent, the unfinished, and even the unhealthy are welcome. I believe Jesus agrees.
 - Spiritual growth is more than procedure, it’s a wild search for God in the midst of the tangled jungle of our souls, a search for which involves a volatile mix of messy reality, wild freedom, frustrating stuckness, increasing slowness and a healthy dose of gratitude.
 - Religious people love to hide behind religion. They love the rules of religion more than they love Jesus. With practice, Condemners let rules become more important than the spiritual life.
 - Nothing makes people in the church more angry than grace. It’s ironic: we stumble into a party we weren’t invited to and find the uninvited standing at the door making sure no other uninviteds get in.
 - Christianity is not about learning how to live within the lines; Christianity is about the joy of coloring.
 - Speed is not neutral. Fast living used to mean a life of debauchery; now it just means fast, but the consequences are even more serious. Speeding through life endangers our relationships and our souls.
 - The power of the Church is not a parade of flawless people, but of a flawless Christ who embraces our flaws. The Church is not made up of whole people, rather of the broken people who find wholeness in a Christ who was broken for us.
 - For God so loved the world, that whosoever believes in him will, from that point on, be considered weired by the rest of the world, which means the church should be more like a zoo than a tomb of identical mummies.
 - Spiritual growth thrives in the midst of our problems, not in their absence. Spiritual growth occurs in the trenches of life, not in the classroom.
 - Spirituality isn’t about being finished and perfect; spirituality is about trusting God in our unfinishedness.
 - Just because we believe the gospel is a life-and-death matter doesn’t mean we have to act as if we’re dead.
 - Jesus cares more about desire than about competence.
 - Until we start thinking in terms of revolution instead of compromise the Church will continue to pat itself on the back with token steps of renewal.
 - Speed damages our souls because living fast consumes every ounce of our energy. Speed has a deafening roar that drowns our the whispering voices of our souls and leaves Jesus as a diminishing speck in the rearview mirror.
 - Play is an expression of God’s presence in the world; one clear sign of God’s absence in society is the absence of playfulness and laughter.
 - What landed Jesus on the cross was the preposterous idea that common, ordinary, broken, screwed-up people could be godly.
