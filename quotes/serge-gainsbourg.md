 - I know my limits. That’s why I’m beyond.
 - I like the night, I have clearer ideas in the dark.
 - I prefer ugliness to beauty, because ugliness endures.
 - No matter the time, carried away the wind is Better your absence Thy indifference.
 - I’ve succeeded at everything except my life.
 - I am incapable of mediocrity.
