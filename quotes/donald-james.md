 - When a well-packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations, the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic.
 - The ideal tyranny is that which is ignorantly self-administered by its victims. The most perfect slaves are, therefore, those which blissfully and unawaredly enslave themselves.
 - Better a sovereign in squalor than a slave in splendor.
 - At least half of my life’s many mistakes can be safely put down to impetuosity: the other half derive from inertia.
 - That got me a look so intense I was unable to interpret it – like the way cats sometimes fix on you. What they mean by the look is completely beyond understanding; but it’s meant for you, you alone.
 - The goal of tyrants is tyranny, and the goal of tyranny is tyranny.
