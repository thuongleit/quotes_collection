 - Lets go eat a God damn snack.
 - I can’t tell you how proud I am to be the head coach of the Buffalo Bills.
 - Jack Del Rio and myself are very similar except he’s really good looking and was a great player. Other than that, we’re very similar.
 - I know we’ll lead the league in defense.
 - I know it’s been 15 years since the Bills made the playoffs. Well get ready, man, we’re going. We are going.
 - We’re going to be as loyal to our fans as they are to us.
 - We will not build our offensive game plan around our punter. We will not major in punting.
 - We’re going to start with the injury report, obviously. Manning, Clark, Addai, Reggie Wayne, Freeney, Mathis, Brackett – all those guys will not play. Oh, hold up. That was my wish list for Santa Claus.
