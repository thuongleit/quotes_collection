 - It wasn’t an easy decision to leave out Bobo, because I could have done that with two or three from the back four. But there’s a limit to the players you have and the changes you can make. The reality is we’re not defending well enough. But we just have to plug on. There’s no magic formula.
 - People talk about how you make team spirit – is it golf days or going out drinking together? That doesn’t count. When you drink, you just tell lies to each other anyway and talk rubbish.
 - Paul Scholes has been the best England midfield player for 30-odd years. You’d probably have to go back to Bobby Charlton to find someone who could do as much as Scholes. When the ball arrives at his feet he could tell you where every player on that pitch is at that moment. His awareness is superb.

 - Are there Martians out there? I haven’t got a clue. Is there life out there? I have no idea.
 - I like to be able to control which players I’m working with. Because it doesn’t matter how good a coach you are if the guys you’re working with think they already know it all. You need a response, you need to feel they’re trying. I want players who are always striving to improve.
 - If I was English I’d kill myself.
