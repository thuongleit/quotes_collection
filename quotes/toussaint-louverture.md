 - It is easy to cut down the tree of liberty, but not so easy to restore it to life.
 - Whatever defamation of character my enemies are spreading about me, I do not feel the need to justify myself toward them. While discretion obliges me to remain silent, my duty compels me to prevent them from doing any more harm.
 - Unite; for combination is stronger than witchcraft.
 - I was born a slave, but nature gave me a soul of a free man.
