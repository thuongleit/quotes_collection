 - Black Velvet in that little boys smile, Black Velvet with that slow southern style. A new religion that’ll bring you to your knees.
 - I was charmed by a performance given by Crowded House at Toronto’s Massey Hall where the bass player broke a string.
 - My conscience aches but it’s going to lose the fight.
 - I also dance to music that makes me feel sexy in front of a mirror.
 - I give myself strength by staying away from any music.
