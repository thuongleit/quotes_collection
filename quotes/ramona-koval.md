 - We read to find out what the world is like, to experience lots of lives, not just the one we live. If it is true that our lives are chaotic and we crave a shape, stories are the shapes that we put on experience, containing all the wisdom in the world. We can even choose what kind of wisdom suits us.
 - I realised that reading was the key that opened the door to secret lands, strange places and the worlds behind other people’s eyes.
 - Not only does art imitate life but life imitates art. Perhaps we not only learn about life from stories, perhaps we make our lives through the stories we tell ourselves about the things that happen to us.
 - That’s what reading was for my mother, and became for me – a way to escape, a private time machine, a place that began with moral instruction but soon morphed into empathy and imagination.
 - It was disconcerting for the novel to seem so different when I re-read it. Of course we are a different person each time we open a book to read it again; we can never really experience it in the same way, just as we can never step into the same stream twice.
 - True browsing means that we discover shelves and subjects that we could not have anticipated when we started. And the books we read introduce us to other books, as if we are at a magnificent party of the mind, being ever welcomed by new friends to join in the conversation.
 - Books that recount ordeals are precious because an ordeal is what we most fear, and the stories that tell us how to survive them reassure us about what a human being is capable of, as we survive our own lives every day, our own mysterious journeys.
 - I learned that books could be collected, that they were important enough to keep and that a story that seemed to be over could be part of a bigger one.
 - That’s what is so precious in reading this way – you can plumb the depths of another’s experience while sitting still with a book in your hands.
 - Can we really be friends with those who don’t love the books that we do? Of course we can, but can we really be friends with those who don’t love any books? I’m not so sure of that.
