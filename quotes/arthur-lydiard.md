 - They have a word in Finnish called sisu, which basically means guts. It’s the strongest word in the Finnish language. You tell a Finn he doesn’t have sisu, that’s like spitting in his face.
 - There are champions everywhere. Every street’s got them. All we need to do is train them properly.
 - I have a saying ‘train, don’t strain.’ The Americans have the saying ‘no pain, no gain’ and that’s why they have no distance running champions. They get down to the track with a stopwatch and flog their guts out thinking that it’ll make them a champion, but they’ll never make a champion that way.

 - Encourage kids to enjoy running and play in athletics. Don’t force them to run too much competition.
 - My most frequent admonition to athletes and coaches is: train, do not strain.
 - If you want to be a successful runner, you have to consider everything. It’s no good just thinking about endurance and not to develop fine speed.
 - Well, no athlete respects a big, fat coach who’s going to stand there and rest the watch on his stomach.
