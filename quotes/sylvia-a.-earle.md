 - No water, no life. No blue, no green.
 - There’s plenty of water in the universe without life, but nowhere is there life without water.
 - I suggest to everyone: Look in the mirror. Ask yourself: Who are you? What are your talents? Use them, and do what you love.
 - Many of us ask what can I, as one person, do, but history shows us that everything good and bad starts because somebody does something or does not do something.
 - If the sea is sick, we’ll feel it. If it dies, we die. Our future and the state of the oceans are one.
 - With respect to the ocean being the heart of our blue planet: We are often asked, ‘How much protection is enough?’ We can only answer with another question: How much of your heart is worth protecting?
 - The oceans deserve our respect and care, but you have to know something before you can care about it.
 - Places change over time with or without oil spills, but humans are responsible for the Deepwater Horizon gusher – and humans, as well as the corals, fish and other creatures, are suffering the consequences.
 - Our past, our present, and whatever remains of our future, absolutely depend on what we do now.
 - Even if you never have the chance to see or touch the ocean, the ocean touches you with every breath you take, every drop of water you drink, every bite you consume. Everyone, everywhere is inextricably connected to and utterly dependent upon the existence of the sea.
 - Every time I slip into the ocean, it’s like going home.
 - Earth as an ecosystem stands out in the all of the universe. There’s no place that we know about that can support life as we know it, not even our sister planet, Mars, where we might set up housekeeping someday, but at great effort and trouble we have to recreate the things we take for granted here.
 - Everyone has power. But it doesn’t help if you don’t use it.
 - Far and away, the greatest threat to the ocean, and thus to ourselves, is ignorance. But we can do something about that.

 - Humans are the only creatures with the ability to dive deep in the sea, fly high in the sky, send instant messages around the globe, reflect on the past, assess the present and imagine the future.
 - We need to respect the oceans and take care of them as if our lives depended on it. Because they do.
 - It doesn’t matter where on Earth you live, everyone is utterly dependent on the existence of that lovely, living saltwater soup. There’s plenty of water in the universe without life, but nowhere is there life without water.
 - Great attention gets paid to rainforests because of the diversity of life there. Diversity in the oceans is even greater.
 - The most important part is to take on the challenge of protecting the ocean as if your life depends on it-because it does.
 - When I first ventured into the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, the sea appeared to be a blue infinity too large, too wild to be harmed by anything that people could do.
 - Forty percent of the United States drains into the Mississippi. It’s agriculture. It’s golf courses. It’s domestic runoff from our lawns and roads. Ultimately, where does it go? Downstream into the gulf.
 - By the end of the 20th century, up to 90 percent of the sharks, tuna, swordfish, marlins, groupers, turtles, whales, and many other large creatures that prospered in the Gulf for millions of years had been depleted by overfishing.
 - I want everybody to go jump in the ocean to see for themselves how beautiful it is, how important it is to get acquainted with fish swimming in the ocean, rather than just swimming with lemon slices and butter.
 - When I arrived on the planet, there were only two billion. Wildlife was more abundant, we were less so; now the situation is reversed.
 - The sudden release of five million barrels of oil, enormous quantities of methane and two million gallons of toxic dispersants into an already greatly stressed Gulf of Mexico will permanently alter the nature of the area.
 - We’ve got to somehow stabilize our connection to nature so that in 50 years from now, 500 years, 5,000 years from now there will still be a wild system and respect for what it takes to sustain us.
 - If you think the ocean isn’t important, imagine Earth without it. Mars comes to mind. No ocean, no life support system.

 - There’s something missing about how we’re informing the youngsters coming along about what matters in the world. We teach them the numbers and the letters, but we fail to communicate the importance of our connection to the living world.
 - Just as we have the power to harm the ocean, we have the power to put in place policies and modify our own behavior in ways that would be an insurance policy for the future of the sea, for the creatures there, and for us, protecting special critical areas in the ocean.

 - The Exxon Valdez spill triggered a swift and strong response that changed policies about shipping, about double-hulled construction. A number of laws came into place.
 - Look at the bark of a redwood, and you see moss. If you peer beneath the bits and pieces of the moss, you’ll see toads, small insects, a whole host of life that prospers in that miniature environment. A lumberman will look at a forest and see so many board feet of lumber. I see a living city.
 - I love music of all kinds, but there’s no greater music than the sound of my grandchildren laughing; my kids, too.
 - I am not in any hurry to grow up.
 - The best scientists and explorers have the attributes of kids! They ask question and have a sense of wonder. They have curiosity. ‘Who, what, where, why, when, and how!’ They never stop asking questions, and I never stop asking questions, just like a five year old.
 - We have become frighteningly effective at altering nature.
 - Scientists never stop asking. They’re little kids who never grew up.
 - Health to the ocean means health for us.
 - Any astronaut can tell you you’ve got to do everything you can to learn about your life support system and then do everything you can to take care of it.
 - Most of life on Earth has a deep past, much deeper than ours. And we have benefited from the distillation of all preceding history, call it evolutionary history if you will.

 - People still do not understand that a live fish is more valuable than a dead one, and that destructive fishing techniques are taking a wrecking ball to biodiversity.
 - America gains most when individuals have great freedom to pursue personal goals without undue government interference.
 - As a child, I was aware of the widely-held attitude that the ocean is so big, so resilient that we could use the sea as the ultimate place to dispose of anything we did not want, from garbage and nuclear wastes to sludge from sewage to entire ships that had reached the end of their useful life.
 - I’m haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls ‘tomorrow’s child,’ asking why we didn’t do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time. Well, now is that time.
 - We have been far too aggressive about extracting ocean wildlife, not appreciating that there are limits and even points of no return.
 - If Darwin could get into a submarine and see what I’ve seen, thousand of feet beneath the ocean, I am just confident that he would be inspired to sit down and start writing all over again.

 - I actually love diving at night; you see a lot of fish then that you don’t see in the daytime.
 - What we once used as weapons of war, we now use as weapons against fish.
 - If we have a hope of really understanding our place in nature and of carving out a place for ourselves that is sustainable, it’s primarily because of the new level of communication. It used to be, ‘What you don’t have in your mind, you have on your shelf.’ But now we have the Web.
 - I’ve always said, ‘Underwater or on top, men and women are compatible.’
 - You don’t have to touch the ocean for the ocean to touch you.

 - The Arctic is an ocean. The southern pole is a continent surrounded by ocean. The North Pole is an ocean, or northern waters. It’s an ocean surrounded by land, basically.
 - Like a shipwreck or a jetty, almost anything that forms a structure in the ocean, whether it is natural or artificial over time, collects life.

 - I personally have stopped eating seafood.
 - Evolution is not something to be feared. It’s to be celebrated, embraced, and understood.
