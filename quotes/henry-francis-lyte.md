 - Abide with me: fast falls the eventide; The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide.
 - Praise, my soul, the King of Heaven; To his feet thy tribute bring. Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven, Who like me his praise should sing?
 - I need thy presence every passing hour; What but thy grace can foil the tempterâ€™s power?
 - Change and decay in all around I see...
 - Teach me. Lord, my true condition; Bring me childlike to Thy knee; Stripped of every low ambition, Willing to be led by Thee.
