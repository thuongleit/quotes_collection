 - I have found a very great number of exceedingly beautiful theorems.
 - And perhaps, posterity will thank me for having shown that the ancients did not know everything.
 - I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which however the margin is not large enough to contain.
 - It is impossible for any number which is a power greater than the second to be written as a sum of two like powers. I have a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.
 - I am more exempt and more distant than any man in the world.
 - To divide a cube into two other cubes, a fourth power, or in general any power whatever into two powers of the same denomination above the second is impossible, and I have assuredly found an admirable proof of this, but the margin is too narrow to contain it.
