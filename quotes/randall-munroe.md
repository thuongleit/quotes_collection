 - A million people can call the mountains a fiction, yet it need not trouble you as you stand atop them.
 - I think the really cool and compelling thing about math and physics is that it opens up entry to all these hypotheticals – or at least, it gives you the language to talk about them. But at the same time, if a scenario is completely disconnected from reality, it’s not all that interesting.
