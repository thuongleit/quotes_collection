 - Nothing in life is certain except death, taxes, and the second law of thermodynamics.
 - The history of the universe is, in effect, a huge and ongoing quantum computation. The universe is a quantum computer.
 - Indeed, as the above calculation indicates, to take full advantage of the memory space available, the ultimate laptop must turn all its matter into energy.
 - The amount of information that can be stored by the ultimate laptop, 10 to the 31st bits, is much higher than the 10 to the 10th bits stored on current laptops.
 - I have not proved that the universe is, in fact, a digital computer and that it’s capable of performing universal computation, but it’s plausible that it is.
 - I would suggest, merely as a metaphor here, but also as the basis for a scientific program to investigate the computational capacity of the universe, that this is also a reasonable explanation for why the universe is complex.
 - When you zap things with light to build quantum computers, you’re hacking existing systems. You’re hijacking the computation that’s already happening in the universe, just like a hacker takes over someone else’s computer.
 - Meaning is like pornography, you know it when you see it.
 - Quantum mechanics is weird. I don’t understand it. Just live with it. You don’t have to understand the nature of things in order to build cool devices.
 - When it comes to their capacity to screw things up, computers are becoming more human every day.
 - If you wanted to build the most powerful computer you could, you can’t do better than including everything in the universe that’s potentially available.
 - Programmed by quanta, physics gave rise first to chemistry and then to life; programmed by mutations and recombination, life gave rise to Shakespeare; programmed by experience and imagination, Shakespeare gave rise to Hamlet.
 - Instead of having to be a member of the Royal Society to do science, the way you had to be in England in the 17th, 18th, centuries today pretty much anybody who wants to do it can, and the information that they need to do it is there.
 - What’s happened with society is that we have created these devices, computers, which already can register and process huge amounts of information, which is a significant fraction of the amount of information that human beings themselves, as a species, can process.
 - Thinking of the universe as a computer is controversial.
 - Of course, not everybody’s willing to go out and do the experiments, but for the people who are willing to go out and do that, – if the experiments don’t work, then it means it’s not science.
 - Bits of ignorance are like viruses that are copied and spread by interaction.
 - Another feature that everybody notices about the universe is that it’s complex.
 - All physical systems can be thought of as registering and processing information, and how one wishes to define computation will determine your view of what computation consists of.
 - Science consists exactly of those forms of knowledge that can be verified and duplicated by anybody.
 - Every physical system registers information, and just by evolving in time, by doing its thing, it changes that information, transforms that information, or, if you like, processes that information.
 - In order to figure out how to make atoms compute, you have to learn how to speak their language and to understand how they process information under normal circumstances.
 - It’s also a reasonable scientific program to look at the dynamics of the standard model and to try to prove from that dynamics that it is computationally capable.
 - Some folks think life and technology and mind can keep expanding forever. Others say it can’t. We are still not clear on that.
 - If you take a more Darwinian point of view the dynamics of the universe are such that as the universe evolved in time, complex systems arose out of the natural dynamics of the universe.
 - According to the standard model billions of years ago some little quantum fluctuation, perhaps a slightly lower density of matter, maybe right where we’re sitting right now, caused our galaxy to start collapsing around here.
 - There are considerable advantages to using many degrees of freedom to store information, stability and controllability being perhaps the most important.
 - One of the things that I’ve been doing recently in my scientific research is to ask this question: Is the universe actually capable of performing things like digital computations?
 - Computers are famous for being able to do complicated things starting from simple programs.
 - At some point, Moore’s law will break down.
