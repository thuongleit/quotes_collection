 - People think modeling’s mindless, that you just stand there and pose, but it doesn’t have to be that way. I like to have a lot of input, I know how to wear a dress, whether it should be shot with me standing up or sitting down. And I’m not scared to say what I think.
 - I was having panic attacks. I didn’t want to live that way anymore. I was in love and I wanted it to work. I was tired of travelling, tired of the whole scene, just tired. I sat around. I was lazy. I wanted a routine, and I wanted to wake up in the same bed every day, and I got my wish.

 - In photos, I don’t know who the real me is – it’s all pretend, just pretend. There’s not much of myself in my work. If I’m looking in the mirror and I’m working, I’m looking at my make-up and my hair. It’s not the same as looking at myself.
