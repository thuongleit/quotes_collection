 - You know the great thing, though, is that change can be so constant you don’t even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don’t even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away, make you something different in an instant.
 - I can tell you I love you as many times as you can stand to hear it, but all it does is remind us that love is not enough. Not even close.
 - If you stare at someone long enough, you start to see their humanity.
