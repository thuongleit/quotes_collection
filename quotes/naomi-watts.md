I’m not a man but I don’t think it would occupy their minds as much.
 - The thing that I love about acting is the fact that I can help people feel things, know themselves or feel less alone. It’s my form of expression, in the same way that someone might paint a picture or sing a song in that you’re hoping that it moves somebody outside of their own way of thinking.
