 - Don’t wait for your ship to come in, swim out to it.
 - Eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we may diet.
 - In the old days it was called voodoo and they stuck needles in dolls, now it’s called acupuncture and they stick the needles straight into the person.
 - There will always be people for and against you, and its pointless wasting time trying to win over some of the people who are against you. Spend time with people who are for you. Those realtionships are worth it.
