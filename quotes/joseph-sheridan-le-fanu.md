 - What a fool I was! and yet, in the sight of angels, are we any wiser as we grow older? It seems to me, only, that our illusions change as we go on; but, still, we are madmen all the same.
 - But to die as lovers may – to die together, so that they may live together.
 - Nevertheless, life and death are mysterious states, and we know little of the resources of either.
