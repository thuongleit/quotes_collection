 - Winning companies win because they have good leaders who nurture the development of other leaders at all levels of the organization.
 - There are all sorts of ways a leader can foster interactive teaching and learning if he starts thinking, Where do I socially architect myself?
 - Effective leaders are willing to use power and authority, but they’re doing it in the service of the collective good, as opposed to self-aggrandizement.
 - There are three processes every company has to have: Somehow you’ve got to set strategies; you’ve got to have a budget, so you need an annual operating plan; and somehow you’ve got to do succession and people planning.
 - Too many people are confusing charisma with autocrat, fat cat. So I think we have to be a little more sophisticated when we hold up or tear down these stereotypes. Whether we call it charisma or not, a leader cannot be self-effacing to the point of being wimpy.
