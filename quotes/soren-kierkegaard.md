 - A fire broke out backstage in a theatre. The clown came out to warn the public; they thought it was a joke and applauded. He repeated it; the acclaim was even greater. I think that’s just how the world will come to an end: to general applause from wits who believe it’s a joke.

 - People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use.

 - There is nothing with which every man is so afraid as getting to know how enormously much he is capable of doing and becoming.
 - What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.

 - Happiness is the greatest hiding place for despair.
 - Just as in earthly life lovers long for the moment when they are able to breathe forth their love for each other, to let their souls blend in a soft whisper, so the mystic longs for the moment when in prayer he can, as it were, creep into God.

 - Worldly wisdom thinks that love is a relationship between man and man. Christianity teaches that love is a relationship between man-God-man, that is, that God is the middle term.

 - The task must be made difficult, for only the difficult inspires the noble-hearted.
 - Reflection is not the evil; but a reflective condition and the deadlock which it involves, by transforming the capacity for action into a means of escape from action, is both corrupt and dangerous, and leads in the end to a retrograde movement.
 - Every mental act is composed of doubt and belief, but it is belief that is the positive, it is belief that sustains thought and holds the world together.

 - Are you not aware that there comes a midnight hour when everyone must unmask...
 - Faith is the highest passion in a human being. Many in every generation may not come that far, but none comes further.

 - Comparison is the most dangerous acquaintance love can make.
 - Language has time as its element; all other media have space as their element.
 - For the sadness in legitimate humour consists in the fact that honestly and without deceit it reflects in a purely human way upon what it is to be a child.
 - On the whole, the longing for solitude is a sign that there still is spirit in a person and is a measure of what spirit there is.

 - Which is more difficult, to awaken one who sleeps or to awaken one who, awake, dreams that he is awake?
 - Silence is the demon’s trap, and the more one is silenced, the more terrible the demon; but silence is also the divinity’s mutual understanding with the single individual.
 - I am so fed up and joyless that not only have I nothing to fill my soul, I cannot even conceive of anything that could possibly satisfy it – alas, not even the bliss of heaven.

 - Irony is a disciplinarian feared only by those who do not know it, but cherished by those who do.
 - That which is truly human no generation learns from the one before it. No generation learns from another how to love. No generation has a shorter task assigned to it except insofar as the previous generation shirked its task and deluded itself.
