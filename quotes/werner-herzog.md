 - Civilization is like a thin layer of ice upon a deep ocean of chaos and darkness.
 - I believe the common denominator of the universe is not harmony; but chaos, hostility and murder.
 - Do you not then hear this horrible scream all around you that people usually call silence.
 - Life in the oceans must be sheer hell. A vast, merciless hell of permanent and immediate danger. So much of a hell that during evolution some species – including man – crawled, fled onto some small continents of solid land, where the Lessons of Darkness continue.
 - Tourism is a mortal sin.
 - Every man should pull a boat over a mountain once in his life.
 - Look into the eyes of a chicken and you will see real stupidity. It is a kind of bottomless stupidity, a fiendish stupidity. They are the most horrifying, cannibalistic and nightmarish creatures in the world.
 - If you don’t read, you will never be a filmmaker.
 - What would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams.
 - I despise formal restaurants. I find all of that formality to be very base and vile. I would much rather eat potato chips on the sidewalk.
 - Sometimes bad luck hits you like in an ancient Greek tragedy, and it’s not your own making. When you have a plane crash, it’s not your fault.
 - I have never been one of those who cares about happiness. Happiness is a strange notion. I am just not made for it. It has never been a goal of mine; I do not think in those terms.
 - Get used to the bear behind you.
 - Academia is the death of cinema. It is the very opposite of passion. Film is not the art of scholars, but of illiterates.
 - Film is not analysis, it is the agitation of mind; cinema comes from the country fair and the circus, not from art and academicism.
 - May I propose a Herzog dictum? those who read own the world, and those who watch television lose it.
 - I prefer to be alive, so I’m cautious about taking risks.
 - I am torn between the beauty of the natural world, which you see all around us, and the idea that some dumb tornado could blow a telephone pole onto my sweet Camaro.
 - I think it is a quest of literature throughout the ages to describe the human condition.
 - We are surrounded by worn-out, banal, useless and exhausted images, limping and dragging themselves behind the rest of our cultural evolution.
 - For me a true landscape is not just a representation of a desert or a forest. It shows an inner state of mind, literally inner landscapes, and it is the human soul that is visible through the landscapes presented in my films.
 - I think psychology and self-reflection is one of the major catastrophes of the twentieth century.
 - Fact creates norms, and truth illumination.
 - I love nature, but against my better judgment.
 - If you do not have an absolutely clear vision of something, where you can follow the light to the end of the tunnel, then it doesn’t matter whether you’re bold or cowardly, or whether you’re stupid or intelligent. Doesn’t get you anywhere.
 - I’m not into the culture of complaint. I roll up my sleeves and somehow I get it together.
 - Ambition is to be the fastest runner on this planet, to be the first on the South Pole, which is a grotesque perversion of ambition. It’s an ego trip, and I’m not on an ego trip. I don’t have ambitions – I have a vision.
 - You will learn more by walking from Canada to Guatemala than you will ever learn in film school.
 - I would travel down to Hell and wrestle a film away from the devil if it was necessary.
 - When you look at the paintings at Chauvet Cave, they’re not primitive or like children’s little scribbles, it bursts on the scene fully accomplished and when you look through the faces of cultural history, art history, it has never gotten any better.
 - I have a great map of the Tibesti Mountains in the southern Sahara or Northern Chad. It’s a dream of mine to go there, but it’s such a volatile area, you have to be prudent.
 - I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature.
 - People think we had a love-hate relationship. Well, I did not love him, nor did I hate him. We had mutual respect for each other, even as we both planned each other’s murder.
 - The danger is to stupidly believe that depicting facts gives us much insight. If facts were the only thing that counted, the telephone directory would be the book of books.
 - Money doesn’t make films. You just do it and take the initiative.
 - The punishment itself is something I respectfully disagree with, but for thousands and thousands of years it was practiced everywhere.
 - A fairly young, intelligent-looking man with long hair asked me whether filming or being filmed could do harm, whether it could destroy a person. In my heart the answer was yes, but I said no.

 - We ought to be grateful that the Universe out there knows no smile.
 - The world reveals itself to those who travel on foot.
 - If I had to climb into hell and wrestle the devil himself for one of my films, I would do it.
 - In my films, I hope there are a few moments where you feel almost illuminated, like in a state of ecstasy, stepping out of yourself, beyond yourself and perceiving something which is only, in the case of cinema, possible in collective dreams.
 - There are deeper strata of truth in cinema, and there is such a thing as poetic, ecstatic truth. It is mysterious and elusive, and can be reached only through fabrication and imagination and stylization.
 - Martin Luther was asked, what would you do if tomorrow the world would come to an end, and he said, ‘I would plant an apple tree today.’ This is a real good answer. I would start shooting a movie.

 - Never wallow in your troubles; despair must be kept private and brief.
 - The universe is not harmonious: you know that by looking outside.
 - I think the worst that can happen in filmmaking is if you’re working with a storyboard. That kills all intuition, all fantasy, all creativity.

 - I have nothing against 3D films but I do not need to see them.
 - Everyone who makes films has to be an athlete to a certain degree because cinema does not come from abstract academic thinking; it comes from your knees and thighs.
 - I am someone who takes everything very literally. I simply do not understand irony, a defect I have had ever since I was able to think independently.
 - I’m not a journalist; I’m a poet.

 - I never planned my career in steps. It’s all coming at me like burglars in the night.
 - Someone like Jean-Luc Godard is for me intellectual counterfeit money when compared to a good kung fu film.
 - I know for sure that there is only one step from insecticide to genocide.
 - You must live life in its very elementary forms. The Mexicans have a very nice word for it: pura vida. It doesn’t mean just purity of life, but the raw, stark-naked quality of life. And that’s what makes young people more into a filmmaker than academia.
 - In the Chauvet Cave, there is a painting of a bison embracing the lower part of a naked female body. Why does Pablo Picasso, who had no knowledge of the Chauvet Cave, use exactly the same motif in his series of drawings of the Minotaur and the woman? Very, very strange.
 - If you want to propose marriage to your girlfriend and you live in England and she is in Sicily, do the decent thing and walk down there. Travelling by car or aeroplane wouldn’t be right at such a moment.

 - Of course, as a German, I wouldn’t like to tell the American people how to handle their criminal justice.
 - I don’t spend sleepless nights over getting very bad reviews.
 - I don’t care whether the person is guilty or not guilty. It’s not my business to establish guilt or innocence. It’s a court of law that does that and a jury does that, but not me.
 - I have always postulated that we have to find a new way to deal with reality. It’s not so much facts that interest me, but a deeper truth in them – an ecstasy of truth, an ecstatic truth that illuminates us. That’s what I’ve been after.
 - I live my life outside of the glitz and glamour of the red carpet events, and so you’ll never see me there. I’m never at parties.
 - I function better in the jungle in Amazonia or Antarctica or Alaska or the Sahara desert. An artificial environment like a studio has never attracted me. I could work in a studio, but I would never really feel at home.

 - If you want to do a film, steal a camera, steal raw stock, sneak into a lab and do it!
 - It’s all movies for me. And besides, when you say documentaries, in my case, in most of these cases, means “feature film” in disguise.

 - There is a fascination about crime, which is understandable, but hardly anyone talks about the families of victims of violent crime and the devastation that is beyond the victim alone.

 - Facts sometimes have a strange and bizarre power that makes their inherent truth seem unbelievable.
