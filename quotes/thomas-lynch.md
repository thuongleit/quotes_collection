 - A good funeral gets the dead where they need to go and the living where they need to be.
 - Grief is the tax we pay on our attachments...
 - I’m lazy but generally task oriented so having a hoop to jump through means eventually I’ll make the effort.
 - There’s no easy way to do this. So do it right: weep, laugh, watch, pray, love, live, give thanks and praise; comfort, mend, honor, and remember.
 - If I were assigned poems I suppose I’d write more of them but it is entirely voluntary and for the most part ignored in the market sense of the word so the language to me is most intimate, most important, most sublime and most satisfying when it gets done.
 - I’m more interested in the meaning of funerals and the mourning that people do. It’s not a retail experience. It’s an existential one.
 - So I suppose poetry, language, the shaping of it, was and remains for me an effort to make sense out of essentially senseless situations.
 - But poetry is a way of language, it is not its subject or its maker’s background or interests or hobbies or fixations. It is nearer to utterance than history.
 - Grief is the price we pay for being close to one another. If we want to avoid our grief, we simply avoid each other.
 - Wanting to be near my bread and butter business which was my hairstyling salon, I have done little touring during my lifetime. I hate all this moving around from hotel to hotel, packing and unpacking. I know many entertainers agree with me on this subject.
 - Poems seem to have a life of their own. They tell you when enough is enough.
