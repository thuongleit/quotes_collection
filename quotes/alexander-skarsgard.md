 - I’m not very active on social media. I’m not on Facebook or Twitter or Instagram, or anything like that. But I think it’s wonderful that they’re out there. They’re fantastic. I have a lot of siblings and friends that use it, and it’s great for them. It’s such a connected world.
 - To turn off your phone when you go to your country house or you’re on vacation for a few days is important. I turn off my phone and just check it once a day. I turn it on and, if it’s an important message, I’ll call back. Otherwise, it can wait.
 - I don’t fall often, but I fall hard. And when you fall hard, it takes a while to get up.

 - I’m pretty intense when it comes to relationships, platonic ones as well. If I feel a connection with someone, I’m willing to go there.
 - There’s something I love about how stark the contrast is between January and June in Sweden. In a way, I feel that time doesn’t exist in LA. Sometimes I don’t know if it’s February or April or October, because you’re always sitting outside on the same patio, and it’s 70 degrees.
 - Life is crazy. You travel and you’re busy and there’s so much going on that it’s important to have the moments where you can breathe and you can just be present with the person or the people that you’re there with.

 - When I’m on a plane, people know where I’m going before I even know where I’m going. People know where you had lunch yesterday, or who you had lunch with. So, trying to avoid sharing everything with everyone is my way of keeping something private in my life.
 - A lot of times we associate Greenpeace and climate change and shrinking polar caps with heavy-handed, weighty material. It’s somber stuff. But with Funny Or Die we thought we could put an interesting take on it. Make it a little more palatable, especially for young people who tune into the website.

 - I’m from Sweden. We don’t wear clothes in Sweden.
 - Swedes are such a civilised, perfect society – at least on the surface. There’s a great safety net, a huge middle class, free education, free health care. People are very polite, they wait their turn. They’re not too loud, they’re not too quiet, but sometimes it’s a little too perfect.
