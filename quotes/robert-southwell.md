 - God gave Himself to you: give yourself to God.
 - Not where I breathe, but where I love, I live.
 - I wealthiest am when richest in remorse.
 - Hoist up sail while gale doth last, Tide and wind stay no manâ€™s pleasure.
 - The path to Heaven is narrow, rough and full of wearisome and trying ascents, nor can it be trodden without great toil; and therefore wrong is their way, gross their error, and assured their ruin who, after the testimony of so many thousands of saints, will not learn where to settle their footing.
 - Where sin was hatched, let tears now wash the nest.
 - My mind to me an empire is.
 - Times go by turns, and chances change by course, from foul to fair, from better hap to worse.
 - Christianity is warfare, and Christians are spiritualsoldiers.
 - Lingering labors come to naught.
 - What thought can think, another thought can mend.
 - When Fortune smiles, I smile to think how quickly she will frown.
 - Few have all they need, none all they wish.
