 - My heart is the throne of the Beloved, the Beloved the heart’s destiny: Whoever breaks another’s heart will find no homecoming in this world or any other.
 - Whatever separates you from the Truth, throw it away, it will vanish anyhow...
 - The earth shall be left to no one.
 - A heart makes a good home for the friend.
 - Thought is an errand boy, fear a mine of worries.
 - Too many words are lit for a beast of burden.
 - To love the world is to be afflicted.
