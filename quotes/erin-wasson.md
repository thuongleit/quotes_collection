 - The people who really know me understand that I have a tough exterior, but I’m actually just a hippie at heart.
 - I loathe hair salons. People have always told me I am in the wrong business because I can’t stand getting my hair cut or having it messed around with. Hairdressers feel as if they’ve got to be your shrinks. I just want them to do my hair so I can get out of there.
 - I am rough around the edges, and I am not a polished girl.
