 - You want it? Work for it.
 - You live to play in the playoffs. It’s like your heart is ripped out.
 - If we can continue to win, hopefully they can falter a little down the stretch.
 - I know it sounds stupid, but we’re just playing. We’re playing hard, but we’re just playing.
 - I’m on the third line. I’m a crasher. I know my role. I’m just trying to help. I’m not stupid enough to think I’m great out there.
