 - Happiness is simply to allow everything to be exactly as it is from moment to moment.
 - In ignorance I am something; in understanding I am nothing, in love I am everything.
 - The discovery that peace, happiness and love are ever-present within our own Being, and completely available at every moment of experience, under all conditions, is the most important discovery that anyone can make.
 - Love is the natural condition of all experience before thought has divided it into a multiplicity and diversity of objects, selves and others.
 - Give your attention to the experience of seeing rather than to the object seen and you will find yourself everywhere.
 - We don’t have to wait for the right circumstances to have happiness.
 - Time is the eternal now, seen through the narrow slit of the mind.
 - Looking for happiness in the body, mind or world is like looking for the screen in a movie. The screen doesn’t appear in the movie, and yet, at the same time, all that is seen in the movie is the screen. In the same way that the screen ‘hides’ in plain view, so happiness ‘hides’ in all experience.
 - The greatest discovery in life is to discover that our essential nature does not share the limits nor the destiny of the body and mind.
 - Many of our ideas and beliefs about ourselves and the world are so deeply ingrained that we are unaware that they are beliefs and take them, without question, for the absolute truth.
 - Love is the experience that others are not others. Beauty is the experience that objects are not objects.
 - When feeling is divested of the feeler and the felt, it shines as love; when seeing is divested of the seer and the seen, it shines as beauty.
 - We take that which is unreal to be real and that which is real to be unreal.
 - The mind, the body and the world are made out of Consciousness but Consciousness is not made out of them. It is made out of itself. Therefore everything is made only out of Consciousness.
