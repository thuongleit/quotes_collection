 - Prayer is – listening for the still small voice of God. Listening with the “ear of our hearts.”

 - Simplicity is freedom.
 - In intellectual honesty, we should be willing to study and explore the spiritual life with all the rigor and determination we would give to any field of research.

 - Simplicity is the only thing that sufficiently reorients our lives so that possessions can be genuinely enjoyed without destroying us.
 - The discovery of God lies in the daily and the ordinary, not in the spectacular and the heroic. If we cannot find God in the routines of home and shop, then we will not find Him at all.
 - Conformity to a sick society is to be sick.
 - Joy, not grit, is the hallmark of holy obedience. We need to be light-hearted in what we do to avoid taking ourselves too seriously. It is a cheerful revolt against self and pride.
 - May God give you – and me- the courage, the wisdom, the strength always to hold the kingdom of God as the number one priority of our lives. To do so is to live in simplicity.
 - Today the heart of God is an open wound of love. He aches over our distance and preoccupation. He mourns that we do not draw near to Him. He grieves that we have forgotten Him. He weeps over our obsession with muchness and manyness. He longs for our presence.
 - The spiritual discipline of simplicity is not a lost dream, but a recurrent version throughout history. It can be recaptured today. It must be.
 - Goals are discovered, not made.
 - If the Lord is to be Lord, worship must have priority in our lives. The divine priority is worship first, service second.
 - Stop trying to impress people with your clothes and impress them with your life.

 - Let’s discipline ourselves so that our words are few and full.
 - If worship does not change us it has not been worship.

 - Eastern meditation is an attempt to empty the mind; Christian meditation is an attempt to fill the mind. The two ideas are quite different.
 - Our God is not made of stone. His heart is the most sensitive and tender of all. No act goes unnoticed, no matter how insignificant or small. A cup of cold water is enough to put tears in the eyes of God. God celebrates our feeble expressions of gratitude.
 - When we genuinely believe that inner transformation is God’s work and not ours, we can put to rest our passion to set others straight.
 - Countless people pray far more than they know. Often they have such a “stained-glass” image of prayer that they fail to recognize what they are experiencing as prayer and so condemn themselves for not praying.
 - Love, not anger, brought Jesus to the cross. Golgotha came as a result of God’s great desire to forgive, not his reluctance. Jesus knew that by his vicarious suffering he could actually absorb all the evil of humanity and so heal it, forgive it, redeem it.
 - To pray is to change. This is a great grace. How good of God to provide a path whereby our lives can be taken over by love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness and faithfulness and gentleness and self-control.
 - Owning things is an obsession in our culture. If we own it, we feel we can control it; and if we control it, we feel it will give us more pleasure. The idea is an illusion.
 - Adoration is the spontaneous yearning of the heart to worship, honor, magnify, and bless God. We ask nothing but to cherish him. We seek nothing but his exaltation. We focus on nothing but his goodness.
 - We must understand the connection between inner solitude and inner silence; they are inseparable. All the masters of the interior life speak of the two in the same breath.
 - You see, we need instruction on how to possess money without being possessed by money. We need help to learn how to own things without treasuring them. We need the discipline that will allow us to live simply while managing great wealth and power.
 - Prayer is more than thoughts and feelings expressed in words. It is the opening of mind and heart – our whole being to God our Abba Father. It is Divine Union.
 - Spiritual direction involves a process through which one person helps another person understand what God is doing and saying.
 - The inner attitude of the heart is far more crucial than the mechanics for coming into the reality of the spiritual life.
 - Our problem is that we assume prayer is something to master the way we master algebra or auto mechanics. But when praying, we come “underneath,” where we calmly and deliberately surrender control and become incompetent.
 - Silence is one of the deepest Disciplines of the Spirit, simply because it puts the stopper on all self-justificat ion.
 - If we are silent when we should speak, we are not living the Discipline of silence. If we speak when we should be silent, we again miss the mark.
 - The person who does not seek the kingdom first does not seek it at all, regardless of how worthy the idolatry that he or she has substituted for it.
 - Prayer is the human response to the perpetual outpouring of love by which God lays siege to every soul.
