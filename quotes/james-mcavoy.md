 - I take a lot of pride in being myself. I’m comfortable with who I am.

 - A story about my life would be utterly dull.
 - Passing my motorcycle theory test gave me a disproportionate feeling of greatness.
 - That singular uncompromising nature I think is always quite attractive, not just for an actor to play, we’re attracted to uncompromising people whether they’re nice or not, because they’re 3D, they’re solid, you can define them, it’s not wishy washy.
 - If a scene is three pages long, quite often people break it up and do a page, say ‘cut’ then move on to the next bit, they do it in cuts. I don’t really like doing that; I like to go through it all in one organic run, then give notes afterward. A little bit more like theater.
 - I’m probably more dangerous in a car than I am on a motorbike; on a bike I’m very mindful of the fact that if you make a mistake you’re dead.
 - I love going to art galleries. The Tate Modern is one of my favourite things to do. But I don’t invest in the history of it and I don’t read up on it. I am a guy who would buy a print rather than buy an original.
 - I look at the Christian Bale movies, the ‘Batman’ films, and that shows you that superhero movies don’t just have to be about men in tights.
 - People come up to me and they’re usually nice, but as it goes on you realise that some people aren’t nice. Some people are not nice at all.
 - I think the most romantic thing you can do is just turn up. Turn up when its difficult for you. Travel halfway around the world or just up the road. Whatever it is, just be there.
 - I judge people very quickly.
 - Basically, every character I’ve ever played, I’ve based entirely on internal conflict. And I love doing that, because I think it’s very human.
 - The funny thing is, I’ve never really hurt myself in an action movie. I’ve done ‘Wanted,’ ‘X-Men,’ ‘Welcome To The Punch,’ even ‘Trance’ to a certain extent has little bits of action and stuff, but I’ve never really hurt myself at all – not even like a sprained ankle.
 - I wanted to be a missionary and work abroad, but girls started to become a bigger part of my life around the time I lost interest in the priesthood.

 - I’ve been in a few fights and I know what it’s like to get punched in the face.
 - Next year, if no one gives me any work, that’s fine. I’m not going to do well anyway. I’m not an actor, I’m just exploiting this industry.
 - I love Christmas. I never used to. I didn’t hate it, but I could take it or leave it. But, as I got to the age of 25 or 26, Christmas became quite a big deal, and I love it now. I love the food, and I love sharing time with people.
 - I try to keep my life low key, and I don’t like going to parties unless they’re thrown by a friend of mine, or they’re to do with a project I’m in, or it’s because I’ve been nominated for an award.
 - No movie has ever got enough time. It doesn’t matter how much money you’ve got, and it doesn’t matter how much money you’ve not got. You never finish on time. You’re always up against it and you’re always working up until the end.
 - I considered becoming a priest very seriously. I wanted to travel the world. By the time I turned 16, I realized I was only in it for selfish reasons. And, more importantly, I didn’t want to sacrifice the ladies!
 - I’m 5 foot 7, and I’ve got pasty white skin. I don’t think I’m ugly, don’t get me wrong, but I’m not your classic lead man, Brad Pitt guy.
 - I’ve done enough for a while and people get fed up of seeing you, but apart from that, although I’m young, I need a bit of rest. You could say I have become a house husband. It’s not a new man thing, it’s just largely a boring man who doesn’t mind staying in the house thing.
 - Marriage is an ongoing thing, man. You continue to work at it. But it’s joyful. And joyous. I don’t care if people are living without a marriage certificate. It’s just about people, in some way, saying to each other, ‘I commit to you. I will help you in this life.’
 - I’m taking probably the biggest risk of my career in playing the part in Filth. If you stop taking risks, then you get bored, or you just keep playing the same part, over and over again. Eventually audiences get bored of that, as well.
 - Playing somebody who’s obsessed. Playing somebody who is transgressing, and who is really crossing moral lines and ethical lines. That’s always interesting.
 - The minute you start to strategize too much, the more you start to think you’re in control of your own fate. And you’re not, really.
 - It’s weird when you’re watching yourself in a film – you can’t really detach yourself from the experiences you’ve had that day. You’re never watching the film as a proper punter.

 - I want to be like Matt Damon and do a hugely successful thinking-man’s action franchise like ‘Bourne.’

 - I wanted to be a doctor at one point and I also wanted to be a pilot. I think if you grow up in a dodgy area, reality often beats down those ambitions as you get older. But with me that never really happened.
 - That’s the main thing that attracts me – characters who have big journeys. I like playing those people.

 - I do find it strange, doing magazine shoots. Photographers always go, ‘Why don’t you like to have your picture taken? That’s what you do for a living anyway. Just pretend you’re acting. It’s the same thing!’
 - I kind of embarked on a fruitless search to find information about my character, Frederick Aiken. And it was fruitless, unfortunately, because there’s so little about him.

 - We’re in a horrible, repugnant place now where kids are told it’s their right and due to be hugely famous. Not good at their job, not good at anything, just hugely famous. This is not sane. Little girls think they’ll be famous if they have vast breast implants and might as well die if they don’t.
 - Shakespeare’s stories are still very strong. He structured fantastic stories about things that were fundamental to the human being and psyche.

 - I don’t know if anybody’s ever ready for another award season. It’s kind of like Christmas.
