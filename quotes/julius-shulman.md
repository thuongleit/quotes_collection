 - What good is a dream house if you haven’t got a dream?
 - The key to my work is that I stopped, physically, to observe something. I raised my camera and recorded my observations.
 - I’m not modest about myself. I know for a fact that I am good. But good in the sense that I can put things together. I expound vociferously to students of architecture and photography, the significance of design. A photograph is a design in which you assemble thoughts in your mind.
 - The camera is the least important element in photography.
