 - I meditate all the time. You know, I don’t sleep much – it’s a known fact that sleep is required more for the brain than the body because the brain needs sleep to dream. But I dream all the time. I dream when I’m awake, when I create work, with my eyes open. So who needs sleep?
 - We learn to love our sweat, we discover our passion to move and connect it to effort, we discover both the animal in us and the power of our imagination.
