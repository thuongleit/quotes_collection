 - Just be yourself and everything will fall in line, the way it’s supposed to be. If you’re yourself, that’s the best thing you can do, because you can never go “damn if I’d only been myself.” Live an authentic life and you don’t have to worry about your reputation.
 - I don’t give a damn about my reputation. You’re living in the past, it’s a new generation.
 - Success isn’t one straight line – it’s a ladder, and there’s always another rung above you to reach out for. Like anything else, there are ups and downs.
 - Something happens, you can’t even put your finger on it, and then you don’t quite feel the same way anymore. All of a sudden, there’s fights or something and you are going “who is this person?” I’ve seen this happen to other people and it has happened to me.
 - Can’t break free from the things that you do. I wanna walk, but I run back to you, that’s why I hate myself for loving you.

 - I left my family, and I left my brother and sister, and I went and lived my dream. I saw everybody, but is it ever enough?
 - Girls have got balls. They’re just a little higher up, that’s all.
 - Rock and roll by its nature is sexual. So girls playing rock and roll is saying to the world, “We own our sexuality.” I think that pop music is sort of about “you can do what you want to me” kind of energy, while rock and roll is “I’m going to do what I want to you” kind of energy.
 - You can never say never. I’m not sure if I even want to. I just don’t know. Some of it is just not able to be reached, you can’t remember some of it and the people that could help you remember have passed away. It might have to remain a remain.

 - Don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something. Make your own victories. Make your own mistakes.
 - I don’t pay attention. I don’t read stuff or message boards because you definitely get affected. You can read a hundred great comments, amazing comments, and have one bad one and that is all you can focus on and it wrecks your day. It says something about negativity and how it draws us somehow.
 - The media says that equality for women has arrived, but if you look around, you still don’t see girls playing guitars and having success with it.
 - The thing I get out of it is the connection. I remember going to shows as a kid and meeting eyes with the people in the band, and knowing they are meeting eyes with you, and that moment, that smile, and that’s your moment. I want to create millions of little moments for other people.
 - You want to have butterflies in your stomach, because if you don’t, if you walk out onstage complacent, that’s not a good thing.

 - It’s easier to sit there and say you don’t like feminists because they don’t have a sense of humor.
 - I don’t know if I miss it per se, but I do miss the fact that there just doesn’t seem to be any rock ‘n’ roll out there anyplace. Everything does seem kind of tame. It’s even hard in Manhattan to go out and find a good band to go see.
 - Other people will call me a rebel, but I just feel like I’m living my life and doing what I want to do. Sometimes people call that rebellion, especially when you’re a woman.
 - Obviously, some people are thick, and they’re not gonna see what they don’t want to see.

 - I learned how to scream from Marc Bolan.
 - A lot of the touring stuff has become a drag. Traveling itself is a drag. Anyone who’s been to an airport knows that.

 - People are very sincere in their praise, and you can’t take it lightly.

 - You follow any family around, you’re going to see elation, you’re going to see disharmony.
 - You know I don’t care if the world thinks I’m smart or not.
 - I started The Runaways with Sandy West. We shared the dream of girls playing rock and roll. Sandy was an exuberant and powerful drummer. So underrated, she was the caliber of John Bonham. I am overcome from the loss of my friend. I always told her, we changed the world.
 - I know music is subjective.
 - The only good thing you ever said was goodbye.
 - I’ve been able to do a lot of things a lot of people haven’t, that other people would dream of. I’ve been able to live out my fantasies, and dreams! So, I’m real lucky.

 - I think the one-on-one gigs connecting with the fans – is the most important thing. That will help build your fan base. They’ll talk about you, and word spreads. Those things are just as important as knowing how to play an E chord.

 - I don’t really care if you think I’m strange – I ain’t gonna change!

 - And you have a record company behind it, this is a key too, you need people to fight for your records, at least a little bit. So if you have a great song, it’s catchy, and you’ve got a little bit of help, I think that’s all you need. But there hasn’t been that in music.

 - People don’t want to see women doing things they don’t think women should do.

 - To be so superfocused and honed in on one thing can be good because then you get what you’re supposed to get done, done but you also miss out on other things. I could have spent more time with my family, and a million other little things.

 - I’ve done some acting and a lot of different things, but mostly it’s the music.

 - If you are having trouble making a chord, get a book, that is how I learned. There are guitar tuning apps so you can tune your guitar, and just learn how to play along with your records. And it’s great to be able to play along with another musician. That is like trial by fire.
