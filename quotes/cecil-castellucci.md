 - Silent is the ruined land. Man is brutal and the rain does not wash away the pain or rid the distant memory. It makes it glisten.
 - I smile a lot. I heard someone say once that it takes fewer muscles to smile than to frown, so i’m trying it out.

 - Sometimes my feelings get so big that I just want to swim out into the darkness. Just jump off the end of the world. Sometimes I want to dig, right down to the bones of everything. Sometimes when you dig, you dig up stuff you might not want to find. But that’s where the good stuff lies.
 - It’s a fact of life. Hearts are always hurting. And yet they still keep pumping.
 - Everyone got older but forgot to grow up.

 - It was amazing what I could remember about myself when I retraced my own steps.
