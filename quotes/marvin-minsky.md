 - You don’t understand anything until you learn it more than one way.
 - Artificial intelligence is the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men.
 - Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children.
 - Logic doesn’t apply to the real world.
 - I believed in realism, as summarized by John McCarthy’s comment to the effect that if we worked really hard, we’d have an intelligent system in from four to four hundred years.
 - We must see that music theory is not only about music, but about how people process it. To understand any art, we must look below its surface into the psychological details of its creation and absorption.
 - Societies need rules that make no sense for individuals. For example, it makes no difference whether a single car drives on the left or on the right. But it makes all the difference when there are many cars!
 - We’ll show you that you can build a mind from many little parts, each mindless by itself.
 - If we understood something just one way, we would not understand it at all.
 - An ethicist is someone who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind.
 - The brain happens to be a meat machine.
 - The secret of what anything means to us depends on how we’ve connected it to all the other things we know. That’s why it’s almost always wrong to seek the “real meaning” of anything. A thing with just one meaning has scarcely any meaning at all.
 - There was a failure to recognize the deep problems in AI; for instance, those captured in Blocks World. The people building physical robots learned nothing.
 - It’s ridiculous to live 100 years and only be able to remember 30 million bytes. You know, less than a compact disc. The human condition is really becoming more obsolete every minute.
 - This is a tricky domain because, unlike simple arithmetic, to solve a calculus problem – and in particular to perform integration – you have to be smart about which integration technique should be used: integration by partial fractions, integration by parts, and so on.
 - We wanted to solve robot problems and needed some vision, action, reasoning, planning, and so forth. We even used some structural learning, such as was being explored by Patrick Winston.
 - The principal activities of brains are making changes in themselves.
 - No computer has ever been designed that is ever aware of what it’s doing; but most of the time, we aren’t either.
 - Minds are simply what brains do.
 - Eventually, robots will make everything.
 - Imagine what it would be like if TV actually were good. It would be the end of everything we know.
 - Common sense is not a simple thing. Instead, it is an immense society of hard-earned practical ideas – of multitudes of life-learned rules and exceptions, dispositions and tendencies, balances and checks.
 - When David Marr at MIT moved into computer vision, he generated a lot of excitement, but he hit up against the problem of knowledge representation; he had no good representations for knowledge in his vision systems.
 - Daniel Dennett is our best current philosopher. He is the next Bertrand Russell. Unlike traditional philosophers, Dan is a student of neuroscience, linguistics, artificial intelligence, computer science, and psychology. He’s redefining and reforming the role of the philosopher.
 - Within 10 years computers won’t even keep us as pets.
 - Everything, including that which happens in our brains, depends on these and only on these: A set of fixed, deterministic laws.
 - Anyone could learn Lisp in one day, except that if they already knew Fortran, it would take three days.
 - What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle.
 - Speed is what distinguishes intelligence. No bird discovers how to fly: evolution used a trillion bird-years to ‘discover’ that–where merely hundreds of person-years sufficed.
 - I bet the human brain is a kludge.
 - Listening to music engages the previously acquired personal knowledge of the listener.
 - All intelligent problem solvers are subject to the same ultimate constraints – limitations on space, time, and materials.
 - There are three basic approaches to AI: Case-based, rule-based, and connectionist reasoning.
 - It would be as useless to perceive how things ‘actually look’ as it would be to watch the random dots on untuned television screens.
 - We rarely recognize how wonderful it is that a person can traverse an entire lifetime without making a single really serious mistake – like putting a fork in one’s eye or using a window instead of a door.
 - To say that the universe exists is silly, because it says that the universe is one of the things in the universe. So there’s something wrong with questions like, “What caused the Universe to exist?”
 - But the big feature of human-level intelligence is not what it does what it is works but what it does when it’s stuck.
 - But just as astronomy succeeded astrology, following Kepler’s discovery of planetary regularities, the discoveries of these many principles in empirical explorations of intellectual processes in machines should lead to a science, eventually.
 - Everything is similar if you’re willing to look far out of focus.
 - What would a Martian visitor think to see a human being laugh? It must look truly horrible: the sight of furious gestures, flailing limbs, and thorax heaving in frenzied contortions...
 - In general, we’re least aware of what our minds do best.
 - Once the computers got control, we might never get it back. We would survive at their sufferance. If we’re lucky, they might decide to keep us as pets.
 - One can acquire certainty only by amputating inquiry.
 - In science, one learns the most by studying what seems to be the least.
 - We turn to quantities when we can’t compare the qualities of things.
 - General fiction is pretty much about ways that people get into problems and screw their lives up. Science fiction is about everything else.
 - Computer languages of the future will be more concerned with goals and less with procedures specified by the programmer.
 - Kubrick’s vision seemed to be that humans are doomed, whereas Clarke’s is that humans are moving on to a better stage of evolution.
 - How many processes are going on, to keep that teacup level in your grasp? There must be a hundred of them.
 - Our present culture may be largely shaped by this strange idea of isolating children’s thought from adult thought. Perhaps the way our culture educates its children better explains why most of us come out as dumb as they do, than it explains how some of us come out as smart as they do.
 - By the way, it was his simulations that helped out in Jurassic Park – without them, there would have been only a few dinosaurs. Based on his techniques, Industrial Light and Magic could make whole herds of dinosaurs race across the screen.
 - Good theories of the mind must span at least three different scales of time: slow, for the billions of years in which our brains have survivied; fast, for the fleeting weeks and months of childhood; and in between, the centuries of growth of our ideas through history.
 - Experience has shown that science frequently develops most fruitfully once we learn to examine the things that seem the simplest, instead of those that seem the most mysterious.
