 - Grit is the stubborn refusal to quit.

 - Every creative story is different. And every creative story is the same. There was nothing. Now there is something. It’s almost like magic.
 - We need to be willing to risk embarrassment, ask silly questions, surround ourselves with people who don’t know what we’re talking about. We need to leave behind the safety of our expertise.
 - People assume that they perceive reality as it is, that our senses accurately record the outside world. Yet the science suggests that, in important ways, people experience reality not as it is, but as they expect it to be.
 - Creativity is a catchall term for a variety of distinct thought processes.
 - Creativity is a spark. It can be excruciating when we’re rubbing two rocks together and getting nothing. And it can be intensely satisfying when the flame catches and a new idea sweeps around the world.

 - The imagination is unleashed by constraints. You break out of the box by stepping into shackles.
 - The inconsistency of genius is a consistent theme of creativity.
 - Like a work of art, we exceed our materials. Science needs art to frame the mystery, but art needs science so that not everything is a mystery. Neither truth alone is our solution, for our reality exists in plural.
 - It is ironic but true: the one reality science cannot reduce is the only reality we will ever know. This is why we need art. By expressing our actual experience, the artist reminds us that our science is incomplete, that no map of matter will ever explain the immateriality of our consciousness.
 - For too long, we’ve assumed that there is a single template for human nature, which is why we diagnose most deviations as disorders. But the reality is that there are many different kinds of minds. And that’s a very good thing.
 - A lie told well is just as good as the truth.

 - Knowledge can be a subtle curse. When we learn about the world, we also learn all the reasons why the world cannot be changed. We get used to our failures and imperfections. We become numb to the possibilities of something new.
 - Children can’t help but create: they need to put their mind on the page, they want to paint, to sculpt, to write short stories.
 - Just because an idea is true doesn’t mean it can be proved. And just because an idea can be proved doesn’t mean it’s true.
