 - The happiest people spend much time in a state of flow – the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.
 - Flow is being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz.

 - It is when we act freely, for the sake of the action itself rather than for ulterior motives, that we learn to become more than what we were.
 - It is essential to learn to enjoy life. It really does not make sense to go through the motions of existence if one does not appreciate as much of it as possible.
 - Knowing oneself is not so much a question of discovering what is present in one’s self, but rather the creation of who one wants to be.
 - If we are so rich, why aren’t we happy?

 - One cannot lead a life that is truly excellent without feeling that one belongs to something greater and more permanent than oneself.
 - To be creative, a person has to internalize the entire system that makes creativity possible. Creative individuals are remarkable for their ability to adapt to almost any situation and to make do with whatever is at hand to reach their goals.
 - Repeatedly we question the necessity of our actions and evaluate critically the reasons for carrying them out. But in flow there is no need to reflect, because the action carries us forward as if by magic.
 - People generally report higher levels of stress, depression, and tension after watching TV. It seems that TV’s main virtue is that it occupies the mind undemandingly.
 - Optimal experience is that rare occasion when we feel a sense of exhilaration, a deep sense of enjoyment that is long cherished and that becomes a landmark in memory for what life should be like.
 - It is better to look suffering straight in the eye, acknowledge and respect it’s presence, and then get busy as soon as possible focusing on things we choose to focus on.
 - It is by being fully involved with every detail of our lives, whether good or bad, that we find happiness, not by trying to look for it directly.

 - If you do anything well, it becomes enjoyable. To keep enjoying something, you need to increase its complexity.
 - Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person’s capacity to act.
 - The task is to learn how to enjoy everyday life without diminishing other people’s chances to enjoy theirs.
 - Contrary to what most of us believe, happiness does not simply happen to us. It’s something that we make happen, and it results from doing our best. Feeling fulfilled when we live up to our potentialities is what motivates differentiation and leads to evolution.
 - Take charge of your schedule. Make time for reflection and relaxation.
 - For better or worse, our future will be determined in large part by our dreams and by the struggle to make them real.
 - Most enjoyable activities are not natural; they demand an effort that initially one is reluctant to make. But once the interaction starts to provide feedback to the person’s skills, it usually begins to be intrinsically rewarding.
 - Competition is enjoyable only when it is a means to perfect one’s skills; when it becomes an end in itself, it ceases to be fun.
 - If we agree that the bottom line of life is happiness, not success, then it makes perfect sense to say that it is the journey that counts, not reaching the destination.
 - Getting control of life is never easy, and sometimes it can be definitely painful.
 - For a person to become deeply involved in any activity it is essential that he knows precisely what tasks he must accomplish, moment by moment.
 - Competition is an easy way to get into flow.
 - It is as if evolution has built a safety device in our nervous system that allows us to experience full happiness only when we are living at 100%-when we are fully using the physical and mental equipment we have been given.
 - Some individuals have developed such strong internal standards that they no longer need the opinion of others to judge whether they have performed a task well or not. The ability to give objective feedback to oneself is in fact the mark of the expert.
 - If we know what that set point is, we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow, and it will be when your challenges are higher than average and skills are higher than average.
 - Develop what you lack.
 - The mood state Americans are in, on average, when watching television is mildly depressed.

 - Often we don’t have a good notion of what our talents are, because we have never had a chance to try them out.
 - To gain control over the quality of experience, one needs to learn how to build enjoyment into what happens day in, day out.
 - To be successful you have to enjoy doing your best while at the same time contributing to something beyond yourself.
 - But shortcuts are dangerous; we cannot delude ourselves that our knowledge is further along than it actually is.
 - Socializing is more positive than being alone, that’s why meetings are so popular. People don’t like being alone. That would be, however, an important skill to learn...
 - Flow is hard to achieve without effort. Flow is not ’wasting time.
 - If you are interested in something, you will focus on it, and if you focus attention on anything, it is likely that you will become interested in it. Many of the things we find interesting are not so by nature, but because we took the trouble of paying attention to them.

 - As long as we respond predictably to what feels good and what feels bad, it is easy for others to exploit our preferences for their own ends.

 - A person who forgoes the use of his symbolic skills is never really free.
 - It does not seem to be true that work necessarily needs to be unpleasant. It may always have to be hard, or at least harder than doing nothing at all. But there is ample evidence that work can be enjoyable, and that indeed, it is often the most enjoyable part of life.

 - The rules themselves are clear enough, and within everyone’s reach. But many forces, both within ourselves and in the environment, stand in the way. It is a little like trying to lose weight: everyone knows what it takes, everyone wants to do it, yet it is next to impossible for so many.
