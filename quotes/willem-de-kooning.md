 - Content is a glimpse of something, an encounter like a flash. It’s very tiny – very tiny. Content.
 - I’m not interested in ‘abstracting’ or taking things out or reducing painting to design, form, line, and color. I paint this way because I can keep putting more things in it – drama, anger, pain, love, a figure, a horse, my ideas about space. Through your eyes it again becomes an emotion or idea.
 - Flesh was the reason why oil painting was invented.
 - In art, one idea is as good as another. If one takes the idea of trembling, for instance, all of a sudden most art starts to tremble. Michelangelo starts to tremble. El Greco starts to tremble. All the Impressionists start to tremble.

 - Yes, I am influenced by everbody. But every time I put my hands in my pockets I find someone else’s fingers there.

 - Once, after finishing a picture, I thought I would stop for awhile, take a trip, do things-the next time I thought of this, I found five years had gone by.
 - Not even for a million dollars would I paint a tree.
 - The texture of experience is prior to everything else.
 - The drawings that interest me most are made with closed eyes. With eyes closed, I feel my hand slide down on the paper. I have an image in mind, but the results always surprise me.
 - I paint the way I do because I can keep on putting more and more things in – like drama, pain, anger, love, a figure, a horse, my ideas of space. It doesn’t matter if it differs from mine, as long as it comes from the painting, which has its own integrity and intensity.

 - The idea of space is given to the artist to change if he can. The subject matter in the abstract is space.
 - In art one idea is as good as another.
 - Every so often, a painter has to destroy painting. Cezanne did it, Picasso did it with Cubism. Then Pollock did it. He busted our idea of a picture all to hell. Then there could be new paintings again.
