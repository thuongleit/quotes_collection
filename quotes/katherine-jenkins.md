 - I am a perfectionist.
 - I’m a Cancerian, the typical crab with the tough outer shell and the soft bit in the middle. I don’t think I’ll ever come to terms with people being unnecessarily nasty, but I can take it if someone doesn’t like my music – I’m not everyone’s cup of tea.
 - When I dance, I forget everything else and just feel completely happy.
 - Children should be able to live a life free from bullying and harassment and it is time that we all took a stand against this.
 - I sing a mixture of everything from opera, folk music, Broadway. It’s a mix of things.
 - If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I’m a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.
 - My mother and father were perfect role models. They were together for 25 years and very much in love. But I’ve got too much to do now. I’m only 27.
 - In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I’ve been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.
 - I want to have kids. I want to get married. That is still very important to me.
 - I do feel as if I’m living a blessed life at the moment. I’ve been thinking about the phrase ‘living a dream,’ because that’s exactly what is happening. I’m just trying to go with the flow and take each day as it comes, otherwise I might freak out at all the things that have happened recently.
 - I have to believe that I know what’s best for me. For instance, I choose all my songs. I never record anything I don’t want to record. No one tells me what concerts to do.
 - You learn your lessons from the mistakes you make, not the things you achieve.
 - I love coming back to Neath – this is home and always will be.
 - I did once shatter a chandelier. I was singing with my college choir in Wales. I was the soloist and I hit the high note and there was this massive bang and all this glass came down from the ceiling. I’d like that to be my party trick if I can perfect it.
 - My idol was Marilyn Monroe, who was a size 16, I think, and curvy in all the right places. I will never be stick thin. I remember a shoot where I had to get into these tiny hot pants, and I thought, ‘God, I wish I hadn’t eaten.’
 - Yes. I do about 70 shows a year, in the past year I’ve been to Italy, Australia, Japan, China, just about everywhere. I do it because I love singing. The money is a bonus.
 - People see you sing in a certain way, in a long dress, and you are put on a pedestal like you have never made a mistake in your life.
 - I’d love to play Carmen – it’s the perfect mezzo role.
 - I really see myself as a homegirl. Wales is my first home. London is my second home – I’ve been there 14 years now.
 - I am fussy, about my diet and straining my voice. I know, sounds a bit over the top. But I’m not as bad as I used to be. These days I don’t drink alcohol for five days before a show – very dehydrating for the vocal cords, and all that acid reflux. I used to ban it for a fortnight. Nightmare.
 - I’m over the moon to be involved in the ‘Doctor Who’ Christmas special. I can’t quite believe it as it’s a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever.
 - At the weekend, one of the paparazzi left their lunch box filled with half-eaten pasta salad on my doorstep: it was like a little warning, you know? ‘We have been here.’

 - I’m not naturally a person that wants to exercise, but I find running is something I can do wherever I am in the world.
 - People perceive opera and classical as elitist – I disagree. I’ve always tried to mix the two, make it more accessible.
 - I’m launching my own festival in South Wales. It’s something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. It’s going to be held at Margam Park, because I wanted the venue to be as close to my home as possible.
 - Marilyn Monroe was supposedly a size 16, which is probably why I love her style; it suits me better.
 - Being a question on ‘The Weakest Link,’ that was quite a moment.
 - I was such a geek in school.
 - Confidence is one of the sexiest things.
 - I go home and don’t get treated any differently. People have known me all my life and are interested and very supportive but because they have known me forever I don’t get any diva treatment. My mum still tells me off if I haven’t loaded the dishwasher for her.
 - Everything in my career is my decision – every picture, every outfit. You get one chance at this, and I never saw myself as being a puppet.
 - I can’t leave the studio until everything is as it should be. And I can’t put a record out unless I am completely happy with it. I never want to be at a signing and hear my album playing and think, ‘Oh no, I could have done that top note better.’
 - I do not understand where the idea came from that opera is only for privileged people, I am as happy singing before 70,000 people at the Millennium Stadium, as I am in front of a few hundred in a small concert hall.
 - I always choose songs that I have an emotional connection to, and I often feel myself getting very emotional when I sing.
 - I would absolutely, definitely never sell my wedding pictures to a magazine. I’d like it to be a special day, not a photo shoot. And once you’ve done that, your marriage becomes everybody else’s business.
 - I’ve been lucky that I’ve performed with a lot of the classical people I’ve wanted to work with so I’d like to do something that people didn’t see coming. Like Madonna, or being Welsh – the Tom Jones thing. Or somebody suggested N-Dubz – that would be brilliant!
