 - To give somebody your time is the biggest gift you can give.
 - The secret is to just keep moving.
 - I think I’m a really good partner and very sensitive to the other person’s feelings. I want somebody else to be comfortable, to understand about my job, and if they want to come on a set and see me work, they always can.
 - I think working with Johnny Depp was very intimidating. It was my fault though. I mean he’s a total cool nice, nice guy, but I was just so, I don’t know, overpowered by his presence. Like he’s a very mystic person. He’s older so I never really warmed up around him. I was so stiff.
 - As the audience, I always love to get to a point where, surprisingly, I find myself in a secret friendship allegiance with the characters that are unexpected.
 - I’m so uncomfortable, especially in emotional situations, having to say sentences that don’t feel right. As an actor – or really, as any kind of person sensitive to it.
 - I used to be very afraid of flying. It would creep me out and make me very tense and very uncomfortable, and I would sweat or even cry. I was very, very scared of dying, but I’m not anymore. Fears need to be indulged, in order to exist. I don’t have much time to indulge in any fears.
 - If you ever get really dressed up for a party, you get a feeling from the reactions of people that you don’t need to be that loud. It’s the same when you act. You have to always consider what’s around you and the texture of things and try to meld in with what’s going on.
 - I never consciously said, ‘I want to be an actor.’ It sounds stupid, but it’s kind of like being a painter or something. You don’t say, ‘From today on I’m going to be a painter.’ It’s not something conscious – you’ve just been painting pictures all your life.
 - I don’t really care where I work, actually, because you know making a movie is like living in movie world. There’s such a secluded world, and the director is the king ruling the country, and everybody’s building this little town to speak in symbolism.
 - Difference is always the biggest challenge for humans. That’s why we do enjoy reading or watching movies or watching TV. It’s a personal challenge to get close to people that we never get close to.

 - Television in America is so elaborate. There are so many remote cranes, and they have all the toys to play with. The directors are really good. They really work with you. So, I’m not really on set thinking, “Oh, my God, this is television. It’s very different.”
