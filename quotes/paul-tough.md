 - People high in conscientiousness get better grades in high school and college; they commit fewer crimes; and they stay married longer.
 - And in most highly academic environments in the United States, no one fails anything.
 - If we don’t give kids the opportunity to fail when they’re growing up, and to fail productively, to fail creatively, that they’re going to get out there into the world and they’re going to hit some kind of setback, like everybody does, and they’re going to get completely derailed.
