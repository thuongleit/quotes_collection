 - As we say in the sewer, if you’re not prepared to go all the way, don’t put your boots on in the first place.
 - My generation is having its midlife crisis in its 20s.
 - I’ve always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You’re trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that’s about so you can represent it.
 - I don’t smoke and I don’t want to smoke. I am not a fan of gratuitous smoking in films.
 - I just like working with smart people.
 - See, I don’t get the sense that you need to direct at all. Sometimes I get the opposite sensation from you, that you’re like, “I really should go do something else.” But then you are drawn back in by a particular story, like a hangnail in the brain.
 - I almost forgot what it’s like to be proud of my government.
 - I don’t think you should sit around and wait for people to give you an opportunity to express yourself or do your work, or whatever. Actors have to be producers and writers have to be producers.
 - The more you can create that magic bubble, that suspension of disbelief, for a while, the better.
 - I don’t have anything to prove to anybody, which is a lovely place to be.
 - People think because I went to Yale that that implies privilege, and it is a privilege in the sense that it’s an incredible opportunity.
 - When people come together too young, they try to become one person. As you get older, you realize that you don’t want to become one person because then you lose the person you are.
 - All people are paradoxical. No one is easily reducible, so I like characters who have contradictory impulses or shades of ambiguity. It’s fun, and it’s fun because it’s hard.
 - As an actor, I don’t have any politics. As an actor, I’m driven more by an authentic – I would say an obsessive-compulsive-disorder level-fixation on mimicry, tonality of voice, to literally imitate something until I can just disappear into it.
 - To cite my own alma mater, it’s shocking to me that Yale University can teach what it teaches at the Yale School of Environmental Studies and utterly fail to mirror those values in any way in its investment practices.
 - It’s better for people to miss you than to have seen too much of you.
 - I studied French forever, and when do I ever speak French? I clearly should have studied Spanish. I wish I had stuck with music, because that would still be great. I really wish I had learned to surf earlier in my life.
 - I think that the environmental movement is wisely moving away from a largely emotion-based argument for the spiritual or intrinsic value of Nature with a capital “N” and evolving toward a very hard-nosed case for the economic value of natural capital, ecosystem services, biodiversity, etc.
 - Anybody who is running a marathon or doing a walkathon, doing a fundraiser for their school, their company, by far it’s guaranteed the easiest and most fun way to quickly set up a fundraising campaign and send it around to your friends and family.

 - Basically, I think 21st century conservation is moving toward preserving ecosystems by dealing with the needs of people.
 - The Zionist Tulsa Jew who’s pugnacious is a reality. I grew up around it. And I think it’s really, really funny and surprising and unlikely.
 - When I’m looking for Zen and I’m not saying this facetiously at all – I would really rather surf, scuba dive, or fly my plane. And, when I feel tension about the grind of work, it’s not getting the money to make films versus making films that constitutes the grind, it’s all this stuff.
 - I thought Rounders was a comic movie in its way. First time I directed a movie, I wanted to do a comedy. I don’t like things that are superficially one thing or another, mainly. My favorite comedies are really smart, too, and have a lot of levels to them as well.
 - Unpopular speech is absolutely vital to the health of our nation.
 - If I ever have to stop taking the subway, I’m gonna have a heart attack.
 - I don’t flatter myself – I’m not a scientist, I’m not a conservation expert.
 - I’ve already spent a lot of my life doing what makes me go. There’s a life out there while I’m still young, able to move, able to just sit at peace in the water – I should be spending much more time doing that, rather than continuing to go through this artistic struggle.
 - Identical twins are endemically alike in many ways.
 - The deeper you go with the character, the more you see the layers start to peel away. It’s more challenging to me, but it’s also just interesting. Those are the things I like to watch. I like to watch the evolutions of something.

 - I tend to have a kind of tunnel vision when I’m looking at an individual piece.
 - I knew Danny DeVito and he knew me, so he wanted me to try Death to Smoochy. I loved that stuff and had a great time doing it.

 - I grow tired of intelligence having such a limited manifestation in movies – “intelligence” usually meaning coastal, with a certain level of formal education.
 - You never make all things for all people and can’t always pander to the broadest denominator. I keep an eye toward doing the themes that interest me. Do they move me? Interest me? Make me think? When I run across something that is provocative in an unsettling way, it appeals to me.
 - It’s ginned up by the corporate plutocracy as a way of distracting the working-class people that it’s screwing. We hamstring our own natural progressivism in this country, and that’s really stupid.
 - Duality is not a story. Duality is just a complexity.
 - There’s a lot of romanticisation of the intuitive actor and method acting and all kinds of notions about getting inside a character and coming out from there.

 - I’ve always liked the idea of taking old dramatic ideas and devices and making them feel relevant or contemporary or whatever.
 - I had a huge advantage with Edward Norton because he’s directed a movie before, so one thing he appreciates is how hard my job is, he’s very sensitive to that. We actually ended up finishing “Leaves of Grass” a day early.
 - I start to get fixated on a story and a character and an idea, and at a certain point, I really want to do it. It’s a compulsion to explore a specific thing, as opposed to a compulsion to direct, generally speaking.
 - I have this embedded faith in the process through which films of a certain type get discovered on longer timelines.
 - Every little thing that people know about you as a person impedes your ability to achieve that kind of terrific suspension of disbelief that happens when an audience goes with an actor and character he’s playing.

 - The film industry needs to confront the physical footprint of the way films get made.

 - Practiced poorly, tourism can be extremely negative.
 - But work that’s got real substance does make people feel, “There’s someone else out there who relates to my experience, or who just helped me understand my own experience a little bit better.” And I think that’s still got enormous value.

 - I do subscribe to the maxim that generally comedy is like jazz. Either you get it or you don’t. You can’t learn it and you can’t be taught it. I don’t think that if you are not a funny person, you can fake it.
 - People say you can’t make movies about your politics or the environment. And, generally speaking, I completely divide those sides of my brain.
 - It must be good to be in Germany and France, because I have completely forgotten what it is like to be proud of your government.

 - I’m not particularly precious about the theatrical experience any more.
 - With Edward Norton you’d never say, “This is the one we’re going with whether you like it or not.” It has to be agreed upon.
 - I’m pretty busy in my life and I’m very aware of what it takes to direct a movie. It takes a lot out of you; it takes a lot out of the rest of your life, from other people in your life. I don’t lie around hungering for that consumption very often.

 - It’s dismaying to see the unilateralism that the government is doing.
 - There is a lot of interesting product coming to market already. Bags and bottles and cups and such made of potato starch and other fully biodegradable materials. In some sense, plastic is more chemically complex. We ought to be able to simplify.
