 - Looking at the sky last night and the moon in the first fresh dark, just a few stars, bright with their cold flares, I had a little crumpled thought, ‘Oh well, the moon. It’s just another place like California.’ One’s imagination drags its feet as we are inexorably hauled into the future.
 - Snow falling softly on lashes of eyes you love, and a cold cheek growing warm next to your own in hushed dark familial December.
 - It is always pleasant to learn that someone takes an interest in a work which one enjoyed writing.
 - However, if a poem can be reduced to a prose sentence, there can’t be much to it.

 - One tends to write beyond what’s needed.
