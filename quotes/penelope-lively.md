 - Language tethers us to the world; without it we spin like atoms.
 - We all need a past – that’s where our sense of identity comes from.

 - Getting to know someone else involves curiosity about where they have come from, who they are.
 - And in another year everything will be different yet again. It is always like that, and always will be; you are forever standing on the brink, in a place where you cannot see ahead; there is nothing of which to be certain except what lies behind. This should be terrifying, but somehow it is not.
 - I’m intrigued by the way in which physical appearance can often direct a person’s life; things happen differently for a beautiful woman than for a plain one.

 - If we had not met, that day, I think I would have imagined you somehow.

 - It seems to me that anyone whose library consists of a Kindle lying on a table is some sort of bloodless nerd.
 - The idea that memory is linear is nonsense. What we have in our heads is a collection of frames. As to time itself-can it be linear when all these snatches of other presents exist at once in your mind? A very elusive and tricky concept, time.
 - I have had to empty two family homes during the last few years – first, the house that had been my grandmothers since 1923, and then my own country home, which we had lived in for over twenty years.
 - In old age, you realise that while you’re divided from your youth by decades, you can close your eyes and summon it at will. As a writer it puts one at a distinct advantage.

 - I’ve always been fascinated by the operation of memory – the way in which it is not linear but fragmented, and its ambivalence.
 - I do like to embed a fictional character firmly in an occupation.
 - The consideration of change over the century is about loss, though I think that social change is gain rather than loss.
 - Equally, we require a collective past – hence the endless reinterpretations of history, frequently to suit the perceptions of the present.
 - I’m not an historian and I’m not wanting to write about how I perceive the social change over the century as a historian, but as somebody who’s walked through it and whose life has been dictated by it too, as all our lives are.
 - History unravels; circumstances, following their natural inclination, prefer to remain ravelled.
