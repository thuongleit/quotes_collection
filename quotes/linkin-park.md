 - And when you’re feeling empty, keep me memory, and leave out all the rest, leave out all the rest.
 - I want to find something I’ve wanted all along Somewhere I belong.
 - Waiting for the end to come, Wishing I had strength to stand, This is not what I had planned, It’s out of my control.
 - It’s easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It’s so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone.
 - Even those who never frown eventually break down.
 - But trying to be genuine was harder than it seemed.
 - Memories consume Like opening the wound I’m picking me apart again You all assume I’m safe here in my room Unless I try to start again.
 - It’s harder starting over, than never to have changed.
 - Don’t want to reach for me, do you? I mean nothing to you, the little things give you away.
