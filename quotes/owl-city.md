 - I’d rather pick flowers instead of fights.
 - I’ll watch the night turn light blue, it’s not the same without you cause it takes two to whisper quietly.
 - As many times as I blink I’ll think of you tonight.
 - The silence isn’t so bad, till I look at my hands and feel sad. Because the spaces between my fingers are right where yours fit perfectly.
 - When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love? All the time, all the time.
 - I’d rather waltz than just walk through the forest The trees keep the tempo and they sway in time Quartet of crickets chime in for the chorus If I were to pluck on your heartstrings, would you strum on mine?
 - Please take a long, hard look at your textbook, cause I’m history.
 - I’ve been sleeping with the night light unplugged With a note on the rocking chair It says I’m dreaming of the life I once loved So wake me if you’re out there.
