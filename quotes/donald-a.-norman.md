 - Beauty and brains, pleasure and usability – they should go hand in hand.
 - When a device as simple as a door has to come with an instruction manual – even a one-word manual – then it is a failure, poorly designed.
 - Knowing how people will use something is essential.
 - It is not enough that we build products that function, that are understandable and usable, we also need to build products that bring joy and excitement, pleasure and fun, and, yes, beauty to people’s lives.
 - Attractive things work better.
 - In the university, professors make up artificial problems. In the real world, the problems do not come in nice, neat packages. They have to be discovered.
 - To me, error analysis is the sweet spot for improvement.
 - I’m not a fan of technology. I’m a fan of pedagogy, of understanding how people learn and the most effective learning methods. But technology enables some exciting changes.
 - Academics get paid for being clever, not for being right.
 - A challenge to the designers of the world: Make signs unnecessary.
 - We expert teachers know that motivation and emotional impact are what matter.
 - Go to the bookstore and look at how many bookshelves are filled with books trying to explain how to work the devices. We don’t see shelves of books on how to use television sets, telephones, refrigerators or washing machines. Why should we for computer-based applications?
 - We are victims of our own success. We have let technology lead the way, pushing ever faster to newer, faster, and more powerful systems, with nary a moment to rest, contemplate, and to reflect upon why, how, and for whom all this energy has been expended.
 - Market segmentation s a natural result of the vast differences among people.
 - User-centered design means working with your users all throughout the project.
 - Good design is also an act of communication between the designer and the user, except that all the communication has to come about by the appearance of the device itself. The device must explain itself.
 - When you have trouble with things – whether it’s figuring out whether to push or pull a door or the arbitrary vagaries of the modern computer and electronics industries – it’s not your fault. Don’t blame yourself: blame the designer.
 - And to get real work experience, you need a job, and most jobs will require you to have had either real work experience or a graduate degree.
 - Simplification is as much in the mind as it is in the device.
 - Only the most sophisticated of beings can lie and cheat, and get away with it.
 - Behavioral design is all about feeling in control. Includes: usability, understanding, but also the feel.
 - Simplicity design axiom: The complexity of the information appliance is that of the task, not the tool. The technology is invisible.
 - So what does a good teacher do? Create tension – but just the right amount.
 - Creeping featurism is a disease, fatal if not treated promptly. There are some cures, but, as usual, the best approach is to practice preventative medicine.
 - If people keep buying poorly designed products, manufacturers and designers will think they are doing the right thing and continue as usual.
 - Design is really an act of communication, which means having a deep understanding of the person with whom the designer is communicating.
 - If you’re more susceptible to interruption, you do more out of the box thinking.
 - Change the attitude toward errors. Think of an object’s user as attempting to do a task, getting there by imperfect approximations. Don’t think of the user as making errors; think of the actions as approximations of what is desired.
 - If you think the products don’t match what you want from a product, don’t buy it.
 - Forget the complaints against complexity; instead, complain about confusion.
 - The best kind of design isn’t necessarily an object, a space, or a structure: it’s a process- dynamic and adaptable.
 - You won’t catch me giving clear lectures.
 - Innocence lost is not easily regained. The designer simply cannot predict the problems people will have, the misinterpretations that will arise, and the errors that will get made.
 - The designer has an obligation to provide an appropriate conceptual model for the way that the device works. It doesn’t have to completely accurate but it has to be sufficiently accurate that it will help in both the learning of the operation and also dealing with novel situations.
 - The major problems facing the development of products that are safer, less prone to error, and easier to use and understand are not technological: they are social and organizational.
 - Rule of thumb: if you think something is clever and sophisticated beware-it is probably self-indulgence.
 - The argument is not between adding features and simplicity, between adding capability and usability. The real issue is about design: designing things that have the power required for the job while maintaining understandabili ty, the feeling of control, and the pleasure of accomplishment.
 - As the technology matures, it becomes less and less relevant. The technology is taken for granted. Now, new customers enter the marketplace, customers who are not captivated by technology, but who instead want reliability, convenience, no fuss or bother, and low cost.
 - The problem with emotion was that it was clearly something important, but-at least according to the old philosophy-it was something to overcome.
 - I prefer design by experts – by people who know what they are doing.
 - Having the best product means nothing if the people won’t buy it.
 - How do you discover a need that nobody yet knows about? This is where the product breakthroughs come through.
 - The current paradigm is so thoroughly established that the only way to change is to start over again.
 - It was always amusing to be inside Apple and read what journalists said we were doing.
 - A big ethical question is what happens after people stop using the device. Does it degrade the environment? Could it have been designed so it would actually be good for the environment?
 - A good designer will actually design the company.
 - Scientists are always skeptics.
 - Learning should take place when it is needed, when the learner is interested, not according to some arbitrary, fixed schedule.
 - Readers always seem to think that the author has some control over the design of their books.
 - People Propose, Science Studies, Technology Conforms.
 - Attractive things work better When you wash and wax a car, it drives better, doesn’t it? Or at least feels like it does.
 - Also note that invariably when we design something that can be used by those with disabilities, we often make it better for everyone.
 - The design of everyday things is in great danger of becoming the design of superfluous, overloaded, unnecessary things.
 - I believe that robots should only have faces if they truly need them.
 - It is the duty of machines and those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.
 - Computer scientists have so far worked on developing powerful programming languages that make it possible to solve the technical problems of computation. Little effort has gone toward devising the languages of interaction.
 - In the consumer economy taste is not the criterion in the marketing of expensive soft drinks, usability is not the primary criterion in the marketing of home and office appliances. We are surrounded with objects of desire, not objects of use.
 - Any time you see signs or labels added to a device, it is an indication of bad design: a simple lock should not require instructions.
 - Complexity is acceptable as long as it is intelligible and necessary. We want to avoid needless complications.
 - In my opinion, no single design is apt to be optimal for everyone.
 - I believe that the Apple Shuffle is an excellent compromise among the conflicting requirements of simplicity, elegance, size, battery life, and function.
 - AS for all those mistakes I make – they are on purpose – to teach you how to deal with them.
 - It is relatively easy to design for the perfect cases, when everything goes right, or when all the information required is available in proper format.
 - I’ve been looking at the iPod- the Apple iPod. One of the interesting things about the iPod, one of the things that people love most about it is not the technology; it’s the box it comes in.
 - Everyday people are not very good designers.
 - Am I an Apple bigot? No. I can critique their products and their customer service philosophy. But overall, they do better than any other player.
 - What makes something simple or complex? It’s not the number of dials or controls or how many features it has: It is whether the person using the device has a good conceptual model of how it operates.
 - I think there is a tendency in science to measure what is measurable and to decide that what you cannot measure must be uninteresting.
 - The designer shouldn’t think of a simple dichotomy between errors and correct behavior; rather, the entire interaction should be treated as a cooperative endeavor between person and machine, one in which misconceptions can arise on either side.
 - Our information lives will be better served when we are free to get to our information from wherever we are, with any device available.
 - Isn’t one of your first exercises in learning how to communicate to write a description of how to tie your shoelaces? The point being that it’s basically impossible to use text to show that.
