 - Certainty is the enemy of change.
 - In all cultures, the family imprints its members with selfhood. Human experience of identity has two elements; a sense of belonging and a sense of being separate. The laboratory in which these ingredients are mixed and dispensed is the family, the matrix of identity.

 - The touchstone for family life is still the legendary ‘and so they were married and lived happily ever after.’ It is no wonder that any family falls short of this ideal.
 - I describe family values as responsibility towards others, increase of tolerance, compromise, support, flexibility. And essentially the things I call the silent song of life-the continuous process of mutual accommodation without which life is impossible.
