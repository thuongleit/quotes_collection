 - No man is obliged to be what he might have been.
 - Bystanders wandered in and out of the merchantâ€™s stall, passing the time, talking of dreams they might purchase. Workers and slaves stooped from labor asked timidly for dreams of wine and ease. Women asked for dreams of love, and men for dreams of women.
