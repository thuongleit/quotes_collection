 - That most delicious of all privileges – spending other people’s money.
 - I love liberty, I hate equality.

 - We ought to observe that practice which is the hardest of all-especially for young physicians-we ought to throw in no medicine at all-to abstain-to observe a wise and masterly inactivity.
