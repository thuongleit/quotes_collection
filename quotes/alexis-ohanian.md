 - It takes discipline not to let social media steal your time.
 - Nothing will replace good journalism.
 - Being effective at social media, whether for business or personal use, means capturing people who have short attention spans. They’re only a click away from a picture of a funny cat, so you have to make your thing more compelling than that cat. And that can be a high bar.
 - Facebook makes me hate the people I know, and Reddit makes me love the people I don’t.
 - The social-media landscape changes incredibly fast, so you have to be open-minded and nimble to keep up with it.
 - We don’t even realize something is broken until someone else shows us a better way.
 - The great thing about the Internet is, it’s the freest marketplace of ideas that there is.
 - Having that kind of endorsement and having Paul Graham’s readership coming to your site and contributing to it and building the foundation of the community was just a really invaluable way to start Reddit.
 - The weird thing about reddit is that, for a community its size – now I’m no longer at reddit, but the public traffic numbers that they put out are, I think with the site about eight million unique visitors a month, or every 30 days, which is a fairly big site.
 - We were very, very lucky being in the first round of Y Combinator because that alone generated a lot of interest. A lot of readers of Paul Graham were just excited to see what was going to come up. And we were the first ones to launch.
 - If you want to succeed, you’ve got to be okay to just lose control.
 - I like sarcasm. I like snark.
 - I guess if you include contractors that are six or seven people working on reddit, but when we got acquired there were basically three and then in the years since, we’ve added three more developer hires full time, and a community manger. But the site is still remarkably small.
 - There was a clear lesson here – and that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants.
 - If I were a snarky Reddit user though, I would say, hypothetically, that that would just be like reading Reddit’s Front Page a day later. But I’m not going to go there.
