 - A fair and just society offers equality of opportunity to all. But it cannot promise, and should not try to enforce, sameness.
 - You have to be literate in today’s world. We’re not going to get away with not teaching boys to read.
 - Boy’s natural play is rough and tumble play, it’s the universal play of little boys. And it’s very different from aggression. And we are a society that’s failing to understand the distinction.
