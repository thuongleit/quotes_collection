 - Follow the evidence wherever it leads, and question everything.
 - Science reveals that all life on Earth is one.
 - Everyone should have their mind blown once a day.

 - To learn more about science, turn off your electronic device and go outside and look around a bit. Nature is calling you. Go on. The internet will still be here.
 - If you’re scientifically literate, the world looks very different to you, and that understanding empowers you.
 - I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier. Not as something to be conquered but to be explored.
 - The remarkable feature of physical laws is that they apply everywhere, whether or not you choose to believe in them. After the laws of physics, everything else is opinion.
 - There is no greater education than one that is self-driven.

 - Give a kid a book, and you change the world. In a way, even the universe.
 - Science is a way of equipping yourself with the tools to interpret what happens in front of you.
 - Not only are we in the universe, the universe is in us. I don’t know of any deeper spiritual feeling than what that brings upon me.

 - The greatest of people that have ever been in society, they were never versions of someone else. They were themselves.
 - Down there between our legs, it’s like an entertainment complex in the middle of a sewage system. Who designed that?
 - Our five senses are faulty data-taking devices, and they need help.
 - The only way you can invent tomorrow is if you break out of the enclosure that the school system has provided for you by the exams written by people who are trained in another generation.
 - Why can’t we summon the ingenuity and courage of the generations that came before us? The dinosaurs never saw that asteroid coming. What’s our excuse?
 - For your own safety, do not ever tell an astrophysicist, I hope all your stars are twinkling.
 - No one is dumb who is curious.
 - Perhaps these ancient observatories like Stonehenge perennially impress modern people because modern people have no idea how the Sun, Moon, or stars move. We are too busy watching evening television to care what’s going on in the sky.
 - I think if everyone had the luxury to pursue a life of exactly what they love, we would all be ranked as visionaries and brilliant.
 - People like it when they understand something that they previously thought they couldn’t understand. It’s a sense of empowerment.
 - Does the full moon affect people’s behavior, you ask? Yup. It makes people think the full moon affects people’s behavior.
 - So maybe part of our formal education should be training in empathy. Imagine how different the world would be if, in fact, that were ‘reading, writing, arithmetic, empathy.’
 - Science is a philosophy of discovery. Intelligent design is a philosophy of ignorance. You cannot build a program of discovery on the assumption that nobody is smart enough to figure out the answer to a problem.
 - What are the lessons to be learned from this journey of the mind through the universe? That humans are emotionally fragile, perennially gullible, hopelessly ignorant masters of an insignificantly small speck in the cosmos. Have a nice day.
 - Scientific inquiry shouldn’t stop just because a reasonable explanation has apparently been found.
 - Extreme skepticism and extreme gullibility are two equal ways of not having to think at all. And I don’t think I’m the first to say that.
 - Quantum physics fluctuates all the time. But now the fluctuations are not just particles coming into and out of existence, which happens all the time. It’s whole universes coming into and out of existence.
 - My view is that if your philosophy is not unsettled daily then you are blind to all the universe has to offer.
 - We are star dust in the highest exalted way, called by the universe, reaching out to the universe.
 - What would aliens say when told earthlings shift clocks twice a year to fool themselves into thinking there’s more sunlight?
 - What I’m saying is, when different experiments give you the same result, it is no longer subject to your opinion. That’s the good thing about science: It’s true whether or not you believe in it. That’s why it works.
 - Our nation is turning into an idiocracy.
 - Society needs to see science not as a luxury of funding but as a fundamental activity that drives enlightenment, economics, and security.
 - Whenever people have used religious documents to make accurate predictions about our base knowledge of the physical world, they have been famously wrong.
 - As children we all wonder – we wonder all the time. And that gets lost in adulthood. It gets beaten out, it gets filtered out or diluted out.
 - I’m a little fatigued of adults saying we’ve got to worry about the kids. And these are the same adults that don’t know science and are running things and wielding resources and legislation.
 - Claiming there is no other life in the universe is like scooping up some water, looking at the cup and claiming there are no whales in the ocean.
 - In the animal kingdom, one of the keys to survival is to outwit your enemies. And when you’re surrounded by carnivores, one of the best strategies is to fade into the background and disappear.

 - Physics is the only profession in which prophecy is not only accurate but routine.
 - I’ve known from long ago that the universe was calling me. If you were one of those annoying adults that said, ‘Oh, what are you gonna be when you grow up?’ I would say, ‘Astrophysicist .’ And then they’d walk away real quickly.
 - In physics, opinions don’t matter, only demonstrated experiments. The day the fellow succeeds, if ever, he won’t need anybody else’s opinion.
 - Let us not fool ourselves into thinking we went to the Moon because we are pioneers, or discoverers, or adventurers. We went to the Moon because it was the militaristically expedient thing to do.
 - When you innovate, you create new industries that then boost your economy. And when you create new industries and that becomes part of your culture, your jobs can’t go overseas because no one else has figured out how to do it yet.
 - That is a big question we all have: are we alone in the universe? And exoplanets confirm the suspicion that planets are not rare.
 - Astronauts are the only kind of celebrity I know who can have a line of people waiting for their autograph, even if the line of people does not know in advance the astronaut’s name.
 - The typical person has no trouble believing without knowing. What people need to realize is simply that you do not need to believe to know.
 - I agree that we should go back to the moon and on to Mars. We should treat all objects in the solar system, including comets and asteroids, as exploration targets.
 - The first colony on Mars is not going to be built by a private company. How are you going to make money? You’re not.
 - You can make a stack high enough to reach the moon and back, and only then will you have used your 100 billion hamburgers. This is terrifying news to cows.
 - Like no other science, astrophysics cross-pollinate s the expertise of chemists, biologists, geologists and physicists, all to discover the past, present, and future of the cosmos-and our humble place within it.
 - I don’t want to go into space because of war. I think we would if it was triggered. If China said they want to put military bases on Mars, we’d be at Mars in two years. That would be quick. I don’t want that to be the reason.
 - If there were biologists among the extremophiles organisms that live in extreme conditions, they would surely classify themselves as normal and any life that thrived in room temperature as an extremophile.
 - It’s short-sighted to think ads won’t one day end up wherever humans are – even the moon.
 - In any city with lots of skyscrapers, lots of skyline, the moon seems bigger than it is. It’s called the moon illusion.
 - Unlike what you may be told in other sectors of life, when observing the universe, size does matter, which often leads to polite ‘telescope envy’ at gatherings of amateur astronomers.
 - When everyone agrees to a single solution and a single plan, there’s nothing more efficient in the world than an efficient democracy.
 - Access to science is greater than ever before. There are more vehicles out there that grant the public access to science. Not to mention the Internet.
 - We’re talking about a being whose very existence challenges our own sense of priority in the universe.
 - When I reach to the edge of the universe, I do so knowing that along some paths of cosmic discovery, there are times when, at least for now, one must be content to love the questions themselves.
 - There is no true understanding of Biology without Chemistry. And there’s no true understanding of Chemistry without Physics.
 - Space enthusiasts are the most susceptible demographic to delusion that I have ever seen.
 - You have the illusion of free will, but, in fact, that illusion comes about because you don’t know the future. Because you are a prisoner of the present, forever locked in transition, between the past and the future.
 - Where ignorance lurks, so too do the frontiers of discovery and imagination.
 - To achieve this density of a neutron star at home, just cram a herd of 50 million elephants into the volume of a thimble.

 - Perhaps we’ve never been visited by aliens because they have looked upon Earth and decided there’s no sign of intelligent life.
 - Science literacy is the artery through which the solutions of tomorrow’s problems flow.
 - No one is dumb who is curious. The people who don’t ask questions remain clueless throughout their lives.
 - Science is not a subject you took in school. It’s life. We are wrapped by it, in it, with it.
 - The theory of evolution, like the theory of gravity, is a scientific fact.
 - I try to show the public that chemistry, biology, physics, astrophysics is life. It is not some separate subject that you have to be pulled into a corner to be taught about.
 - If cosmological theory were dominated by women, who are no strangers to cycles, how can we know for sure that we wouldn’t then be told that the oscillating universe is the more aesthetically fulfilling alternative?
 - The Big Bang Theory: When geeky scientists can be main characters in a hit prime time series, you know there’s hope for the world.
 - Whether or not you can become great at something, you can always become better.
 - Kids should be allowed to break stuff more often. That’s a consequence of exploration. Exploration is what you do when you don’t know what you’re doing.
 - If there’s something that someone else can do, let them do it. If I couldn’t do it uniquely, let someone else do it and I would get back to the lab.
 - WhenIWasYourAge: People were never “living with their disease.” We cured them. Or they died from it.

 - Just to settle it once and for all: Which came first, the chicken or the egg? The egg, laid by a bird that was not a chicken.
 - We went to the moon and discovered earth.
 - Even with all our technology and the inventions that make modern life so much easier than it once was, it takes just one big natural disaster to wipe all that away and remind us that, here on Earth, we’re still at the mercy of nature.
 - So what is true for life itself is no less true for the universe: knowing where you came from is no less important than knowing where you are going.
 - Dreams about the future are always filled with gadgets.
 - Everything we do, every thought we’ve ever had, is produced by the human brain. But exactly how it operates remains one of the biggest unsolved mysteries, and it seems the more we probe its secrets, the more surprises we find.
 - If the Sun exploded, we wouldn’t know about it for 8 minutes and 20 seconds. Light and gravity take that long to reach us. Then we would vaporize.
 - In the end, it’s the people who are curious who change the world.
 - God is an ever receding pocket of? scientific ignorance.
 - I know of no time in human history where ignorance was better than knowledge.
 - We need more science in the world. Train me.
 - Private enterprise can never lead a space frontier. It’s not possible because a space frontier is expensive, it has unknown risks and it has unquantified risks.

 - Many people feel small because they’re small and the universe is big, but I feel big.
 - Imagination alone is not enough, because the reality of nature is far more wondrous than anything we can imagine.

 - I would request that my body in death be buried not cremated, so that the energy content contained within it gets returned to the earth, so that flora and fauna can dine upon it, just as I have dined upon flora and fauna during my lifetime.
 - All the traditional STEM fields, the science, technology, engineering, and math fields, are stoked when you dream big in an agency such as NASA.
 - Italy valued cathedrals while Spain valued explorers. So worldwide, five times as many people speak Spanish than Italian.
 - If it’s a new planet, sign me up. I’m tired of driving around the block, boldly going where hundreds have gone before in orbit around earth-give me a place to go and I’ll go.
 - Imagine a world in which we are all enlightened by objective truths rather than offended by them.
 - So not enough people in this world, I think, carry a cosmic perspective with them. It could be life-changing.
 - I don’t want people to say, ‘Something is true because Tyson says it is true.’ That’s not critical thinking.
 - Whether or not you can never become great at something, you can always become better at it. Don’t ever forget that! And don’t say “I’ll never be good”. You can become better! and one day you’ll wake up and you’ll find out how good you actually became.
 - Some air you inhale was exhaled by Cleopatra.
 - 85 percent of the gravity of the universe has a point of origin about which we know nothing.
 - Santa knows Physics: Of all colors, Red Light penetrates fog best. That’s why Benny the Blue-nosed reindeer never got the gig.
 - Wanna lose 1200 Calories a month? Drink a liter of ice water a day. You burn the energy just raising the water to body temp.
 - If aliens did visit us, I’d be embarrassed to tell them we still dig fossil fuels from the ground as a source of energy.
 - Today, scientists sound the alarm on other environmental dangers. Vested interests still hire their own scientists to confuse the issue. But in the end, nature, will not be fooled.
 - And extracting one molecule’s signature in spectral analysis from the rest of the signatures is hard work, sort of like picking out the sound of your toddler’s voice in a roomful of screaming children during playtime. It’s hard, but you can do it.
 - Part of knowing how to think is knowing how the laws of nature shape the world around us. Without that knowledge, without that capacity to think, you can easily become a victim of people who seek to take advantage of you.
 - UV is bad for molecules because its high energy breaks the bonds between a molecule’s constituent atoms. That’s why UV is bad for you, too: it’s always best to avoid things that decompose the molecules of your flesh.
 - The more of us that feel the universe, the better off we will be in this world.
 - I’m not criticizing the science in Star Wars. That’s a waste of everybody’s time.
 - To believe in a universe as young as 6- or 7,000 years old, is to extinguish the light of most of the galaxy.
 - In modern times, if the sole measure of what’s out there flows from your five senses then a precarious life awaits you.
 - Countless women are alive today because of ideas stimulated by a design flaw in the Hubble Space Telescope.
 - The very nature of science is discoveries, and the best of those discoveries are the ones you don’t expect.
 - Mars once was wet and fertile. It’s now bone dry. Something bad happened on Mars. I want to know what happened on Mars so that we may prevent it from happening here on Earth.
 - Kids are born curious about the world. What adults primarily do in the presence of kids is unwittingly thwart the curiosity of children.
 - Curiously, light-loving green plants reject the Sun’s green light, reflecting it back at you, which is why they look green.
 - Science is a cooperative enterprise spanning the generations. It’s the passing of a torch from teacher to student to teacher. A community of minds, reaching back to antiquity and forward to the stars.
 - When Kennedy said, ‘Let’s go to the moon,’ we didn’t yet have a vehicle that wouldn’t kill you on launch. He said we’ll land a man on the moon in eight years and bring him back. That was an audacious goal to put forth in front of the American people.
 - I knew my interest in the universe and I owned a telescope that I bought with money I earned by walking dogs. 50 cents per walk, per dog, and that accumulated quickly. I bought a camera, a telescope. I taught myself astrophotography. I did all this.
 - If each dead person became a ghost, there’d be more than 100 billion of them haunting us all. Creepy, but cool.
 - The chances that your tombstone will read ‘Killed by Asteroid’ are about the same as they’d be for ‘Killed in Airplane Crash.’
 - As a scientist, I want to go to Mars and back to asteroids and the Moon because I’m a scientist. But I can tell you, I’m not so naive a scientist to think that the nation might not have geopolitical reasons for going into space.
 - We live in the kind of society where, in almost all cases, hard work is rewarded.
 - I didn’t even know there were stars to look at to not see. If you don’t know that they’re there, you don’t know that you’re missing them.
 - It is astonishing to realize that until Galileo performed his experiments on the acceleration of gravity in the early seventeenth century, nobody questioned Aristotle’s falling balls. Nobody said, Show Me!
 - After 50 years of television, there’s no other conclusion the aliens could draw, but that most humans are neurotic, death-hungry, dysfunctional idiots.
 - With no gravitational force to work against, your body not only doesn’t need the same amount of muscle and bone, it starts breaking them down. As on Earth, so in space: use it or lose it. And exercise may not solve the problem.
 - God displayed a sense of humor when he configured the region between our legs an entertainment complex built around a sewage system.
 - I am proud to be part of a species where a subset of its members willingly put their lives at risk to push the boundaries of our existence.

 - Only when creative people take ownership of cosmic discovery will society accept science as the cultural activity that it is.
 - Science is basically an inoculation against charlatans.
 - Emotional truths woven by lawyers in the court of law are apparently more important than the truths of actual events. I have grown to fear for those whose innocence became trapped within the legal system.
 - We are not simply in the universe, we are part of it. We are born from it. One might even say we have been empowered by the universe to figure itself out – and we have only just begun.
 - A conspiracy theorist is a person who tacitly admits that they have insufficient data to prove their points. A conspiracy is a battle cry of a person with insufficient data.
 - Your center of mass is a place you cannot visit but you always carry with you. Like memories, it is part of life’s baggage.
 - When scientifically investigating the natural world, the only thing worse than a blind believer is a seeing denier.
 - Exploration is what you do when you don’t know what you’re doing. That’s what scientists do every day. If a scientist already knew what they were doing, they wouldn’t be discovering anything, because they already knew what they were doing.
 - If Neptune were analogized with a Chevy Impala in mass, then how big is pluto compared to that? Pluto would be a matchbox car sitting on the curb.
 - If Pizza sizes were given in area not diameter, you’d see instantly that a 7 inch is less than half the size of a 10 inch pie.
 - If you need to invoke your academic pedigree or job title for people to believe what you say, then you need a better argument.
 - If you’re a scientist, and you have to have an answer, even in the absence of data, you’re not going to be a good scientist.
 - Today secular philosophers call that kind of divine invocation God of the gaps-which comes in handy, because there has never been a shortage of gaps in people’s knowledge.
 - The supermoon is a 16-inch pizza compared with a 15-inch pizza. It’s a slightly bigger moon; I ain’t using the adjective ‘supermoon.’
 - The last person I ever want working for me is someone who says ’that’s not in my job description.

 - For centuries, magicians have intuitively taken advantage of the inner workings of our brains.
 - I want and need the artist to take me to new places, and the new place that Van Gogh took me not the sky as it is but the sky as he felt it. And the more of us that feel the universe, the better off we will be in this world.
 - Why can’t Pluto be a planet? Some people like Pluto. And if it doesn’t exist then they don’t have a favorite planet. Right? Please write back but not in cursive because I can’t read cursive.
 - The worst thing that ever happened to America was the 19th Amendment.

 - I’m a fan of the planets in any combination. When I was born, Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, the Sun, and the Moon were all in the sky.
 - Rational thoughts never drive people’s creativity the way emotions do.
 - The day that you stop looking – because you’re content God did it – I don’t need you in the lab. You’re useless on the frontier of understanding the nature of the world.
 - Doing what has never been done before is intellectually seductive, whether or not we deem it practical.
 - The people talking on their cell phone and following GPS instructions to where grandma’s house is saying I don’t need space – excuse me, that’s how you know where grandma lives, and when to make the left turn.
 - Everyone has all different experiences in school. I just know that throughout my life, at no time did any teacher ever point to me and say, hey. He’ll go far.
 - Any astrophysicist does not feel small looking up at the universe; we feel large.
 - The tenacity of life is mind-boggling. We keep finding it where no one thought it could be.
 - I can tell you about the universe, but she feels it; and when you feel the universe, it has a whole other meaning to you. Otherwise, you just put a Wiki page on camera. You can learn something, but it won’t mean anything to you later on.
 - Space is the ultimate frontier. I think when people historically thought of the frontier, there was where you were living and then there was some edge beyond which no one had explored.
 - I lose sleep at night wondering whether we are intelligent enough to figure out the universe. I don’t know.
 - You don’t want to raise a kid in a culture where the kid who asks the most questions is annoying. You want a culture where the kid who asks the most questions gets awards and gets another piece of cake.

 - I remain unconvinced that anything other than rapid decomposition is the fate of my body and mind after death.
 - Next time you’re stunned by a large moon on the horizon, bend over and view it between your legs. The effect goes away entirely.
 - Miniaturization of electronics started by NASA’s push became an entire consumer products industry. Now we’re carrying the complete works of Beethoven on a lapel pin listening to it in headphones.
 - As a child, I was aware that, at night, infrared vision would reveal monsters hiding in the bedroom closet only if they were warm-blooded. But everybody knows that your average bedroom monster is reptilian and cold-blooded.
 - Scientists are human. We have our blind spots and prejudices. Science is a mechanism designed to ferret them out. Problem is we aren’t always faithful to the core values of science.
 - Humans aren’t as good as we should be in our capacity to empathize with feelings and thoughts of others, be they humans or other animals on Earth.
 - The universe is almost 14 billion years old, and, wow! Life had no problem starting here on Earth! I think it would be inexcusably egocentric of us to suggest that we’re alone in the universe.
 - I never volunteer to talk about god or religion, but people feel compelled to talk about it.
 - If you get asteroids about a kilometer in size, those are large enough and carry enough energy into our system to disrupt transportation, communication, the food chains, and that can be a really bad day on Earth.
 - The persistent failures of controlled, double-blind experiments to support the claims of parapsychology suggest that what’s going on is nonsense rather than sixth sense.
 - There are street artists. Street musicians. Street actors. But there are no street physicists. A little known secret is that a physicist is one of the most employable people in the marketplace – a physicist is a trained problem solver.
 - The universe is hilarious! Like, Venus is 900 degrees. I could tell you it melts lead. But that’s not as fun as saying, ‘You can cook a pizza on the windowsill in nine seconds.’ And next time my fans eat pizza, they’re thinking of Venus!
 - I think on some level, role models are overrated If you require a role model who looks just like you to be something you wanna be and you can’t find one, is that a reason to not be what you wanna be? No!
 - You don’t take a dead cat to the vet. I mean you might, but why?
 - Evidence my 14yr old daughter is geek-literate: In lieu of OK, one might type K while texting. She instead typed “Potassium”.

 - I can’t think that leaving Earth once is enough.
 - As important as the civil rights movement was, I think what will rise to the top is that we left Earth in that time.
 - Gamma rays are the sort of radiation you should avoid. Want proof? Just remember how the comic strip character “The Hulk” became big, green, and ugly.
 - We didn’t go to the moon to explore or because it was in our DNA or because we’re Americans. We went because we were at war and we felt a threat.
 - Would a NASA reality show “Lunar Shore” be more popular than “Jersey Shore?” Civilization’s future depends on that answer.
 - The urge to miniaturize electronics did not exist before the space program. I mean our grandparents had radios that was furniture in the living room. Nobody at the time was saying, ‘Gee, I want to carry that in my pocket.’ Which is a non-thought.
 - The Venus transit is not a spectacle the way a total solar eclipse is a spectacle.
 - Some of the greatest poetry is revealing to the reader the beauty in something that was so simple you had taken it for granted.
