 - A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.

 - To not believe in God is to know that it falls to us to make the world a better place.
 - Either God can do nothing to stop catastrophes like this, or he doesn’t care to, or he doesn’t exist. God is either impotent, evil, or imaginary. Take your pick, and choose wisely.
 - It is important to realize that our inability to answer a question says nothing about whether the question itself has an answer.
 - The habit of spending nearly every waking moment lost in thought leaves us at the mercy of whatever our thoughts happen to be. Meditation is a way of breaking this spell.
 - You don’t get anything worth getting, by pretending to know things you don’t know.
 - Atheism is just a way of clearing the space for better conversations.
 - Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply a refusal to deny the obvious. Unfortunately, we live in a world in which the obvious is overlooked as a matter of principle.
 - The core of science is not a mathematical modeling – it is intellectual honesty. It is a willingness to have our certainties about the world constrained by good evidence and good argument.
 - We are all prisoners of our thoughts.
 - If someone doesn’t value evidence, what evidence are you going to provide that proves they should value evidence. If someone doesn’t value logic, what logical argument would you invoke to prove they should value logic?
 - Theology is ignorance with wings.
 - It is time we admitted that we are not at war with terrorism. We are at war with Islam.
 - I know of no society in human history that ever suffered because its people became too desirous of evidence in support of their core beliefs.

 - People who harbor strong convictions without evidence belong at the margins of our societies, not in our halls of power.
 - The problem is that religion tends to give people bad reasons to be good.
 - You can do what you decide to do – but you cannot decide what you will decide to do.
 - We have a choice. We have two options as human beings. We have a choice between conversation and war. That’s it. Conversation and violence. And faith is a conversation stopper.
 - Morality and values depend on the existence of conscious minds – and specifically on the fact that such minds can experience various forms of well-being and suffering in this universe.
 - Our world is fast succumbing to the activities of men and women who would stake the future of our species on beliefs that should not survive an elementary school education.
 - The difference between science and religion is the difference between a willingness to dispassionately consider new evidence and new arguments, and a passionate unwillingness to do so.
 - This is the true horror of religion. It allows perfectly decent and sane people to believe by the billions, what only lunatics could believe on their own.
 - Islam, at the moment, is the motherlode of bad ideas.
 - The principal tenet of Jainism is non-harming. Observant Jains will literally not harm a fly. Fundamentalist Jainism and fundamentalist Islam do not have the same consequences, neither logically nor behaviorally.
 - If premarital sex is a sin, who is the victim?
 - Science is the most durable and nondivisive way of thinking about the human circumstance. It transcends cultural, national, and political boundaries. You don’t have American science versus Canadian science versus Japanese science.

 - The atheist, by merely being in touch with reality, appears shamefully out of touch with the fantasy life of his neighbors.

 - Religious moderation is the product of secular knowledge and scriptural ignorance.
 - Faith enables many of us to endure life’s difficulties with an equanimity that would be scarcely conceivable in a world lit only by reason.
 - The freedom to think out loud on certain topics, without fear of being hounded into hiding or killed, has already been lost.
 - Lying is, almost by definition, a refusal to cooperate with others. It condenses a lack of trust and trustworthiness into a single act. It is both a failure of understanding and an unwillingness to be understood. To lie is to recoil from relationship.
 - Reason is nothing less than the guardian of love.
 - The moral landscape is the framework I use for thinking about questions of morality and human values in universal terms.
 - Jesus Christ – who, as it turns out, was born of a virgin, cheated death, and rose bodily into the heavens – can now be eaten in the form of a cracker.
 - The president of the United States has claimed, on more than one occasion, to be in dialogue with God. If he said that he was talking to God through his hairdryer, this would precipitate a national emergency. I fail to see how the addition of a hairdryer makes the claim more ridiculous or offensive.
 - All civilized nations must unite in condemnation of a theology that now threatens to destabilize much of the earth.
 - You almost never get the pleasure of seeing that you won the argument in real time. People just don’t like to publicly change their minds. They change their minds in private.
 - The second commandment is “Thou shall not construct any graven images.” Is this really the pinnacle of what we can achieve morally? The second most important moral principle for all the generations of humanity?
 - It is merely an accident of history that it is considered normal in our society to believe that the Creator of the universe can hear your thoughts while it is demonstrative of mental illness to believe that he is communicating with you by having the rain tap in Morse code on your bedroom window.
 - What would our world be like if we ceased to worry about ‘right’ and ‘wrong,’ or ‘good’ and ‘evil,’ and simply acted so as to maximize well-being, our own and that of others? Would we lose anything important?
 - Science, in the broadest sense, includes all reasonable claims to knowledge about ourselves and the world.
 - Just as there is no such thing as Christian physics or Muslim Algebra, we will see tht there is no such thing as Christian or Muslim morality.

 - Man is manifestly not the measure of all things. This universe is shot through with mystery. The very fact of its being, and of our own, is a mystery absolute, and the only miracle worthy of the name.
 - Compatibilism amounts to nothing more than an assertion of the following creed: A puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.
 - The science of morality is about maximizing psychological and social health. It’s really no more inflammatory than that.

 - Martin Luther and John Calvin advocated the wholesale murder of heretics, apostates, Jews, and witches.
 - It’s not so much religion per se, it’s false certainty that worries me, and religion just has more than its fair share of false certainty or dogmatism. I’m really concerned when I see people pretending to know things they clearly cannot know.
 - The most transformative experiences people have – bliss, devotion, self transcendence – are currently anchored to the worst parts of culture and to ways of thinking that merely amplify superstition, self-deception, and conflict.
 - My concern with religion is that it allows us by the millions to believe what only lunatics or idiots could believe on their own. That’s not to say that all religious people are lunatics or idiots. It’s anything but that.
 - The only thing that permits human beings to collaborate with one another in a truly open-ended way is their willingness to have their beliefs modified by new facts. Only openness to evidence and argument will secure a common world for us.
 - It is utterly astonishing how ordinary a book can be and still be thought the product of omniscience.
 - Of course, the liar often imagines that he does no harm as long as his lies go undetected.
 - Theology is now little more than a branch of human ignorance.
 - It is time we recognized that belief is not a private matter; it has never been merely private. In fact, beliefs are scarcely more private than actions are, for every belief is a fount of action in potential.
 - We will see that the greatest problem confronting civilization is not merely religious extremism: rather, it is the larger set of cultural and intellectual accommodations we have made to faith itself.
 - A true spiritual practitioner is someone who has discovered that it is possible to be at ease in the world for no reason, if only for a few moments at a time, and that such ease is synonymous with transcending the apparent boundaries of the self.
