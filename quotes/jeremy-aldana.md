 - I am intrigued by the smile upon your face, and the sadness within your eyes.
 - If my eyes have pain, I close them; If my body aches, I rest it; If my heart breaks, I mend it; If my soul is lost, I pray for it.
 - A manâ€™s spirit is free, but his pride binds him with chains of suffocation in a prison of his own insecurities.
 - Each time a man looks into your eyes, he is only searching to find himself; for he knows already, that he is part of you.
