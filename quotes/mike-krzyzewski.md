 - The truth is that many people set rules to keep from making decisions. Not me. I don’t want to be a manager or a dictator. I want to be a leader-and leadership is ongoing, adjustable, flexible, and dynamic. As such, leaders have to maintain a certain amount of discretion.
 - Always get back to your core principles.
 - In leadership, there are no words more important than trust. In any organization, trust must be developed among every member of the team if success is going to be achieved.
 - In order to be a winner, you have to look for ways of getting things done and not for reasons why things can’t be done. People who live with excuses have things that can’t be done hovering around them all the time.

 - It takes courage not only to make decisions, but to live with those decisions afterward.
 - When you first assemble a group, it’s not a team right off the bat. It’s only a collection of individuals.
 - I have a rule on my team: When we talk to one another, we look each other right in the eye, because I think it’s tough to lie to somebody. You give respect to somebody.
 - You don’t just be a team. You become a team. Through tough games you find that you need each other.
 - Leaders have to search for the heart on a team, because the person who has it can bring out the best in everybody else.
 - You can’t defer if you’re the person who’s in the leadership position.
 - Effort is fully replenishable. There is no need to save any of it. Leave every bit you have on the playing field.
 - There are five fundamental qualities that make every team great: communication, trust, collective responsibility, caring and pride. I like to think of each as a separate finger on the fist. Any one individually is important. But all of them together are unbeatable.
 - When you are passionate, you always have your destination in sight and you are not distracted by obstacles. Because you love what you are pursuing, things like rejection and setbacks will not hinder you in your pursuit. You believe that nothing can stop you!
 - I have a plan of action, but the game is a game of adjustments.

 - Play and practice like you are trying to make the team.

 - Leaders show respect for people by giving them time.
 - Imagination has a great deal to do with winning.
 - Every season is a journey. Every journey is a lifetime.
 - Growth creates complexity, which requires simplicity.
 - For a college basketball player or coach, to reach the Final Four is la-la land. You’ve achieved, you’ve got your stamp of approval. My first team to do that was in 1986. Then we did it in ’88, ’89 and ’90.
 - The person who has inspired me my whole life is my Mom, because she taught me commitment. She sacrificed.
 - In developing teams, I don’t believe in rules. I believe in standards. Rules don’t promote teamwork, standards do.
 - You develop a team to achieve what one person cannot accomplish alone. All of us alone are weaker, by far, than if all of us are together.
 - In our program, the truth is the basis of all we do. There is nothing more important than the truth because there’s nothing more powerful than the truth. Consequently, on our team, we always tell each other the truth. We must be honest with one another. There is no other way.
 - Friendships, along with love, make life worth living.
 - I never want to lead a team that is not allowed the freedom to pursue what’s in their hearts. If you want your team to be fully committed, then you’d better be fully committed.
 - That’s why basketball was so good, because I didn’t really need you or anyone else to play it. It would be better if we played four-on-four or five-on-five, but I could go out there alone.
 - During critical periods, a leader is not allowed to feel sorry for himself, to be down, to be angry, or to be weak. Leaders must beat back these emotions.
 - I think coaching is confused at times as being an arrow that only goes to a player. Those players send arrows back to you, and that’s where a relationship is developed. I don’t make a player, and a player doesn’t make me a coach. We make each other.
 - I had a really bad temper, when I was growing up. Sport helped me channel that temper into more positive acts.
 - Never delegate. Always empower.
 - Almost everything in leadership comes back to relationships.
 - In putting together your standards, remember that it is essential to involve your entire team. Standards are not rules issued by the boss; they are a collective identity. Remember, standards are the things that you do all the time and the things for which you hold one another accountable.

 - I think you’re not a human being unless you have doubts and fears.
 - Never let a person’s weakness get in the way of their strength.
 - I think some parents now look at a youngster failing as the final thing. It’s a process, and failure is part of the process. I would like it if the teacher and the parents would connect more. I think that used to be, but we’re losing a little bit of that right now.
 - Defense is one man guarding the ball and four others helping him.
 - Don’t do anything as an individual that will make you stand out from your teammates.
 - I’ve tried to handle winning well, so that maybe we’ll win again, but I’ve also tried to handle failure well. If those serve as good examples for teachers and kids, then I hope that would be a contribution I have made to sport. Not just basketball, but to sport.

 - Making shots counts, but not as much as the people who make them.

 - Believe that the loose ball that you are chasing has your name wirtten on it.
 - Footwork is one of the primary prerequisites to becoming a great player.
