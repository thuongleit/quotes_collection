 - The goal of physiological research is functional nature.
 - Exact information about the functional significance of the deep sections of the brain is only obtained by working through the brain histologically in serial section.
 - In fact, quantitative findings of any material and energy changes preserve their full context only through their being seen and understood as parts of a natural order.
 - At the beginning of all experimental work stands the choice of the appropriate technique of investigation.
 - It must be born in mind that one does not see directly – as is the case in the exploration of the surface of the brain – where the electrodes are attacking.
 - For man also, in health and sickness, is not just the sum of his organs, but is indeed a human organism.
