 - Islam is a religion in which God requires you to send your son to die for him. Christianity is a faith in which God sends his son to die for you.
 - In a free society, government reflects the soul of its people. If people want change at the top, they will have to live in different ways. Our major social problems are not the cause of our decadence. They are a reflection of it.
 - No nation can survive without passing its heritage, language and, yes, faith to the next generation. A country must be built on something substantial and if the cultural elitists think it can be built on ‘diversity,’ that is a foundation of shifting sand.
 - Evil cannot be accommodated. It must be defeated.
 - I am not robbed by people who have more money than me. I am robbed by a government that wants to penalize my industry and give increasing portions of what I earn to people who do not emulate my principles, morals and ethics.

 - It is easier to drive a stake through the heart of a blood-sucking vampire than to kill off a money-sucking and useless government program.
 - I sense a general hostility toward Christianity among the literary and media establishments in our country. There is a tendency to keep Christian thinking out of the mainstream, to marginalize it and make it look like a product of ‘fringe’ groups.
 - People, like water, will run downhill, seeking their lowest level unless something interdicts them.
 - We tolerate, even promote, many things we once regarded as evil, wrong, or immoral. And then we seek “explanations” for an act that seems beyond comprehension. Remove societal restraints on some evils and one can expect the demons to be freed to conduct other evil acts.
 - No child is taught to kill, but he has to be taught to love, respect, honor and value, not only his own life, but the lives of his classmates, parents and teachers. He has to experience love and acceptance. He has to know his life has purpose and meaning. No amount of money can do that.

 - Government aid impedes success and creates dependence, while entrepreneurs create success and independence.
 - It is now possible to live a “christian life” without doing the things that Jesus commanded us to do. We have hired people to go into all the world, to visit those in prison, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to care for widows and orphans. The average Christian doesn’t have to do it.
 - In violent streets and broken homes, the cry of anguished souls is not for more laws but for more conscience and character.
 - Victimhood and a ‘can’t do’ spirit is what the Democratic Party has mostly been about since the Great Depression.
 - If life is not a continuum, from conception to natural death, then all of us are potential victims if we fall out of favor with a ruling elite.

 - Another question a biblically literate reporter might have asked is, “Why are you proclaiming the Ten Commandments when you believe no one can live up to all of them?”
 - Homo-sexuals should not be censored, but neither should those who oppose their point of view. That’s called free speech.
 - No power on earth is greater than a mind and soul reawakened. Our Constitution begins we the people, not us the government.
 - It’s time to resist efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union who have conducted a religious lobotomy on this country, seeking to strip it of any vestige of religious influence.
 - Our politics suffers from a shortage of people who put character and country before career and personal gain.
 - If a state, or nation, has laws it will not enforce for political reasons, it mocks both the law and politics, to say nothing of the cultural order.
 - Asking politicians to give up a source of money is like asking Dracula to forsake blood.
 - Radical Islamists are serious about killing in pursuit of their extreme objectives. Releasing their soldiers can only embolden them to take more Americans hostage. The deal for Sgt. Bergdahl may well turn out to have been a bargain with the devil.

 - We are approaching a time when Christians, especially, may have to declare the social contract between Enlightenment rationalists and Biblical believers – which formed the basis of the constitution written at our nation’s founding – null and void.
 - The Obama ‘stimulus’ plan is a $1 trillion dollar gamble more suited to Las Vegas than Washington.
 - President Obama is like a lost man who refuses to ask for directions. That’s because he has never worked in the real world with people who create real jobs. He operates on theories and an ideology that is incapable of achieving his goals.
 - If taxpayers want to keep more of the money they earn, they must also work to become less dependent on a government check. We look to government too often and to ourselves not enough.
 - The difference between the more traditional sports clubs and Congress is that Congress doesn’t really compete against another team.
 - So, my fellow Christians, protest this film if you like, but then how about devoting some energy to fill the vacuum created by your retreat from popular culture.
