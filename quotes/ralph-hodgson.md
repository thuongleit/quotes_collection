 - Some things have to be believed to be seen.
 - Without a wish, without a will, I stood upon that silent hill And stared into the sky until My eyes were blind with stars and still I stared into the sky.
 - Time, you old gipsy man, Will you not stay, Put up your caravan Just for one day?
 - I saw with open eyes, Singing birds sweet, Sold in the shops, For the people to eat, Sold in the shops of, Stupidity Street.
 - God loves an idle rainbow, no less than laboring seas.
 - Did anyone ever have a boring dream?
 - The handwriting on the wall may be a forgery.
