 - Lord, help us to live the virtue of generosity, to love without limits.

 - Miracles happen. But prayer is needed! Prayer that is courageous, struggling and persevering, not prayer that is a mere formality.
 - Sin, also for those who don’t have faith, exists when one goes against one’s conscience. To listen to and obey it means, in fact, to decide in face of what is perceived as good or evil. And on this decision pivots the goodness or malice of our action.
 - The joy of the Gospel is for all people: no one can be excluded.
 - We can walk when we want to, we can build many things, but if we do not witness to Jesus Christ then it doesn’t matter. We might become a philanthropic NGO but we wouldn’t be the Church, the Bride of the Lord.

 - Our Christian identity is belonging to a people: the Church. Without the Church we are not Christians.
 - I am always wary of decisions made hastily. I am always wary of the first decision, that is, the first thing that comes to my mind if I have to make a decision. This is usually the wrong thing. I have to wait and assess, looking deep into myself, taking the necessary time.
 - We need courage if we are to be faithful to the Gospel.
 - Dear parents, have great patience, and forgive from the depths of your heart.

 - May the World Day of Consecrated Life be a timely occasion to rediscover the centrality of Jesus in our lives.
 - Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.
 - Because if we destroy Creation, Creation will destroy us! Never forget this!

 - Open your hearts to the Lord. The Lord is waiting for you and the Church will welcome you if your willingness to serve good is as clear and public as your choice to serve evil was.

 - I make a forceful and urgent call to the entire Catholic Church, and also to every Christian of other confessions, as well as to followers of every religion and to those brothers and sisters who do not believe: peace is a good which overcomes every barrier, because it belongs to all of humanity!
 - We cannot be tepid disciples. The Church needs our courage in order to give witness to truth.
 - Being a Christian means renouncing ourselves, taking up the cross and carrying it with Jesus. There is no other way.
