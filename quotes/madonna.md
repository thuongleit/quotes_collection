 - I think you can be defiant and rebellious and still be strong and positive.

 - With all the chaos, pain and suffering in the world, the fact that my adoption of a child from who was living in an orphanage, you know, was the number one story for a week in the world. To me, that says more about our inability to focus on the real problems.
 - I don’t care anymore if people dress like me, now I want them to think like me.
 - It’s not easy having a good marriage – but I don’t want easy. Easy doesn’t make you grow. Easy doesn’t make you think. I thank God everyday that I am married to a man who makes me think. That’s my definition of true love.
 - I like film soundtracks. I like the soundtracks better than the movies.
 - Motherhood was the beginning of my own journey asking the question, ‘Why am I here?’ I had to stop and think: What am I doing to teach my daughter? What do I believe in?

 - Bad girl, drunk by six, kissing someone else’s lips. Smoked to many cigarettes today, I’m not happy when I act this way.
 - If those civil rights groups are going into those orphanages and offering to look after those children, then they have every right to make a stink about it. But they’re not. They’re not offering a solution.

 - In our house we don’t use words like “despise” and ‘hate,’ we say “strongly dislike.”
 - When you make a movie, it’s just a huge bureaucracy because movies cost so much money. Millions of people get involved, and pretty soon the creative idea gets tramped on and watered down or filtered through a huge system.
 - I just like the idea of pills. I like to collect them but not actually take them. When I fell off my horse, I got tons of stuff: Demerol and Vicodin and Xanax and Valium and Oxycontin, which is supposed to be like heroin. And I’m quite scared to take them. I’m a control freak.
 - I think lines are meant to be crossed anyways. The entire time I was singing on the cross, there’s numbers flipping over my head. You know, starting at one and going up to 12 million.

 - Rejection is the greatest aphrodisiac.
 - In some respects I will never die. Because art is immortal. What we leave behind and what we create – the energy that we put out into the world is eternal.
 - My life is not a game that I play to entertain you.
 - One must dare to show what he wants. You have to go and ask for things rather than wait for them to happen.
 - To me, the most important thing – aside from meeting people’s physical needs, whether that’s education, health care, clothing, food, a roof over their heads – is changing the mind-set and educating people. And most of all, most important, is empowering people and making them self-sustaining.
 - Effeminate men intrigue me more than anything in the world. I see them as my alter egos. I feel very drawn to them. I think like a guy, but I’m feminine. So I relate to feminine men.
 - Thanks for all the birthday love! I feel like the luckiest girl in the world today!

 - I could bring you so much pleasure, erotic, erotic, put your hands all over my body.
 - You took a poison arrow and you aimed it at my heart. It’s heavy and it’s bitter, and it’s tearing me apart.
 - When I discovered that I could write music, it felt like the most natural way for me to connect with people and tell my stories. I’ve always thought of that as what I do: I tell stories.
 - The critics have been writing me off for 20 years. That’s nothing new. As far as I know I still have plenty of fans and sell lots of records. Do I care what critics say about me? No, and I don’t read reviews.
 - I think the silence would be good with me, and not interacting with people would be okay. But not being able to move outside of the space would be hard. Not being able to walk around – the stillness of my body, physically – that would be the challenge.
 - I am a tip-top starlet. That is my job that I am paid to do.
 - Economic markets are collapsing. People all over the world are suffering and people afraid. What happens when peep are afraid? They become intolerant.
 - The beast is the modern world that we live in! The material world. The physical world. The world of illusion that we think is real. We live for it; we’re enslaved by it. And it will ultimately be our undoing.
 - If you have to ask for something more than once or twice, it wasn’t yours in the first place. And that’s hard to accept when you love someone.
 - I feel like I’ve survived so much, and been through so much. And sometimes I miss the innocence of those times. Life was different. New York was different. The music business was different. I miss the simplicity of it, the naivete of everyone around me.

 - I think art should be controversial. I think it should make people think.
 - When you make a movie, it seems like there’s nothing but resistance. It’s kind of a miracle that any movie ever gets made.
 - I’m not claiming to appeal to the same people that Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears are going to appeal to. I’m not trying to. I’m doing what I want to do.
 - I don’t give a damn if I go to hell.
 - I’m constantly exploring spirituality, sexuality, different aspects of love, whether it’s romantic love or the love you have for your children. And love can be as devastating and destructive as it can be rejuvenating and life-giving. I guess I try to capture all of that.
 - I feel like everybody needs to take a sabbatical and go to Russia and Africa and work in orphanages and really witness true suffering. And then you’ll just feel ridiculous for ever complaining about anything. Everybody needs that kind of reality check.
 - I was a buffoon and an idiot until the age of forty.
 - Do I have to change my name, will it get me far? Should I lose some weight, am I gonna be a star?
 - I guess some people are brilliant enough to be brilliant on their own and never doubt anything and come up with fabulous things. But I think it’s good to get into arguments with people and have them say, ‘That sucks’ or ‘You’re crazy’ or ‘That’s cheesy’ or ‘What do you think of this?’
 - I do think of myself as a queen, but I don’t think I’m the only queen. There’s room for other queens. We reign over different kingdoms.
 - In America it is not considered to be mentally ill when a woman advances on her prey in a discotheque setting with hardy cocktails present.

 - Family is everything. Family comes first. It’s not what I expected it to be, but nothing ever is.
 - I refuse to act the way someone expects me to.
 - Marriage? I don’t know what I really think about marriage. I’m a bit confused on that issue.
 - Obviously, I feel a great sense of responsibility being a good parent and raising my children. I don’t take that job very lightly. Who they are, what they become and what they contribute to the world is very important to me.
 - When I think about popular culture, I can’t help but think that we’re living in the age of loneliness. There’s this illusion that we all have instant access to each other, but we actually have no real connection.
 - In everyday life I am quiet and reserved, not the housekeeper type but cool and relaxed. I don’t get up in the morning wearing false eyelashes and I don’t wear fancy underwear when I’m cooking popcorn. I’m a nice little ducky.
 - When I first moved to New York I wanted to be a dancer, I danced professionally for years, living a hand-to-mouth existence.
 - Some people out there think everything I do is a publicity stunt, they think when I go to the bathroom it’s a publicity stunt.
 - My heart goes out to the families of innocent children who were killed today in Pakistan!! I do not accept a world where kids are killed for wanting an education! This violence and ignorance has to stop!!!! It starts with all of us treating all human beings with dignity and respect!!
 - I hate polite conversation. I hate it when people stand around and go, ‘Hi, how are you?’ I hate words that don’t have any reason or meaning. Also I hate it when people smoke in elevators and closed in places. It’s just so rude.

 - Hurt that’s not supposed to show, and tears that fall when no one knows.
 - Hanging a noose on my door reeks of cowardice and fear on many, many levels.
 - I came to the realization that a strong female is frightening to everybody, because all societies are male-dominated – black societies, poor people, rich people, any racial group, they’re all dominated by men. A strong female is going to threaten everybody across the board.
 - It’s not my nature to just kick back.
 - We’re very privileged as Americans – it’s easy to forget about the rest of the world and to think that your problems are the most important problems. Even poor people in America live better than poor people most everywhere else.
 - I don’t trust any man who hasn’t kissed another man.
 - I am very proud to be Italian.
 - Rita Haywood gave good face.
 - I loved nuns when I was growing up. I thought they were beautiful. For several years I wanted to be a nun. I saw them as really pure, disciplined, above average people. They had these serene faces. Nuns are sexy.
 - I think that its an artist’s responsibility to have a point of view. Society takes its cue from popular art. People need something to look to, something to provoke them into questioning whether they completely hate something or completely love something.
 - Jean-Baptiste Mondino: “She’s John Lennon and Yoko Ono at the same time”.
 - I keep telling everyone that I want to start a revolution but no one is taking me seriously. If I had black skin and an afro, would you take me seriously? If I was an Arab waving a hand grenade, would you take me seriously?
 - Death was a big part of my life growing up. I went to lots of funerals.
 - The one thing I don’t understand is when people make comments who are clearly not fans of mine. I think, why are you here? Why are you wasting your time? It’s fascinating.
 - I miss New York. I still love how people talk to you on the street – just assault you and tell you what they think of your jacket.
 - Every time I reach a new peak, I see a new one I want to climb.
 - I like to change. A new lamp, a piece of art, can transform a room.
 - I know I’m not the greatest singer or dancer, but that doesn’t interest me, I’m interested in being provocative and pushing people’s buttons.
 - People who listen to them properly don’t underestimate them. Unfortunately, there’s so much about my career and me that distracts people from the actual content of most of my songs.
 - I’ve read a couple of reviews that say I’m getting harder in my old age but I don’t think that’s true at all. I think that you can’t help but become a little cynical about life and love but I’m still a romantic, I’m still an idealist.
 - I hope I will always have the ability to create art and live in a world where I can speak freely, and I can inspire people. I don’t know what form that will take.
 - Romance should be spontaneous, but in my career I’m totally in control.
 - I think they probably got it on, Jesus and Mary Magdalene.
 - One of the many things I learned from all of this: If you aren’t willing to fight for what you believe in, then don’t even enter the ring.

 - If at first you don’t succeed, you’re obviously not me.
 - Fame gets you in the door but it doesn’t keep you in the room.

 - What else is there for me to conquer? Hopefully my ego.
 - My idea of the perfect man would be someone intelligent and clever enough, but also kind and compassionate enough to stand up to me – to stand up to me with compassion.
 - I’ve always been interested in electronica, techno, trip-hop, that kind of music. The thing that bothered me about a lot of that music, though, was it seemed devoid of emotion. There wasn’t a lot that felt personal.
 - There are moments when I can’t believe I’m as old as I am. But I feel better physically than I did 10 years ago. I don’t think, Oh God, I’m missing something.

 - It doesn’t matter who you are, it’s what you do that takes you far.
 - I tried to be a boy, I tried to be a girl, I tried to be a mess.
 - I like to be a team player. All the projects I do are collaborations. And I want to solicit the opinions and help of other people. I’m not interested in being the one in charge.
 - My son youngest son David’s favorite song – he plays guitar – and he likes “Devil Pray.” That’s his favorite.
 - Catholicism is a really mean religion, and it’s incredibly hypocritical. But it plays a role in my life ’cause you can’t really get a lot of things out of your head, such as what Jesus Christ looks like and that divorce is a horrible thing.
 - I love horses. I think I may have been one of Henry VIII’s knights in another life, riding through a great forest.

 - Being loved keeps you young.

 - I became very obsessed with death, and the idea that you never know when death will arrive, so one has to do as much as possible all the time to get the most out of life. That would be a motivating force.
 - I don’t know what our government does except put us into debt and blow up other countries.
 - My daughter has a problem picking things up in her room. So if you leave your clothes on the floor, we put them in a trash bag. She has to earn them back by being tidy. I’m a disciplinarian. Guy’s the spoiler.
 - With every breath, I’m deeper in you.
 - I want to keep growing and living life to the fullest for as long as I’m on this planet.

 - Isn’t it amazing that there are laws of the universe that you can actually find out about, live your life according to and change the world for the better?
 - I’m not a reluctant pop star. I’m very grateful and happy for everything that I have and for things when they go well. On the other hand, I’ve had enough of the other side to know that if it doesn’t, I will survive that and life goes on.
