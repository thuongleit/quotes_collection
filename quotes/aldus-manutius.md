 - Those who cultivate letters must be supplied with the books necessary for their purpose; and until this supply is secured I shall not rest.
 - It is disgraceful to live as a stranger in oneâ€™s country, and be an alien in any matter that affects our welfare.
 - Talk of nothing but business, and dispatch that business quickly.
