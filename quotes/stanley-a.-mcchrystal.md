 - Leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure.
 - I came to believe that a leader isn’t good because they’re right; they’re good because they’re willing to learn and to trust.
 - I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful; they didn’t lie, cheat, steal or abandon their comrades.
