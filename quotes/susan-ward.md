 - Be helpful – even if there’s no immediate profit in it.
 - Deal with complaints. If you give the complaint your attention, you may be able to please this one person this one time – and position your business to reap the benefits of good customer service.
 - Don’t make promises unless you will keep them. Not plan to keep them. Will keep them. Reliability is one of the keys to any good relationship, and good customer service is no exception.
 - Answer your phone. Get call forwarding. Or an answering service. Hire staff if you need to. But make sure that someone is picking up the phone when someone calls your business.
 - I am not sexually attracted to women. I would rather sleep with an ugly man than with a woman.
 - Listen to your customers. Can the sales pitches and the product babble. Let your customer talk and show him that you are listening by making the appropriate responses, such as suggesting how to solve the problem.
 - The irony of good customer service is that over time it will bring in more new customers than promotions and price slashing ever did!
 - Throw in something extra. Whether it’s a coupon for a future discount, additional information on how to use the product, or a genuine smile, people love to get more than they thought they were getting. And don’t think that a gesture has to be large to be effective.
 - Lower prices are not service; they’re just lower prices.
