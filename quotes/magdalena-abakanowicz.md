 - Art will remain the most astonishing activity of mankind born out of struggle between wisdom and madness, between dream and reality in our mind.
 - Art does not solve problems but makes us aware of their existence. It opens our eyes to see and our brain to imagine.
 - It is easy to follow, but it is uninteresting to do easy things. We find out about ourselves only when we take risks, when we challenge and question.
