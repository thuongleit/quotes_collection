 - Death is not a foe, but an inevitable adventure.
 - A fish probably has no means of apprehending the existence of water; it is too deeply immersed in it.
 - Life must be considered sui generis; it is not a form of energy, nor can it be expressed in terms of something else.
 - Death is the end of a stage, not the end of the journey. The road stretches on beyond our comprehension.
 - Matter moves, but Ether is strained.
 - There is a conservation of matter and of energy, there may be a conservation of life; or if not of life, of something which transcends life.
 - We know that communication must be hampered, and its form largely determined, by the unconscious but inevitable influence of a transmitting mechanism, whether that be of a merely mechanical or of a physiological character.

 - The old series of sittings with Mrs. Piper convinced me of survival for reasons which I should find it hard to formulate in any strict fashion, but that was their distinct effect.

 - The properties which differentiate living matter from any kind of inorganic imitation may be instinctively felt, but can hardly be formulated without expert knowledge.
 - Death is not a word to fear, any more than birth is.
