 - To cheapen the lives of any group of men, cheapens the lives of all men, even our own. This is a law of human psychology, or human nature. And it will not be repealed by our wishes, nor will it be merciful to our blindness.

 - An insignificant right becomes important when it is assailed.
 - The best time to do something is when it can be done.
