 - I’m okay, you’re okay. Now let’s go to work.

 - I am not my sister’s keeper. I am my sister.

 - Trying to prove something to someone is never a valid reason for doing anything.

 - You set the standards for how you will be treated. People will treat you the exact way you treat yourself. So be good to you. Take time for yourself. Rest. Play. Shower yourself with affection, support, and gifts.
 - Always remember who you are. Know that you are never required to apologize to anyone for being yourself.
 - Challenges come so we can grow and be prepared for things we are not equipped to handle now. When we face our challenges with faith, prepared to learn, willing to make changes, and if necessary, to let go, we are demanding our power be turned on.
 - When your way doesn’t work, don’t be disheartened. You must be willing to try another way. A closed door doesn’t mean you have been cut off permanently. It is a challenge, an obstacle, a tool to be used.
 - Don’t get hung up on the hard times, the challenges. Tell your story by highlighting the victories. Because it’s your victories that will inspire, motivate, encourage other people to live their stories in grander ways.

 - You cannot experience the fullness of your authentic self or life when you live to avoid hurt. You will never know the joy of love or the peaceful satisfaction of being loved if you hide from hurt.
 - Education does not take place when you learn something you did not know before. Education is your ability to use what you have learned to be better today than you were yesterday.
 - Have the courage to be exactly who you are without apology. Admit your mistakes without beating yourself up. Release all shame! Release all guilt! You cannot live if you are hiding behind what was. Focus on what is, right now, and that is you!

 - The thing I always tell my audiences all the time is that I’m just two steps ahead of you on a good day. And I might be two steps behind you on a bad day.

 - What looks like a failure teaches us what not to do, what does not work. We have lessons to learn from our experiences.
 - Stuff your feelings because feelings buried alive don’t die. And that fear or that upset or that anger or that whatever it is, it’ll turn into something inside of you. So you want to get it out.

 - The show is ‘Fix My Life!’ Get it? Life. I do not fix people.

 - Life gives you an endless supply of do-overs.
 - When we have peace in our hearts and minds, we draw peace into our lives.

 - If you should encounter angry or unkind actions today, take a deep breath, reach deep within and greet the lack of love with love.
 - All relationships have the same basic components: people, needs, and expectations.
 - You’re never healing the level you’re on. You’re always healing the level you came from. For example, you know things today that you didn’t know in your first marriage.
 - Until you are willing to accept total and complete responsibility for every aspect of your life, your life will keep sending you experiences designed to get your attention.
 - We must learn not to give up when requirements are not met or when commitments are broken. To do so is a refusal to allow mistakes to be corrected and a demonstration of an unwillingness to forgive yourself or anyone else who needs forgiveness.

 - Give yourself permission to smile a lot today. In fact, why not make it a habit!
 - When you gossip, it’s self-hexing. Because when you do it, it comes back to you. Everything starts with the word. The word is demonstrating a condition of the mind. If it’s in your mind and comes out of your mouth, it will be created.
 - We think we have to do something to be grateful or something has to be done in order for us to be grateful, when gratitude is a state of being.

 - When we want to move beyond the pain, when we want to feel better, when we are ready to move beyond where we are, emotionally and spiritually, we must forgive.

 - Life doesn’t actually knock you down. It does, however, provide you with many opportunities to evaluate your standing in life: what you stand on, what you stand for, how you stand within yourself and for yourself.
 - I see a couple of things missing. Any society, any community, even in the family, when the elders don’t do their jobs, the youth suffer. We have no done our job. I’m saying anybody 55 and up. We didn’t teach people the basic things.
 - One way to eliminate self negating thoughts and behavior is by gaining more understanding through realizing that you cannot force others to see that what you feel is real.
 - Remain open. There is something bigger than you know going on here.
 - Forgiveness is not about the other person or what they did. Forgiveness is for YOU and about YOU.
 - Challenges come so we can grow and be prepared for things we are not equipped to handle now.

 - Respect you love one enough to know thay can handle your truth.
 - The only energy that has any power in your life is the gift of breath from God.

 - So many of us invest a fortune making ourselves look good to the world, yet inside we are falling apart. It’s time to invest on the inside.
 - Instead of running from what you don’t want, walk with commitment toward what you desire. Focus on where you are going rather than being obsessed with where you have been.

 - When anyone makes comments that are offensive to you, would you be willing to do the teaching?
 - The key to success is not what you do, it is how you feel about what you are doing.
 - Without the a test you don’t have a testimony.
 - When you believe, or are led to believe, you are unable to act upon the greatest desires of the soul, the result is mental and spiritual enslavement.
 - You can’t just cry about the pain. You can’t just pray about the pain. You must eliminate the pain.

 - You’re demonstrating a courage that most people can’t even fathom: giving it all away in order to have yourself.
 - What would it take for you to forget all your troubles? Are you willing to simply forget all your troubles today? When you remove your attention from a problem, it gets bored and moves away!
