 - I would rather be a servant in the house of the Lord than to sit in the seats of the mighty.
 - For six years profound silence was mistaken for profound wisdom.
 - I shouldnâ€™t toot my own horn, but he who doth not toot his own horn alloweth it to remain untooteth.
 - The best audience is one that is intelligent, well-educated, and a little drunk.
