 - The prince is never going to come. Everyone knows that; and maybe sleeping beauty’s dead.
 - I love you still, that’s the torment of it. Lestat I never loved. But you! The measure of my hatred is that love. They are the same! Do you know now how much I hate you!
 - I can’t help being a gorgeous fiend. It’s just the card I drew.
 - The atheism and nihilism of my earlier years now seems shallow, and even a bit cocky.
 - My conscience is killing me, isn’t it? And when you’re immortal that can be a really long and ignominious death.
 - Everyone is a potential naked slave to you once you become a trainer.
 - We breathe the light, we breathe the music, we breathe the moment as it passes through us.
 - I want to love all the children of God – Christian, Jew, Moslem, Hindu, Buddhist – everyone. I want to love gay Christians and straight Christians.
 - Our language needs endless synonyms for beautiful; the eyes could see what the tongue cannot possibly describe.
 - I feel like an outsider, and I always will feel like one. I’ve always felt that I wasn’t a member of any particular group.

 - The truth is most women are weak, be they mortal or immortal. But when they are strong, they are absolutely unpredictable.
 - Old truths and ancient magic, revolution and invention, all conspire to distract us from the passion that in one way or another defeats us all.
 - The finest thing under the sun and moon is the human soul. I marvel at the small miracles of kindness that pass between humans, I marvel at the growth of conscience, at the persistence of reason in the face of all superstition or despair. I marvel at human endurance.
 - The supernatural world has always been more real to me than the real world.

 - How pathetic it is to describe these things which can’t truly be described.

 - I am in love with you’, I responded. He laughed the most beguiling and gentle laugh. ‘Of course you are,’ he replied. ‘I understand perfectly because I’m in love with myself.

 - In the name of Christ, I quit Christianity.
 - Amazing what the British do with language; the nuances of politeness. The world’s great diplomats, surely.
 - It’s an awful truth that suffering can deepen us, give a greater lustre to our colours, a richer resonance to our words. That is, if it doesn’t destroy us, if it doesn’t burn away the optimism and the spirit, the capacity for visions, and the respect for simple yet indispensable things.
 - You reach deep down and bring up what feels absolutely authentic to you as you move along with the book, but you don’t know everything about it. You can’t.
 - Your quest is for darkness only. This sea is not your sea. The myths of men are not your myths. Men’s treasures are not yours.

 - Oh to have you with me, to have you here, not to be alone, but to be with you, my beauty, you of all souls! You.
 - The human heart is my school.
 - The old gods will bring about vengeance not so much because they exist but because I once honored them.
 - So we reach into the raging chaos, and we cling to it, and we tell ourselves it has meaning, and that the world is good, and we are not evil, and we will all go home in the end.
 - I lived like a man who wanted to die but who had no courage to do it himself.

 - It was as if this night were only one of thousands of nights, world without end, night curving into night to make a great arching line of which I couldn’t see the end, a night in which I roamed alone under cold, mindless stars.
 - Sometimes fear is a warning. It’s like someone putting a hand on your shoulder and saying Go No Farther.
 - What does all this mean finally, I kept asking like a college kid. Why does it make me want to cry? Maybe it’s that we are all outsiders, we are all making our own unusual way through a wilderness of normality that is just a myth.
 - I think to feel this happy is to be miserable, to feel this much satisfaction is to burn.
 - It struck me, sharp and hard, that I had been given so many chances to save my soul that my entire life had been constructed around these chances! That was my nature – going from temptation to temptation, not to sin, but to be redeemed.
 - We are not damned. We never were. Who under the sun has the right to damn any living breathing creature?
 - You are alone when something like this happens. Doesn’t matter how many people love you and want to help you. You are alone. When Marchent died, she was alone.
 - All the mortal world is a lethal enemy during those hours between dawn and dusk.
 - Sleep is your friend. Dreams are your unwelcome guests.
 - When you make his sandwiches, put a sexy or loving note in his lunch box.
 - We need to stop fighting Christian against Christian. I have no time for anything but trying to love other people. That is a full-time job.
 - Maybe that’s what Hell is. You go mad. And all your demons come and get you just as fast as you can think them up.
 - My own funeral, I’d like to be laid out in a coffin in my own house. I would like my coffin to be put in the double parlor, and I would like all the flowers to be white.
 - He had grieved for me, I’ll give him that much. But then he is so good at grieving! He wears woe as others wear velvet; sorrow flatters him like the light of candles; tears become him like jewels.
 - And so this young one, this young one whom I had so loved, I had to forsake, no matter how broken my heart, no matter how lonely my soul, no matter how bruised my intellect and spirit.
 - Lestat: Toughen up baby. I’m looking for the eternal scum.
 - We are predators, Whose all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
 - But death we are, and death we’ve always been.
 - Ah, come now. I look like an angel, but I’m not. The old rules of nature encompass many creatures like me. We’re beautiful like the diamond-backed snake, or the striped tiger, yet we’re merciless killers.
 - I assume as a child Jesus had to learn how to do carpentry, learn Torah, learn all the things a human child had to learn. If He was human in all ways except that He did not sin, this must have been the case.
 - Truth is a risky proposition. It’s the nature of mediocre human beings to believe that lies are necessary, that they serve a purpose, that truth is subversive, that candor is dangerous, that the very scaffold of communal life is supported by lies.
 - It was over now, and the meaningless world was tolerable and need not be explained. And never would it be, and how foolish I had ever been to think so.
 - I can’t believe the world was created in six days. I do not take Genesis or Revelation literally. I AM OUT. I am alone. I am an outsider for Christ. I will study my Bible, and pray to God in private and alone. I have no other choice.
 - Should we put out the light? And then put out the light. But once put out thy light, I cannot give it vital breath again. It needs must wither.
 - I think that we are supernatural. We are unique. We’re the only animals in the universe that we know of that actually have self-consciousness, a sense of time and our own mortality.
 - Dickens is a very underrated writer at the moment. Everyone in his time admired him but I think right now he’s not spoken of enough.
 - People write to me all the time to tell me that “homosexuality is an abomination.” They base this on a quote in Leviticus. I think the Bible has proved to be a very mysterious and dangerous document.
 - Life itself must be founded upon the infinite possibility for choice and accident. And if we cannot prove that it is, we must believe that it is. We must believe that we can change, that we can control, that we can direct our own destinies.

 - I don’t believe in anything and that makes me stronger than you think.
 - Life is a tragedy, one way or another. What is certain is that you die.
 - Say what you will to the force that governs the universe. Perhaps we’ll call it into being, and it will yet love us as we love it.

 - The worst takes its time to come, and then to pass.
 - What does it mean to die when you can live until the end of the world?
 - In the chapel you prayed to be a saint and now I will make you a god.
 - When we talk about our lives, long or short, brief and tragic or enduring beyond comprehension, we impose a continuity on them, and that continuity is a lie.
 - That was my nature – going from temptation after temptation, not to sin, but to be redeemed.
 - What I have always wanted more than revenge is to bring the other person to recognition of the pain they caused, so they essentially say, “I will never do that again.”
 - A perfect world or a world destroyed, one or the other- someday will come the end of hell.
 - We have to become saints. We have to become like Christ. Anything less is simply not enough.
 - The world doesn’t need any more mediocrity or hedged bets.
 - Revenge is the concern of those who are at some point or other beaten. I am not beaten, I told myself. No, not beaten. And victory is far more interesting to contemplate than revenge.
 - Perhaps this is the only real evil left.
 - I resolved to move just a little bit more slowly through the world, to look around myself with greater care, and to try to remain conscious of all that was going on around me at all times.
 - I’m usually working on my own mythology, my own realm of created characters. Stories in mythology inspire me, though I may not be conscious of it.
 - But all morality is of necessity shaped by context. I’m not talking relativism, no. To ignore the context of a decision is in fact immoral.
 - I wish we had more visible Christian and Catholic leaders who talked about love.
 - We have such a terrible, terrible misconception of science. We think it involves the definite, the precise, the known; it is a horrid series of gates to an unknown as vast of the universe; which means endless.
 - Goddamn it, do it yourself. You’re five hundred years old and you can’t use a telephone? Read the directions. What are you, an immortal idiot?

 - And I realized that I’d tolerated him this long because of self-doubt.
 - You never know the palette of the one you kill until the mind disgorges its finest colours.

 - The earth here is beautiful. And it still belongs to the dead.
 - That process by which you become a writer is a pretty lonely one. We don’t have a group apprenticeship like a violinist might training for an orchestra.
 - I know Christianity; and I know I have to move away from it and approach Jesus Christ on my own. I have to talk to Him directly and seek His guidance and protection as I seek to make my commitment to Him central to my life.

 - Then, are you master of us all? You didn’t teach her that. Was she supposed to imbibe it from my quiet subservience?
 - Re-telling the Christian story is the essence of my vocation. That has been going on since the Evangelists in one form or another.
 - I thought The Shining was just absolutely wonderful. Stephen King reaches all kinds of people. In the beginning he was just dismissed out of hand, which was terrible.

 - Wasn’t it his right to listen to opera, read poetry and adventure novels, go to Europe every couple of months for some reason or another, and drive his Porsche over the speed limit until he found out who he was?

 - I grabbed her ankle and kissed it, and when I looked up I saw her chin and her eyelashes as she threw back her head and laughed.
 - I no longer represent any organized religion. I’m not Catholic. I’m not Christian. I’m saying this because I have to be an outsider for Christ.
 - The truth is, laughter always sounds more perfect than weeping. Laughter flows in a violent riff and is effortlessly melodic. Weeping is often fought, choked, half strangled, or surrendered to with humiliation.
