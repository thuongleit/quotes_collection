 - Laziness is a programmers main virtue.
 - Programmers can be lazy.
 - Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.
 - Most of you are familiar with the virtues of a programmer. There are three, of course: laziness, impatience, and hubris.
 - Well, I think Perl should run faster than C.
 - There’s a saying in the software design industry: “Good. Fast. Cheap. Pick two.”
 - People get annoyed when you try to debug them.
 - Many days I don’t write any code at all, and some days I spend all day writing code.
 - Easy things should be easy, and hard things should be possible.
 - At many levels, Perl is a ‘diagonal’ language.
 - Computer programming is really a lot like writing a recipe. If you’ve read a recipe, you know what the structure of a recipe is, it’s got some things up at the top that are your ingredients, and below that, the directions for how to deal with those ingredients.
 - Call me bored, but don’t call me boring.
 - Take Lisp, you know its the most beautiful language in the world – at least up until Haskell came along.
 - The Harvard Law states: Under controlled conditions of light, temperature, humidity, and nutrition, the organism will do as it damn well pleases.
 - Just don’t create a file called.
 - Being famous has its benefits, but fame isn’t one of them.
 - Hubris itself will not let you be an artist.
 - You can’t change the past. You can’t even change the future, in the sense that you can only change the present one moment at a time, stubbornly, until the future unwinds itself into the stories of our lives.
 - I procrastinate, but mostly because there’s always too many things to do, and I got the stew in my mind that things do bubble up, so I’ll throw things in there and let them stew around. It’s sort of like greasing the squeaky wheels in my own brain.
 - To Perl, or not to Perl, that is the kvetching.
 - Perl is worse than Python because people wanted it worse.
 - The computer should be doing the hard work. That’s what it’s paid to do, after all.
 - I think computer science, by and large, is still stuck in the Modern age.
 - I note that the Python folks still think they like JPython. I wonder how long that will last?
 - A journey of a thousand miles continues with the second step.
 - For me, writing is a love-hate relationship.
 - A lazy person will try to always find some way to do something; they’ll always be looking for ways of doing something faster, more efficiently, and if you really want to control the world, that’s a really sort of hubristic notion – excessive pride, the thing that Zeus zaps you for having.
 - Unix is like a toll road on which you have to stop every 50 feet to pay another nickel. But hey! You only feel 5 cents poorer each time.
 - A good messenger expects to get shot.
 - You want it in one line? Does it have to fit in 80 columns?
 - We don’t have enough parallel universes to allow all uses of all junction types – in the absence of quantum computing the combinatorics are not in our favor...
 - Guilty as charged. Perl is happily ugly, and happily derivative.
 - I think it’s a new feature. Don’t tell anyone it was an accident.
 - Though I’ll admit readability suffers slightly...
 - A Perl program is correct if it gets the job done before your boss fires you.
 - Almost nothing in Perl serves a single purpose.
 - Over the long term, symbiosis is more useful than parasitism. More fun, too. Ask any mitochondria.
 - When in doubt, parenthesize. At the very least it will let some poor schmuck bounce on the % key in vi.
 - The camel has evolved to be relatively self-sufficient. On the other hand, the camel has not evolved to smell good. Neither has Perl.
 - Computer language design is just like a stroll in the park. Jurassic Park, that is.
 - I think I’ll side with the pissheads on this one.
 - Symmetry is overrated. Overrated is symmetry.
 - Well, coffee is my drug of choice, generally, with a little bit of Pepsi here and there, if I need more sugar. But yeah, if I could do intravenous coffee, I would. But I guess that’s pretty standard.
 - It is easier to port a shell than a shell script.
 - We all agree on the necessity of compromise. We just can’t agree on when it’s necessary to compromise.
 - The problem with being consistent is that there are lots of ways to be consistent, and they’re all inconsistent with each other.
 - Although the Perl Slogan is There’s More Than One Way to Do It, I hesitate to make 10 ways to do something.
 - I’ve decided I don’t want to be a manager. Every time you try to be responsive to your employees, they say you’re being reactive and not proactive. And when you try to be proactive, they accuse you of being capricious and arbitrary. So I don’t wanna be a manager...
 - This job of playing God is a little too big for me. Nevertheless, someone has to do it, so I’ll try my best to fake it.
 - For the sake of argument I’ll ignore all your fighting words.
 - It is my job in life to travel all roads, so that some may take the road less travelled, and others the road more travelled, and all have a pleasant day.
 - As pointed out in a followup, Real Perl Programmers prefer things to be visually distinct.
 - I was raised a musician and I played classic music, violin, in orchestras and music comedy theaters, I have music running around in my head all the time, and if I hear music that’s too interesting, I have to pay attention to it.
 - To be a good artist, you have to serve the work of art and allow it to be what it is supposed to be.
 - You can never entirely stop being what you once were. That’s why it’s important to be the right person today, and not put it off till tomorrow.
 - The potential of greater good goes right along with the potential for greater evil.
 - Sometimes I wish I could put an expiration date on my quotes.
 - Reserve your abuse for your true friends.
 - Computer languages differ not so much in what they make possible, but in what they make easy.
 - If any ideology is so serious that you can’t have fun while you’re doing it, it’s probably too serious.
 - Real theology is always rather shocking to people who already think they know what they think. I’m still shocked myself.
 - Are you perchance running on a 64-bit machine?
 - Basically there’s just so much stuff flowing past on the internet now, you have to let most of it go. And I’ve grown accustomed to the process of not worrying too much about the stuff I’m not getting to, because the important stuff will come back around.
 - But the possibility of abuse may be a good reason for leaving capabilities out of other computer languages, it’s not a good reason for leaving capabilities out of Perl .
 - When’s the last time you used duct tape on a duct?
 - The random quantum fluctuations of my brain are historical accidents that happen to have decided that the concepts of dynamic scoping and lexical scoping are orthogonal and should remain that way.
 - As a linguist, I don’t think of Ada as a big language. Now, English and Japanese, those are big languages. Ada is just a medium-sized language.
 - Portability should be the default.
 - Lisp has all the visual appeal of oatmeal with fingernail clippings mixed in.
 - I wouldn’t ever write the full sentence myself, but then, I never use goto either.
 - It’s appositival, if it’s there. And it doesn’t have to be there. And it’s really obvious that it’s there when it’s there.
 - Orthogonality for orthogonality’s sake is not something I’m keen on.
 - Let us be charitable, and call it a misleading feature.
 - I think software patents are a bad idea. Many patents are given for trivial inventions.
 - Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it’s still coming to computer science.

 - The autodecrement is not magical.
 - Don’t wear rollerskates to a tug-of-war.
 - If you write something wrong enough, I’ll be glad to make up a new witticism just for you.
 - Odd that we think definitions are definitive.
 - Even if you aren’t in doubt, consider the mental welfare of the person who has to maintain the code after you, and who will probably put parens in the wrong place.
 - The whole history of computers is rampant with cheerleading at best and bigotry at worst.
 - It would be possible to optimize some forms of goto, but I haven’t bothered.
 - I’m never satisfied because I’ve been always interested in too many things and I always want to do everything at once.
 - All language designers are arrogant. Goes with the territory...
 - I think the way IBM has embraced the open source philosophy has been quite astonishing, but gratifying. I hope they’ll do very well with it.
 - If you’re a large corporation, you can afford to pay the money to register patents, but if you’re an individual like me, you can’t.
 - Many computer scientists have fallen into the trap of trying to define languages like George Orwell’s Newspeak, in which it is impossible to think bad thoughts. What they end up doing is killing the creativity of programming.
 - What you’ll need most is courage. It is not an easy path that you’ve set your foot upon.
 - Information wants to be useful.
 - Perl doesn’t have an infatuation with enforced privacy. It would prefer that you stayed out of its living room because you weren’t invited, not because it has a shotgun.
 - Perhaps you should compile your Perl with long doubles one of these megaseconds.
 - You don’t have to know the whole language to use it usefully, you can do baby talk, you can do grown up talk, you can cuss in it, you can write poetry, you can be a playwright, is sort of the idea.
 - I want to see people using Perl to glue things together creatively, not just technically but also socially.
 - Younger hackers are hard to classify. They’re probably just as diverse as the old hackers are. We’re all over the map.
 - It’s certainly easy to calculate the average attendance for Perl conferences.

 - The purpose of most computer languages is to lengthen your resume by a word and a comma.
 - Just because you’re into control doesn’t mean you’re in control.
 - When I announced the development of Perl 6, I said it was going to be a community design. I designed Perl, myself. It’s limited by my own brain power. So I wanted Perl 6 to be a community design.
 - Think of prototypes as a funny markup language – the interpretation is left up to the rendering engine.
 - I’m a great believer in visual distinctions.
 - It should be illegal to yell ‘Y2K’ in a crowded economy.
 - I think I’m likely to be certified before Perl is...
 - It’s easy to solve the halting problem with a shotgun.
 - Yes, but I did manage to increase the amount of virginity in the world by that method.
 - A ‘goto’ in Perl falls into the category of hard things that should be possible, not easy things that should be easy.
 - And don’t tell me there isn’t one bit of difference between null and space, because that’s exactly how much difference there is.
 - I’m not too concerned about the future of Perl after me, because I see how these people are interacting with each other and even when I’m not there, they are helping each other and solving each other’s problems in a way that I could not do, even if I were there.
 - I don’t believe I’ve ever cuddled my elses.
 - There’s many scripting languages in the world, Perl is a little bit special because it is based more on some ideas from the way natural languages work.
 - I think operating systems work best if they’re free and open. Particular applications are more likely to be proprietary.
 - I’m afraid my gut level reaction is basically, proceed is cute, but cute doesn’t cut it in the emergency room.
 - I’m just paid to do whatever I want to do. Some of the time it’s development, and some of the time it’s just goofing off.
 - And besides, if Perl really takes off in the Windows space, I think the rest of us would just as soon have a double-agent within ActiveState.
 - You can’t have filenames longer than 14 chars. You can’t even think about them!
 - Human languages tend to be much more ambiguous than computer languages because humans are much smarter about interpreting the context.
 - It won’t be covered in the book. The source code has to be useful for something, after all...
 - Let’s say the docs present a simplified view of reality...
 - The trouble with being quoted a lot is that it makes other people think you’re quoting yourself when in fact you’re merely repeating yourself.
