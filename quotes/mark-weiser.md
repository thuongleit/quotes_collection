 - The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.
 - Long term, the PC and workstation will wither because computing access will be everywhere: in the walls, on wrists, and in ‘scrap computers’ lying about waiting to be grabbed as needed.
 - Machines that fit the human environment, instead of forcing humans to enter theirs, will make using a computer as refreshing as taking a walk in the woods.
