 - He who says he hates all kinds of flattery, and says so in earnest, has undoubtedly not as yet become acquainted with all kinds of it, whether in substance or in form.
 - It is a dangerous thing for the perfecting of our minds to gain applause by works that do not call forth the whole of our energies; for in that case one generally comes to a standstill.

One rarely procreates children at that age, but one is all the more skilled at educating those who have already been procreated, and education is procreation of another kind.

 - Sickness is mankind’s greatest defect.
 - As soon as you know a man to be blind, you imagine that you can see it from his back.

 - With God thoughts are colors, with us they are pigments-even the most abstract one may be accompanied by physical pain.

 - A man is never more serious than when he praise himself.
 - In every man there is something of all men.
