 - All glory comes from daring to begin.
 - Man builds no structure which outlives a book.
 - Life is a game of whist. From unseen sources The cards are shuffled, and the hands are dealt. I do not like the way the cards are shuffled, But yet I like the game and want to play.
 - Human hopes and human creeds; have their root in human needs.
 - No town can hope prosperity and trade, unless the press shall vigorously aid.
 - The farmer works the soil. The agriculturalist works the farmer.
