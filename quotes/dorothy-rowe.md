 - Depression is a prison where you are both the suffering prisoner and the cruel jailer.
 - We can love someone without understanding that person.
 - You will have no peace until you have discovered how to forgive yourself, to forgive other people and let them forgive you.
 - If you believe that you are bad and unacceptable, you are unable to look back at your past with pleasure or your future with hope. Only bad things happened to you in the past, and only bad things will happen to you in the future.
 - When a depressed person shrinks away from your touch it does not mean he is rejecting you. Rather he is protecting you from the foul, destructive evil which he believes is the essence of his being and which he believes can injure you.
 - We would like to believe that we are not in the business of surviving but in being good, and we do not like to admit to ourselves that we are good in order to survive.
 - However, when we are depressed, being reminded of other peopleâ€™s suffering only serves to increase our self-hatred.
