 - Massage therapy has been shown to relieve depression, especially in people who have chronic fatigue syndrome; other studies also suggest benefit for other populations.
 - I believe that it may be normal, healthy, and even productive to experience mild to moderate depression from time to time as part of the variable emotional spectrum, either as an appropriate response to situations or as a way of turning inward and mentally chewing over problems to find solutions.
 - You can’t afford to get sick, and you can’t depend on the present health care system to keep you well. It’s up to you to protect and maintain your body’s innate capacity for health and healing by making the right choices in how you live.
 - At the very center of our being is rhythmic movement, a cyclic expansion and contraction that is both in our body and outside it, that is both in our mind and in our body, that is both in our consciousness and not in it.
 - The bottom line is that the human body is complex and subtle, and oversimplifying – as common sense sometimes impels us to do – can be hazardous to your health.
 - Imagine a world in which medicine was oriented toward healing rather than disease, where doctors believed in the natural healing capacity of human beings and emphasized prevention above treatment. In such a world, doctors and patients would be partners working toward the same ends.
 - Practicing regular, mindful breathing can be calming and energizing and can even help with stress-related health problems ranging from panic attacks to digestive disorders.

 - Most disease is lifestyle related and preventable.
 - Improper breathing is a common cause of ill health.
 - Get people back into the kitchen and combat the trend toward processed food and fast food.

 - It is unrealistic to want to be happy all the time.
 - For many in the modern world, carving out time for both traditional seated meditation and exercise has become close to impossible.
 - Limit or eliminate late-night computer and television viewing. A computer or TV screen may seem much dimmer than a light bulb, but these screens often fill your field of vision, mimicking the effects of a room filled with light.

 - Please keep in mind the distinction between healing and treatment: treatment originates from outside, whereas healing comes from within.
 - My passion for gardening may strike some as selfish, or merely an act of resignation in the face of overwhelming problems that beset the world. It is neither. I have found that each garden is just what Voltaire proposed in Candide: a microcosm of a just and beautiful society.
 - I don’t think you can live without stress; I think the human life is stressful, and it probably always has been, although the forms of stress may change from culture to culture, and from time to time.
 - As any doctor can tell you, the most crucial step toward healing is having the right diagnosis. If the disease is precisely identified, a good resolution is far more likely. Conversely, a bad diagnosis usually means a bad outcome, no matter how skilled the physician.
 - Health is wholeness and balance, an inner resilience that allows you to meet the demands of living without being overwhelmed.
 - Remember that breath walking – as with any meditation technique – should not be pursued with a grim determination to ‘get it right.’ The point is to cultivate openness, relaxation and awareness, which can include awareness of your undisciplined, wandering mind.
 - We need to accept the seemingly obvious fact that a toxic environment can make people sick and that no amount of medical intervention can protect us. The health care community must become a powerful political lobby for environmental policy and legislation.
 - I do not claim to have attained optimum emotional well-being. Actually, I think that may be a lifetime goal. For me it’s an ongoing process that requires awareness, knowledge, and practice. I do know what good emotional health feels like, and that motivates me to keep at the practice.
 - We’re all affected by music. It has the power to inspire, uplift us, change our moods, and even alter consciousness.
 - True, nuts are high in fat, but most of them contain monounsaturated fat that is good for the heart. In fact, eaten in moderation, nuts can lower your risk of heart disease and heart attack.
 - My personal opinion is that the neutral position on the mood spectrum – what I called emotional sea level – is not happiness but rather contentment and the calm acceptance that is the goal of many kinds of spiritual practice.
 - In my view, prescribing antidepressant drugs is too often a quick and easy substitute for developing treatment plans that address the totality of health concerns and lifestyle factors that have an impact on wellness, including emotional wellness.
 - Dietary fat, whether saturated or not, is not a cause of obesity, heart disease or any other chronic disease of civilization.
 - I expect that essential oils may some day prove a vital weapon in the fight against strains of antibiotic-resi stant bacteria.
 - Giving gifts to others is a fundamental activity, as old as humanity itself. Yet in the modern, complex world, the particulars of gift-giving can be extraordinarily challenging.
 - If we can make the correct diagnosis, the healing can begin. If we can’t, both our personal health and our economy are doomed.
 - Another aspect of the psychedelic vision for me that has been very profound, is the sense that every-thing is alive or at that at least, there is no distinction between what we call living and non-living.
 - In the world at large, people are rewarded or punished in ways that are often utterly random. In the garden, cause and effect, labor and reward, are re-coupled. Gardening makes sense in a senseless world. By extension, then, the more gardens in the world, the more justice, the more sense is created.
 - Shorter daylight hours can affect sleep, productivity and state of mind. Light therapy, also known as phototherapy, may help. It uses light boxes emitting full-spectrum light to simulate sunlight.
 - Another very common use, in all cultures, of psychoactive substances is to give people transcendent experiences. To allow them to transcend their human and ego boundaries to feel greater contact with the supernatural, or with the spiritual, or with the divine, however they phrase it in their terms.

 - Clearly, America’s dysfunctional food culture must bear some of the blame for our excess pounds, but it’s likely our walking-averse lifestyles contribute as well.
 - I’m not against high-tech medicine. It has a secure place in the diagnosis and treatment of serious disease.
 - By keeping my hand in that, it’s the way I keep learning. The main way you learn in medicine is by practicing and working with patients.
 - Studies have shown that people who are physically active sleep better than those who are sedentary. The more energy you expend during the day, the sleepier you will feel at bedtime.
 - In Europe, when tobacco was first introduced, it was immediately banned. In Turkey, if you got caught with tobacco, you had your nose slit. China and Russia imposed the death penalty for possession of tobacco.
 - It does kids no favors, and sets them up for a potential lifetime of poor health and social embarrassment, to excuse them from family meals of real food. Everyone benefits from healthy eating, but it is particularly crucial at the beginning of life.
 - One of the most obvious ways dogs can improve our physical and mental health is via daily walks.
 - Any drug can be used successfully, no matter how bad it’s reputation, and any drug can be abused, no matter how accepted it is. There are no good or bad rugs; there are only good and bad relationships with drugs.
 - Fear and greed are potent motivators. When both of these forces push in the same direction, virtually no human being can resist.

 - The choice is ours: we can keep on craving what we don’t have, and so perpetuate our unhappiness, or we can adjust our attitude toward what we do have so that our expectations conform to our experience.
 - The usual justification for eating extra meals is that it keeps the metabolism ‘revved up’ so that weight loss is easier. There is, however, very little hard evidence that supports this idea, and a fair amount that disputes it.
 - The more people have, the less content they seem to be. In America, the cultural expectation that we’re to be happy all the time and our children are to be happy all the time is toxic, and I think that really gets in the way of emotional well-being.
 - More than one skillful physician has said that if one asks the right questions, the patient will make the diagnosis for you in his or her own words.
 - It is more important to eat some carbohydrates at breakfast, because the brain needs fuel right away, and carbohydrate is the best source.

 - Even low-calorie diets and vigorous exercise fail to work in the long term for at least some people.
 - To be clear, I worry as much about the impact of the Internet as anyone else. I worry about shortening attention spans, the physical cost of sedentary ‘surfing’ and the potential for coarsening discourse as millions of web pages compete for attention by appealing to our base instincts.
 - The more easily digestible and refined the carbohydrates, the greater the effect on our health, weight and well-being.
 - In my view, the best gift is one that benefits both the receiver and the planet.
