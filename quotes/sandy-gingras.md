 - Lost is just another word for exploring.
 - At the beach, life is different. A day moves not from hour to hour but leaps from mood to moment. We go with the currents, plan around the tides, follow the sun. We measure happiness by nothing we can hold, nothing we can catch. Everywhere, life is jumping and elusive and momentously momentary.
 - A beach walk is for stretching your legs and your mind, for looking at life with newfound eyes.
 - At the beach, life is different. Time doesnâ€™t move hour to hour but mood to moment. We live by the currents, plan by the tides, and follow the sun.
