 - I wanted only to live in accord with the promptings which came from my true self. Why was that so very difficult?

 - Words can not express the joy of new life.
 - I have had to experience so much stupidity, so many vices, so much error, so much nausea, disillusionment and sorrow, just in order to become a child again and begin anew. I had to experience despair, I had to sink to the greatest mental depths, to thoughts of suicide, in order to experience grace.
 - The river is everywhere.
 - Happiness is love, nothing else.
 - Art is the contemplation of the world in a state of grace.
 - The river has taught me to listen; you will learn from it, too. The river knows everything; one can learn everything from it. You have already learned from the river that it is good to strive downwards, to sink, to seek the depths.
 - When you like someone, you like them in spite of their faults. When you love someone, you love them with their faults.
