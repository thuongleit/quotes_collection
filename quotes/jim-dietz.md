 - Rowing is a sport for dreamers. As long as you put in the work, you can own the dream.
 - In rowing as in life, there are competitors and there are racers. The competitor works hard and rows to his limit. The racer does not think of limits, only the race.
 - If you want to know why you didn’t make a boat – I’ll tell you. You’re just out there hammering the water. You’re killing fish, not rowing.
