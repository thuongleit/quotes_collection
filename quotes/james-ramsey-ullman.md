 - Challenge is the core and the mainspring of all human activity. If there’s an ocean, we cross it; if there’s a disease, we cure it; if there’s a wrong, we right it; if there’s a record, we break it; and finally, if there’s a mountain, we climb it.
 - We are so clothed in rationalization and dissemblance that we can recognize but dimly the deep primal impulses that motivate us.
 - It is the ultimate wisdom of the mountains that a man is never more a man than when he is striving for what is beyond his grasp.
 - It was not a mere man he was holding, but a giant; or a block of granite. The pull was unendurable. The pain unendurable.
 - To know a little less and to understand a little more: that, it seems to me, is our greatest need.
