 - Books may well be the only true magic.
 - Once you know some things, you can’t unknow them. It’s a burden that can never be given away.

 - Unrequited love is so boring. Weeping under a blue-black sky is for suckers or maniacs.
 - Our rest is formed by our waking life and our waking life is formed by our sorrows.

 - Some things, when they change, never do return to the way they once were. Butterflies for instance, and women who’ve been in love with the wrong man too often.
 - In losing a friend, she is reminded of all she has lost and all she stands to lose again. There is nothing to be done to make it any easier. We all grieve alone.
 - Feel lucky for what you have when you have it. Isn’t that the point? Happily ever after doesn’t mean happy forever. The ever after, what precisely was that? Your dreams, your life, your death, your everything. Was it the blank space that went on without us? The forever after we were gone?
