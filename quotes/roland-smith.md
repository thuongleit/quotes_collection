 - The only thing you’ll find on the summit of Mount Everest is a divine view. The things that really matter lie far below.
 - You can never tell you the mountain will allow and who it will not.
 - You don’t have to be alone to feel alone.
 - For a climber, saying that you are stopping by Everest is like saying that you are stopping by to see God.
 - A partner can encourage you, maybe even stop you from falling, but they can’t get you to the top. That’s entirely up to you.
 - There’s nothing wrong with a little fear. Being fearful can save your life-it’s saved mine on more than one occasion-but too much fear can stop you from living.
 - My heavenly citizenship makes the whole world a foreign mission field.
