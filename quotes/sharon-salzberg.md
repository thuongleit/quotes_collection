 - Mindfulness isn’t difficult, we just need to remember to do it.
 - Meditation trains the mind the way physical exercise strengthens the body.
 - Loving-kindness and compassion are the basis for wise, powerful, sometimes gentle, and sometimes fierce actions that can really make a difference – in our own lives and those of others.
 - To remember non-attachment is to remember what freedom is all about. If we get attached, even to a beautiful state of being, we are caught, and ultimately we will suffer. We work to observe anything that comes our way, experience it while it is here, and be able to let go of it.
 - Detachment is not about refusing to feel or not caring or turning away from those you love. Detachment is profoundly honest, grounded firmly in the truth of what is.
 - Life is like an ever-shifting kaleidoscope – a slight change, and all patterns alter.

 - Restore your attention or bring it to a new level by dramatically slowing down whatever you’re doing.
 - Resilience is based on compassion for ourselves as well as compassion for others.
 - Find a gap between a trigger event and our usual conditioned response to it and by using that pause to collect ourselves and shift our response.

 - Develop a mind so filled with love that it resembles space.
 - You are capable of so much more than we usually dare to imagine.
 - Metta sees truly that our integrity is inviolate, no matter what our life situation may be. We do not need to fear anything. We are whole: our deepest happiness is intrinsic to the nature of our minds, and it is not damaged through uncertainty and change.
 - Patience doesn’t mean making a pact with the devil of denial, ignoring our emotions and aspirations. It means being wholeheartedly engaged in the process that’s unfolding, rather than ripping open a budding flower or demanding a caterpillar hurry up and get that chrysalis stage over with.
 - When you’re wide open, the world is a good place.
 - Meditation is the ultimate mobile device; you can use it anywhere, anytime, unobtrusively.
 - From the Buddhist point of view, it is true that emptiness is a characteristic of all of life – if we look carefully at any experience we will find transparency, insubstantiality, with no solid, unchanging core to our experience. But that does not mean that nothing matters.

 - Every single moment is expressive of the truth of our lives when we know how to look.

 - Distraction wastes our energy, concentration restores it.
 - Each decision we make, each action we take, is born out of an intention.
 - What unites us as human beings is an urge for happiness which at heart is a yearning for union.
 - Love as a power can go anywhere. It isn’t sentimental. It doesn’t have to be pretty, yet it doesn’t deny pain.
 - We can learn the art of fierce compassion – redefining strength, deconstructing isolation and renewing a sense of community, practicing letting go of rigid us-vs.-them thinking – while cultivating power and clarity in response to difficult situations.
 - When we practice metta, we open continuously to the truth of our actual experience, changing our relationship to life.
 - As we look around, it’s very clear that in this world people do outrageous things to one another all of the time. It’s not that these qualities or actions make us bad people, but they bring tremendous suffering if we don’t know how to work with them.
 - As an ability, love is always there as a potential, ready to flourish and help our lives flourish. As we go up and down in life, as we acquire or lose, as we are showered with praise or unfairly blamed, always within there is the ability of love, recognized or not, given life or not.

 - We learn and grow and are transformed not so much by what we do but by why and how we do it.
 - Love and concern for all are not things some of us are born with and others are not. Rather, they are results of what we do with our minds: We can choose to transform our minds so that they embody love, or we can allow them to develop habits and false concepts of separation.
 - By engaging in a delusive quest for happiness, we bring only suffering upon ourselves. In our frantic search for something to quench our thirst, we overlook the water all around us and drive ourselves into exile from our own lives.
 - The movement of the heart as we practice generosity in the outer world mirrors the movement of the heart when we let go of conditioned views about ourselves on our inner journey. Letting go creates a joyful sense of space in our minds.
 - All beings want to be happy, yet so very few know how. It is out of ignorance that any of us cause suffering, for ourselves or for others.
 - We apply our effort to be mindful, to be aware in this very moment, right here and now, and we bring a very wholehearted effort to it. This brings concentration. It is this power of concentration that we use to cut through the world of surface appearances to get to a much deeper reality.
 - Training our mind through meditation does not mean forcibly subjugating it or beating it into shape.
 - Meditation is a microcosm, a model, a mirror. The skills we practice when we sit are transferable to the rest of our lives.
 - The meditation traditions I started and have continued practicing have all emphasized inclusivity: anyone can do this who is interested.
 - Sometimes people don’t trust the force of kindness. They think love or compassion or kindness will make you weak and kind of stupid and people will take advantage of you; you won’t stand up for other people.
 - Things don’t just happen in this world of arising and passing away. We don’t live in some kind of crazy, accidental universe. Things happen according to certain laws, laws of nature. Laws such as the law of karma, which teaches us that as a certain seed gets planted, so will that fruit be.
 - Pure generosity emerges when we give without the need for our offering to be received in a certain way. That’s why the best kind of generosity comes from inner abundance, rather than from feeling deficient and hollow, starved for validation.

 - Meditation is a tool for helping us accept the profound fact that everything changes all the time.
 - Someone who has experienced trauma also has gifts to offer all of us – in their depth, their knowledge of our universal vulnerability, and their experience of the power of compassion.
 - We spend our lives searching for something we think we don’t have, something that will make us happy. But the key to our deepest happiness lies in changing our vision of where to seek it.
 - You should never use the word Karma when talking about someone else, it’s only a concept you should apply to yourself as a matter of investigation.
 - There is no ‘thing’ to let go of, but a concept, an idea of an ego that burdens us. As soon as we posit a ‘thing’ to let go of, we’re in trouble. We need to change our view of reality, not attack a nonexistent entity.
 - The art of concentration is a continual letting go. We let go of what is inessential or distracting. We let go of a thought or a feeling, not because we are afraid of it or because we can’t bear to acknowledge it as a part of our experience; but, because it is UNNECESSARY.
 - We often get caught up in our own reactions and forget the vulnerability of the person in front of us.

 - Fearful of wasting a second, we hoard time as if it were money.
 - To cherish others is to cherish ourselves. To cherish ourselves is to cherish others. And in that same way, we relate to the truth. If we support it, if we embrace it, if we uphold it, we will be embraced by it, we will be supported and upheld by it.

 - Its never too late to take a moment to look.
 - I call myself a meditation teacher rather than a spiritual teacher.
 - When we are devoted to the development of kindness, it becomes our ready response, so that reacting from compassion, from caring, is not a question of giving ourselves a lecture: ‘I don’t really feel like it, but I’d better be helpful, or what would people think?’
 - Compassion grows in us when we know how the energy of love is available all around us.
