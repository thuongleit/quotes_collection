 - People think of education as something they can finish.
 - However, I continue to try and I continue, indefatigably, to reach out. There’s no way I can single-handedly save the world or, perhaps, even make a perceptible difference – but how ashamed I would be to let a day pass without making one more effort.

 - The day you stop learning is the day you begin decaying.
 - Science can amuse and fascinate us all, but it is engineering that changes the world.

 - Economics is on the side of humanity now.
 - The greatest weapons in the conquest of knowledge are an understanding mind and the inexorable curiosity that drives it on.
 - If all human beings understood history, they might cease making the same stupid mistakes over and over.

 - And in man is a three-pound brain which, as far as we know, is the most complex and orderly arrangement of matter in the universe.
 - My feeling is that as far as creativity is concerned, isolation is required. Creation is embarrassing. For every new good idea you have, there are a hundred, ten thousand foolish ones.
 - I wish that I could say I was optimistic about the human race. I love us all, but we are so stupid and shortsighted that I wonder if we can lift our eyes to the world about us long enough not to commit suicide.
 - We are reaching the stage where the problems we must solve are going to become insoluble without computers. I do not fear computers, I fear the lack of them.

 - It is not so much that I have confidence in scientists being right, but that I have so much in nonscientists being wrong.
 - The human brain, then, is the most complicated organization of matter that we know.

 - Creationists make it sound as though a ‘theory’ is something you dreamt up after being drunk all night.
 - There are so many benefits to be derived from space exploration and exploitation; why not take what seems to me the only chance of escaping what is otherwise the sure destruction of all that humanity has struggled to achieve for 50,000 years?
 - What is really amazing, and frustrating, is mankind’s habit of refusing to see the obvious and inevitable until it is there, and then muttering about unforeseen catastrophes.
 - There are no happy endings in history, only crisis points that pass.
 - It is the obvious which is so difficult to see most of the time. People say ‘It’s as plain as the nose on your face.’ But how much of the nose on your face can you see, unless someone holds a mirror up to you?
 - The dangers that face the world can, every one of them, be traced back to science. The salvations that may save the world will, every one of them, be traced back to science.
 - Life originated in the sea, and about eighty percent of it is still there.
 - The laws of history are as absolute as the laws of physics, and if the probabilities of error are greater, it is only because history does not deal with as many humans as physics does atoms, so that individual variations count for more.

 - You show me someone who can’t understand people and I’ll show you someone who has built up a false image of himself.
 - If you have talent, you will receive some measure of success – but only if you persist.
 - Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo.

 - I am the beneficiary of a lucky break in the genetic sweepstakes.

 - Radiation, unlike smoking, drinking, and overeating, gives no pleasure, so the possible victims object.
