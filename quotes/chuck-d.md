 - What made me want to become a recording artist; I was the first artist that was repeatedly asked by a label to record with them. That label was Def Jam Records.
 - Rap comes from the humble beginnings of rebelling against the status quo. Now, rappers have become the status quo themselves. You can’t rebel against the Queen and then become the Queen yourself. I attribute much of the blame to testosterone-male dominance and patriarchy.
 - The Illuminati is just the evil, ‘nameless’ people who are behind governments.

 - I’m a multi-tasker. I was down with that stuff before they invented the term.
 - I became tired of submitting my art to a panel of corporate strategists who decide if it meets their standard of what gets into stores or not. It was quite simple for me: they act like judge and jury of my art, and that is unacceptable. I wanted to give it right to the public.

 - I grew up as a sports fan, and I know that a hall of fame is very different than an award for being the best of the year. It’s a nod to the longevity of our accomplishment.

 - Don’t anoint me when you can anoint yourself.
 - The Internet is one area that I have used pretty effectively to break free of corporate control.
 - You should be a person inside the world with knowledge of your terrain. And if you lock yourself into the 2,000-by-3,000-square-mile, lower-48 box of the United States, you’re going to be frustrated by its limitations. You gotta think outside the box.

 - I think the Internet was the saving grace for Public Enemy. Before that, travelling the world saved Public Enemy.
 - One of the problems with hip hop is lack of infrastructure and not being able to control its own course. I don’t like that hip hop is full of infantile 35-year-olds. Hip hop cannot afford to be lazy.

 - It’s not about what you get out but what you put into hip hop as a genre.

 - There’s nothing worse than a good video and good song, and you see a band and hate them because they can’t perform. That’s wack.
 - Real people do real things. A collective of a whole bunch of people who do things in their own locale, in their own neighborhoods – the sum is bigger than the parts, and the parts will grow.
 - Your closest and your most dedicated fans will be your ultimate test. They will test you.

 - Public Enemy is the security of the hip-hop party.
 - I always remain optimistic. There are three levels of music production: the majors, indies, and what I call “inties,” music distributed via the Internet. The Internet is one area that I have used pretty effectively to break free of corporate control.
 - I think governments are the cancer of civilization.
 - Most artists are always fighting for their fame. They have that fear, like the saying goes, “out of sight, out of mind.” They need to keep themselves out there. I have never had that fear. If I have any fear, it’s not doing enough to reach people.
 - I was inspired by the classic rock radio of the Seventies. They separated Chuck Berry and the Beatles from the Led Zeppelins and Bostons and Peter Framptons of the time. In many ways, classic rock became bigger than mainstream rock.

 - People aren’t going to support an artist just because they have an audio file. They have to feel a real connection.
 - Of course voting is useful. But then again, I don’t put a big glow to it. Voting is about as essential as washing yourself. It’s something you’re supposed to do. Now, you can’t go around bragging, expecting to get props because you voted. That’s stupid.

 - You can’t master time, but you have to work your hardest to manage it.
 - I think right about now we have to beware of marketed Malcolms and Martins. Real people do real things.

 - I’m recording freely, and if I make a song, I release it immediately, so I’m more likely to believe in one song at a time as opposed to albums.
 - So, rather than trying to humbly mix with the rest of the world, we are forcing ourselves upon it. We seem to create conflicts with everyone.
 - I like Rick Ross as a person. I like Jay-Z and Kanye West as people. But I hate the companies that they record for.
 - Some artists are told what to like and told definitions of what the music business is. That’s a problem. Music is artistry, and you want your music heard, your act known. But artists don’t know. They are ignorant the minute they sign a contract.
 - I encourage more blacks and people of color to get a passport. That’s one way to help put people on an equal platform.

 - I think traveling the world has helped to keep Public Enemy alive. We’ve never solely depended on the United States.
 - My mother went to university, my father didn’t. But they are very educated, very wise people. My father went to the military, so he’s worldly.
