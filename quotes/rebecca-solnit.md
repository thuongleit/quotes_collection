 - Politics is pervasive. Everything is political and the choice to be “apolitical” is usually just an endorsement of the status quo and the unexamined life.
 - The stars we are given. The constellations we make. That is to say, stars exist in the cosmos, but constellations are the imaginary lines we draw between them, the readings we give the sky, the stories we tell.
 - Leave the door open for the unknown, the door into the dark. That’s where the most important things come from, where you yourself came from, and where you will go.
 - Perfection is a stick with which to beat the possible.
 - Before writers are writers they are readers, living in books, through books, in the lives of others that are also the heads of others, in that act that is so intimate and yet so alone.
 - A book is a heart that only beats in the chest of another.
 - A place is a story, and stories are geography, and empathy is first of all an act of imagination, a storyteller’s art, and then a way of traveling from here to there.
 - Sense of place is the sixth sense, an internal compass and map made by memory and spatial perception together.
 - We have only the language for fun and miserable, and maybe we need language for deep and shallow, meaningful and meaningless.
 - There are disasters that are entirely manmade, but none that are entirely natural.
 - Never turn down an adventure without a really good reason.
 - To be hopeful means to be uncertain about the future, to be tender toward possibilities, to be dedicated to change all the way down to the bottom of your heart.
 - Credibility is a basic survival tool.
 - I think one of the primary goals of a feminist landscape architecture would be to work toward a public landscape in which we can roam the streets at midnight, in which every square is available for Virginia Woolf to make up her novels.
 - To hope is to give yourself to the future – and that commitment to the future is what makes the present inhabitable.
 - Getting lost was not a matter of geography so much as identity, a passionate desire, even an urgent need, to become no one and anyone, to shake off the shackles that remind you who you are, who others think you are.
 - There are fossils of seashells high in the Himalayas; what was and what is are different things.
 - Lost really has two disparate meanings. Losing things is about the familiar falling away, getting lost is about the unfamiliar appearing.
 - Thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a production-oriented society, and doing nothing is hard to do. It’s best done by disguising it as doing something, and the something closest to doing nothing is walking.
 - Given a choice between their worldview and the facts, it’s always interesting how many people toss the facts.
 - Walking articulates both physical and mental freedom.
 - A lone walker is both present and detached, more than an audience but less than a participant. Walking assuages or legitimizes this alienation.
 - How will you go about finding that thing the nature of which is totally unknown to you?

 - We make ourselves large or small, here or there, in our empathies.
 - The art is not one of forgetting but letting go. And when everything else is gone, you can be rich in loss.
 - There are infinite shades of grey. Writing often appears so black and white.
 - Modern life is moving faster than the speed of thought, or thoughtfulness.
 - To lose yourself: a voluptuous surrender, lost in your arms, lost to the world, utterly immersed in what is present so that its surroundings fade away. In Benjamin’s terms, to be lost is to be fully present, and to be fully present is to be capable of being in uncertainty and mystery.
 - The process of transformation consists mostly of decay.
 - Some things we have only as long as they remain lost, some things are not lost only so long as they are distant.
 - Beauty is often spoken of as though it only stirs lust or admiration, but the most beautiful people are so in a way that makes them look like destiny or fate or meaning, the heroes of a remarkable story.
 - A city always contains more than any inhabitant can know, and a great city always makes the unknown and the possible spurs to the imagination.
 - If sorrow and beauty are all tied up together, then perhaps maturity brings with it not what Nabhan calls abstraction, but an aesthetic sense that partially redeems the losses time brings and finds beauty in the faraway.

 - You get lost out of a desire to be lost. But in the place called lost strange things are found...
 - The magic of the street is the mingling of the errand and the epiphany.
 - Walking itself is the intentional act closest to the unwilled rhythms of the body, to breathing and the beating of the heart. It strikes a delicate balance between working and idling, being and doing. It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals.
 - We are moving into a world of unaccountable and secretive corporations that manage all our communications and work hand in hand with governments to make us visible to them. Our privacy is being strip-mined and hoarded.
 - Never to get lost is not to live, not to know how to get lost brings you to destruction.
 - For me, being in a car or on an airplane is like being in limbo. It’s this dead zone between two places. But to walk, you’re some place that’s already interesting. You’re not just between places. Things are happening.
 - We fly; we dream in darkness; we devour heaven in bites too small to be measured.
 - There is no one as dangerous as he or she who has nothing to lose.
 - I walk wherever my errands take me.
 - The things we want are transformative, and we don’t know or only think we know what is on the other side of that transformation Never to get lost is not to live.
 - You write your books. You scatter your seeds. Rats might eat them, or they might rot. In California, some seeds lie dormant for decades because they only germinate after fire, and sometimes the burned landscape blooms most lavishly.

 - Growing up north of San Francisco, I immersed myself in the local landscape and in books about Native Americans, cowboys, and pioneers that seemed to ground me in it, but to pursue culture in those days meant being spun around until dizzy and then pushed east.
 - For me, childhood roaming was what developed self-reliance, a sense of direction and adventure, imagination, a will to explore, to be able to get a little lost and then figure out the way back.
 - People rescue each other. They build shelters and community kitchens and ways to deal with lost children and eventually rebuild one way or another.

 - Roads are a record of those who have gone before.
 - The fight for free space-for wilderness and for public space-must be accompanied by a fight for free time to spend wandering in that space. Otherwise the individual imagination will be bulldozed over for the chain-store outlets of consumer appetite, true-crime titillations, and celebrity crises.
 - Eduardo Galeano notes that America was conquered, but not discovered, that the men who arrived with a religion to impose and dreams of gold never really knew where they were, and that this discovery is still taking place in our time.

 - Italian cities have long been held up as ideals, not least by New Yorkers and Londoners enthralled by the ways their architecture gives beauty and meaning to everyday acts.

 - Space – as landscape, terrain, spectacle, experience – has vanished.
 - To write is to carve a new path through the terrain of the imagination, or to point out new features on a familiar route. To read is to travel through that terrain with the author as a guide – a guide one might not always agree with or trust, but who can at least be counted on to take one somewhere.
 - The great majority of people are calm, resourceful, altruistic or even beyond altruistic, as they risk themselves for others. We improvise the conditions of survival beautifully.
