 - I try to be appreciative of what I have instead of bitter about what I’ve lost.
 - But really, what else are you going to talk about in line at the liquor store? Childhood trauma seems like the natural choice, since it’s the reason why most of us are in line there to begin with.
 - Every time I get scared or feel like I’m not going to be good enough at something, I say that mantra to myself. “Pretend you’re good at it.”
 - There’s so much shame involved in not being like everyone else. But I learned that the things that made me unique were good. Dealing with problems can be awful. But in the end I got positive results. I don’t think I would have been a writer if I didn’t have anxiety.
 - I can finally see that all the terrible parts of my life, the embarrassing parts, the incidents I wanted to pretend never happened, and the things that make me “weird” and “different,” were actually the most important parts of my life. They were the parts that made me ME.
 - It’s amazing how much you’re missing in a depressive state until you start to come out on the other side. It’s like breathing again after being underwater for far too long.

 - One ox, two oxen. One fox, two foxen.

 - I had no idea how complicated and solitary it could be to write a simple book.
 - I’m pretty sure ‘ferral cats’ is code for ’vampire cougars.
 - When I was little, my father used to sell guns and ammo at a sporting goods store, but I always told everyone he was an arms dealer, because it sounded more exciting.
 - When I was in junior high I read a lot of Danielle Steele. So I always assumed that the day I got engaged I’d be naked, covered in rose petals, and sleeping with the brother of the man who’d kidnapped me.
 - When I was young, my family didn’t go on outings to the circus or trips to Disneyland. We couldn’t afford them. Instead, we stayed in our small rural West Texas town, and my parents took us to cemeteries.
 - The hardest thing to write was explaining what anxiety feels like. Every time I’d try to really write about what it feels like to have an anxiety attack, I would actually have an anxiety attack. It was good material but so incredibly uncomfortable.

 - That night I looked up at those same stars, but I didn’t want any of those things. I didn’t want Egypt, or France, or far-flung destinations. I just wanted to go back to my life from my childhood, just to visit it, and touch it, and to convince myself that yes, it had been real.

 - A house should look lived in, and I consider it clean as long as I don’t stick to it and it doesn’t give me cholera.
 - I picked up the phone to call the police, but then I considered how it would sound when I told them that I was calling from inside my bathroom, where I’d OD’ed on laxatives, and that a possible rapist was quietly passing me notes under the bathroom door.
 - I very much own the fact that I’m a misfit. The Internet makes everyone realize they’re screwed up.
 - In fact almost everyone in my yearbook wrote the same thing to me: “To weird girl, you’re nice.” I didn’t think it was bad. When I showed my mother she said, “Everyone is different.” Being weird became my tool. I’m weird; that’s who I am. It was my coping badge.
 - Writing is my therapy. In addition to my real therapy. God knows where I’d be without it. I’d probably still be at my last job, working in HR at a religious organization. I was horribly miscast.
 - It’s interesting with my blog, because it feels to me less like a blog and more like a forum, because my readers are so funny and leave hysterical comments. And I’m not being humble when I say that very often, the comments are so much better than the post originally was.

 - When Hailey was born my first thought was that I needed a drink and that hospitals should have bars in them.
 - Like books, the Internet has saved my life. It helped me recognize that so many people I adore suffer from the same things I do.
 - People assume that because I’m a girl and my blog is hot pink that my readership is 90% women, but it’s not. It’s probably only about 65%. When I do tours, it’s pretty much the same thing: it’s about one-third guys.
