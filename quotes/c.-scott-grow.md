 - Ask God for forgiveness. Seek forgiveness from those you have wronged. Forgive those who have wronged you. Forgive yourself.
 - When we sin, Satan tells us we are lost. In contrast, our Redeemer offers redemption to all – no matter what we have done wrong – even to you and to me.
 - There is no sin or transgression, pain or sorrow, which is outside of the healing power of His Atonement.
 - When we repent, the Lord allows us to put the mistakes of the past behind us.
 - Through His Atonement, He heals not only the transgressor, but He also heals the innocent who suffer because of those transgressions. As the innocent exercise faith in the Savior and in His Atonement and forgive the transgressor, they too can be healed.
