 - Character is forged not on the mountaintop but in the valley.
 - Nothing worth doing right is easy.
 - I didn’t feel good today- little things here and there- but that’s the nature of this game. You just keep pushing, being mentally and physically ready. Some days are better than others, but even if you don’t feel so good, you get yourself going.
 - I believe that the time to start thinking about your legacy is not at the end but at the beginning, because as I said, that’s when you’re able to do something about it.
