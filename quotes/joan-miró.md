 - I work like a gardener.
 - A simple line painted with the brush can lead to freedom and happiness.
 - More important than a work of art itself is what it will sow. Art can die, a painting can disappear. What counts is the seed.
 - My way is to seize an image the moment it has formed in my mind, to trap it as a bird and to pin it at once to canvas. Afterward I start to tame it, to master it. I bring it under control and I develop it.
 - The more ignoble I find life, the more strongly I react by contradiction, in humour and in an outburst of liberty and expansion.

 - The spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. Im overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains – everything which is bare has always greatly impressed me.
 - I think of my studio as a vegetable garden, where things follow their natural course. They grow, they ripen. You have to graft. You have to water.

 - Painting or poetry is made as one makes love – a total embrace, prudence thrown to the winds, nothing held back.
 - For me, a painting must give off sparks. It must dazzle like the beauty of a woman or a poem.
 - I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.

 - Little by little, I’ve reached the stage of using only a small number of forms and colors. It’s not the first time that painting has been done with a very narrow range of colors. The frescoes of the tenth century are painted like this. For me, they are magnificent things.
 - My characters have undergone the same process of simplification as the colors. Now that they have been simplified, they appear more human and alive than if they had been represented in all their details.
