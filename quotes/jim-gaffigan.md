 - The DC Improv food is amazingly edible for a comedy club.

 - As an actor, you deal with so much rejection and humiliation. When the good things come around, you tend not to trust your instincts.

 - Some people that work for Hot Pockets came to my Denver Paramount Theater show. They brought these hot pocket boxes the size of suit cases for me to sign. I wrote “these are WMD’s” on the boxes. The HP people seem to have a good sense of humor about all of it.

 - It really never came up, but I think that in present-day America, they’re – you know, and I touched on it in the initial clip – is that we are in the middle of this culture war.
 - I think growing up in Indiana prepares anyone for a life in comedy. I do feel like there is a certain kind of self-effacing cynicism among all Hoosiers.
 - You ever talk about a movie with someone that read the book? They’re always so condescending. ‘Ah, the book was much better than the movie.’ Oh really? What I enjoyed about the movie: no reading.
 - I realized, in removing or rewriting these jokes, that often the jokes weren’t done or that I was using, for me, the curse words as kind of a crutch. So then I just started writing.
 - They always give you three ketchup packets. When you go back up and ask for more, the guy handing them out always treats you like you’re taking from his personal stash. “Looks like my kids aren’t having ketchup tonight.”
 - Thanksgiving. It’s like we didn’t even try to come up with a tradition. The tradition is, we overeat. ‘Hey, how about at Thanksgiving we just eat a lot?’ ‘But we do that every day!’ ‘Oh. What if we eat a lot with people that annoy the hell out of us?’
 - You ever buy a book and not read it? You feel almost guilty having it up on a bookshelf. People are like, “Hey, how’s that book?” “I haven’t read it.” “Oh, did you just buy it?” “I’ve had it since high school.” “Well, can I borrow it?” “No.”
 - If you’re a guy over 30 by yourself in the hotel pool, you automatically look like a murderer who’s just relaxing after he strangled a family. “Yeah-that dad was a tough one to kill.”
 - No one goes into standup to make money. The frustration and rejection are just too much.
 - It’s good to be back in New York. I have lived here ten years. I’m originally from Indiana. I know what most of you are thinking: Indiana: Mafia. But the fact of the matter is where I grew up there was something very similar to the Mafia: 4-H.
 - Stand-up is an amazing art form, I think, because it’s all about you having complete control of the situation, but absolutely none.
 - I love stand-up comedians. I really do.
 - I didn’t choose to be the guy who talks about the mundane – it’s just who I am and it’s what kind of works for me.
 - It doesn’t matter if you’re religious or not. Does anything make you feel more uncomfortable than some stranger going, I’d like to talk to you about Jesus?
 - If only opening a Vitamin Water could be classified as working out.
 - The reason I say I’m a horrible person is I don’t want myself to be presented as somebody who’s a great Catholic.
 - I was raised in a family where my father was the first one to go to college.

 - I grew up 45 minutes outside of Chicago.
 - We wrote about having five kids and bringing them to church. A journalist at The Washington Post wrote this article where the headline was “The New Catholic Evangelism Of Jim Gaffigan.” And it was a bit terrifying.

 - My comedy is romanticized laziness.
 - Comedians rarely have writers, and if you do it’s usually a sign of laziness.
 - I think I grew up with the idea that God was a punishing being, constructed around rules.
 - Comedians kind of write what comes to them. You can give yourself little assignments, but it’s what inspires you.
 - I’d been acting and doing stand-up in New York about eight years, getting rejected, and I finally got the opportunity to do stand-up on Letterman, which holds even more importance for me. With comedians, that’s definitely the pinnacle, but being from Indiana, it was a big to-do.
 - For a comedian to kind of catch onto something right as something’s catching on in our culture, a lot of it is luck, and you hope the joke is funny.
 - We tend to outdo ourselves.
 - I don’t want to get involved in the culture war. Religion’s iffy.
 - There’s a certain balance between finding an opportunity to do what you really enjoy and getting caught up in the flattery of people wanting you to do things.
 - But in Indiana it’s not like New York where everyone’s like, ‘We’re from New York and we’re the best’ or ‘We’re from Texas and we like things big’ it’s more like ‘We’re from Indiana and we’re gonna move.’
 - Wouldn’t it have been weird to go to high school with the Pope? You know, somebody did, someone’s sitting at home, watching TV in Poland, they see the Pope, they think, “That guy was a jerk! He was so mean to me and now he’s Pope? I got a swirly from the Pope!”
 - Bacon is like the opposite of medicine. It’s like, “Take that, Lipitor.”
 - Actually, the reason I look like this is because my father was from Sweden and my mother was Elton John.
 - I was always told that Hoosier came from when settlers in the state, when a stranger came on their property they’d say, “Who’s there? Who’s there?” So people that were from Indiana were the people that said “Who’s there?” But what do I know? I don’t read or interact with people outside the Internet.
 - It’s amazing how email has changed our lives. You ever get a handwritten letter in the mail today? ‘What the? Has someone been kidnapped?’
 - A lot of people are like, “You’re doing commercials?” And I honestly feel like those Sierra Mist commercials are better than a lot of sitcoms I get offered. It’s hard work, and I’m paid a lot of money, and I do it because I love the soda.
 - I was able to make the jump to theaters without having a TV show. My passion for getting a TV show just plummeted. It was like I had already achieved what I wanted to achieve.
 - It’s a balancing act of you feel horrible that you’re away but there is something about the road that is rather liberating.
 - A lot of the teachings really kind of keep me grounded.
 - There’s something that’s really fun about the challenge of making the mundane funny, too, I think.
 - Comics write to their point of view. If you’re an exceedingly irreverent comedian, you’ve got to see where that point of view fits or produces the most funny.
 - I worked on ‘USA Today’ as a topic for while. I tried to do something on hand chairs, chairs that look like hands. I really tried. But some topics are not truly universal.
 - There’s something about being a parent that has, I think, made me a better comedian.
 - I’ve been doing theaters like the Warner for about a year and we’ve found the earlier you get the tickets on sale the better idea you get on how many shows we will be doing.

 - Yeah, I am a character actor.
 - Most single guys I know think fatherhood is terrifying.
 - My favorite vegetable is the marshmallow.
 - Don’t take this the wrong way but I care more and I’m a better online friend than you. I also spend way to much time online.
 - There are a lot of good looking men on this planet. It seems like once a week someone will tell me, “I know someone who looks like you” and I don’t know what say to them except, “Tell them hi.”
 - I always want my standup act to appeal to everybody in the room, and when I started standup, and I would see people talk about their kids and their wife, and I’d always cringe a little bit, like, ‘I can’t get a date, I don’t know what you’re talking about.’
 - I usually don’t have a burger, a brat, and a steak but it is 4th of July. And I need the energy if I’m gonna start blowin crap up. It’s what the founding fathers would want.
 - The hardest part of the day is all the stuff after I open my eyes in the morning.
 - I think when my mother died, it was such a – you know, a shock to the logic that I had been raised with.
 - Deep frying a Twinkie makes it healthy, right?
 - The idea of being a practicing Catholic, it’s – for me, it’s like – I need a lot of practice, you know what I mean?
 - It’s so obvious The Weather Channel is pro hurricane. Fair and balanced my ass.
 - I don’t know what’s more exhausting about parenting: the getting up early, or acting like you know what you’re doing.
 - That’s why when I send a postcard I quiz people. “Hey, did you get that postcard?” “Yeah, yeah yeah.” “Well what’d I say?” “Uh, you were havin-” “I was in jail”
 - Babies should be classified as an antidepressant. It’s pretty hard to be in a bad mood around a 5-month-old baby.
 - I like that in my audiences, there’s a lesbian couple sitting next to a Mormon family.
 - I do want everyone to feel comfortable. That’s why I’d like to talk to you about Jesus.
 - I spend way too much time on Facebook and MySpace to feel too uncomfortable at this. I like to think of the Internet as an effective way to waste time and time.
 - I would say some of the food I talk about that I really enjoy, like cake and bacon, I eat a lot less than I portray in my act. But that stuff that I dislike, it’s pretty sincere.
 - Faith is something that’s – it’s hard to articulate. It’s – there’s – it’s not based on logic.
 - I never have free time, I don’t know about you. You ever go to the cash machine, there’s two people in line in front of you and you get kinda flustered, you’re like “Forget it! I’m not standing here for 40 seconds. I got things to do, okay?”
 - I grew up in a Catholic family in the Midwest. And I knew people of different faiths and people that were atheists and people that were agnostic.
 - Holidays are also an opportunity for kids to unlearn every good habit they’ve learned during the rest of the year. They don’t go to school. They get to stay up past their bedtime. They get candy and presents for doing nothing. Childhood utopia.
 - That’s my private business. Besides, the perception is that people that believe in God are stupid.
 - I just want to be known as funny.
 - I don’t want people to think I believe in God.
 - I’m a guy who comes from a small town in the Midwest. It’s not in my nature to say the most explicit things in public.
 - There has been this belief among the Catholic community – and this – I’m no expert, this is my opinion – that cafeteria Catholics are wrong.
 - There are some people who know who I am but there are a lot of people that have no idea who I am – which is not to say that that’s a bad thing.
 - Oh. What if we eat a lot with people that annoy the hell out of us?
 - I realize I look very hip hop but I’m really more emo with a definite Brazilian flavor.
 - I am a guy who talks about bacon and escalators.
 - I left the Midwest thinking I didn’t fit in. But when I got to New York, I realized how truly Midwestern I was.
 - People get burned out in big families, you can even see it in the naming of children. Like the first kid, “You were named after Grandma.” The seventh kid, “You were named after a sandwich I had. Now get your brother, Reuben.”
 - The entertainment business is such a strange, crazy perception business that you’re either given way too much respect, like people saying, “You should be the head of the sitcom!” Or you’re given no respect, where they’re like, “You should audition to be the garbage man that lives four houses down.”
 - My wife and I, we work together. And we wrote this book, “Dad Is Fat.” And in the book, I was encouraged constantly by my editor to be more personal and talk about more personal experiences.
 - I think when I started doing stand-up, that’s when I really tried to question everything in my belief system which is – I think a pretty important part of being a comedian is really questioning things.
 - I would make sweet love to Don Rickles.
 - I don’t have any delusions. I’m not a novelist – I’m a comedian who writes. I love doing the stand-up and the touring and the albums and all that, but it’s pretty amazing to go into a library and see your book there.
 - I’m an eccentric, silly, observational guy, but I’m not gonna frighten off social conservatives.
 - I am a guy who talks about bacon and escalators. Stand-up comedy is very much a conversation. It’s very personal, stylistically.
 - I’d have to say Sunset Salsa. Nothing against Honey Lime, but it’s for losers.
 - Most of my material is, it doesn’t necessarily involve a lot of editing. So even the show with the World Meeting of Families in Philadelphia, I don’t have to worry about some of the material being inappropriate.
 - Why do you have to be out of town to write a postcard? I want a to write a postcard to my neighbor: “I still live near you!” The guy sees me go into my apartment, flips the card over, it’s just a picture of me holding a rifle.
 - I am somebody who – my path to my faith is very kind of individual, and I don’t want to be lumped into the category of those Westboro Baptists.
 - I never went to church when I was in college, either.
 - The whole idea of celebrity is flattering – it helps you get into restaurants and stuff – but once you obtain some creative fulfillment, which you do on a nightly basis as a comedian, it’s hard to give that up just to be the wacky neighbor on a show.
 - I’m much more interested in making people laugh than getting applause breaks.
 - Anyone know if the shuttles to Hell will have Wifi? Asking for a friend.
 - I got married. My wife changed her name. I know some women have a problem with that. But I wanted her to have my old girlfriend’s name. So call me old-fashioned, but this fella does what the Bible tells.
 - I’m closer to Bob Newhart than Rodney Dangerfield.
 - People need to write articles and they need to have angles in them and I’m grateful when people are doing articles, but I always say there’s not a great mystery to stand-up comedy.
 - Television’s very much a writer’s medium, as it probably should be, but if you’re not the writer, then as the performer, you defer to that. It’s just kind of how it’s constructed. Is there some leeway? Yeah. But I also don’t want to come across as a jerk.
 - Failing and laughing at your own shortcomings are the hallmarks of a sane parent.
 - You can never find the right bowling ball. This one’s too heavy. This one’s good but its pink!

 - In Indiana, I wasn’t anything special. But in New York, I’ve gone out with girls with purple hair who go out with me because I’m exotic!
 - I don’t want to pick a team. I want to make people laugh and hopefully bring some – be humorous about the human experience, you know, whether they’re people of any stripes of life.
 - I know that Colbert could quote Thomas Aquinas and all this, but I’m somebody who, because it’s a necessity for me on a personal basis. I need it because I’m a lunatic.
 - You could say that to the pope. I want to talk to you about Jesus. He’d be like, easy, freak.
 - I would say that now I’m somebody who goes to church.
 - How did we get to the point where we’re paying for bottled water? That must have been some weird marketing meeting over in France. Some French guy’s sitting there, like, “How dumb do I think the Americans are? I bet you we could sell those idiots water.”
 - I don’t know, I find that honestly, the stand-up thing in some ways is a little bit of a cliche to carry around, because people don’t consider stand-ups really actors.
 - I spent most of my adult life essentially agnostic or an atheist.
 - I smoke crack. I get all my dancers together and we do a prayer.
 - I should clarify that anyone that goes onstage and makes strangers laugh is insane. So I am insane.
 - As I go on in standup, I keep being described as cleaner and cleaner as I do each hour, they’re like, ‘It’s unbelievable how clean,’ ‘He’s the cleanest person in the world.’ And then I’ll do shows and people will be like, ‘You’re supposed to be so clean, but you’re talking about cancer.’
 - I’m there to make people laugh. I’m not trying to come across as sexy.
 - My faith kind of keeps me in touch with the idea that I’m not in control of things.
 - Hey, people who travel with their bed pillow. You look insane.
 - I kinda expected to turn the bottle and see a recipe. “So that’s how you make ice cubes. Apparently you just freeze this stuff. Oh, but you need a tray. That’s how they trick you into it.”
 - I lived across from a Catholic church for 15 years that I never went into. And then I got married to my wife and – you know, and now we’re going in there every other day baptizing a kid.
 - I’ve always wanted to be an actor. I’ve never planned on the acting and the stand-up feeding each other; they’ve always been separate desires.
 - Cancer is always funny.
 - I believe that comedians do what they do, and then they get credit or criticism for doing it. There’s nothing planned about this.
 - I don’t want to be a TV star for the sake of being on TV. I want to have a TV show that’s based around my comedy.
 - My wife always asks me why I don’t make the bed. And I respond with the same reason why I don’t tie my shoes after I take them off.
 - Oh great, socks. You know I’m dying for your sins right? Yeah, but thanks for the socks! They’ll go great with my sandals. What am I, German?
 - I initially signed up for Twitter just to do jokes I wasn’t going to do in my stand-up routine.
 - You know, I want to teach, but I don’t want to read?
 - I was watching the Animal Planet. Did you know that the male seahorse has the baby? Why don’t they just call that one the female?
 - It’s like in most parts of America, where there was industry and there is no longer; there is cynicism mixed with sarcasm and some optimism. That’s how my background influenced my comedy.
 - I always had this romantic notion of living in New York. I just felt like, everyone could be different and weird and whatever they are in New York.
 - I do Sierra Mist commercials not because they pay me a lot of money or because it only takes a couple of days. I do it because I have a respect for all sodas and I like to communicate that. Some people say soda, some people say pop, where I’m from in Indiana they called it breakfast.
 - Comedy is a very lucrative business now, but when everyone first went into it, it didn’t make sense from a financial standpoint.
 - If someone picks up one thing you’ve written, you want them to go, ‘Wow, this is pretty good.’
 - Don’t you think it’s strange how many referees work at Footlocker?
 - Playing frisbee with a five year old is amazingly similar to chasing after a frisbee.
 - I’m a comedian, which is the opposite of a lifestyle that equips you to be a parent.
 - When people look and decide they have nothing in common with me – I’m 43, balding, blond, whatever – there’s something absolutely invigorating about winning them over. Even if it’s eight people from Sweden who don’t understand what I’m talking about.
 - I’m a big eater. I mean, a lot of my stand-up is about food, and you write about what you know, and that’s the only thing I know. I don’t know anything else.
 - It’s kind of hard to articulate, but, like, this notion of mercy, forgiveness, was very appealing for me. It was very profound. And it had a deep impact, and I think it still does.
 - Cookies at both of them. The cookies are probably better at Letterman though.
 - I think I have a lot of voices in my head and I guess my inner critic is a female.
 - I don’t think comedians make an active decision to be a certain “persona.” Comedians write the way they’re going to write.
 - That’s not to say that I’m a well-informed Catholic. I’m still in idiot.
 - Whenever I’m out of town for at least a week, I feel like I should write a postcard or something, but you can be a genius, you try and write a postcard you come across like a moron anyway: ‘This city’s got big buildings. I like food. Bye.’
