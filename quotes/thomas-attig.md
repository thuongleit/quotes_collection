 - Grieving is a journey that teaches us how to love in a new way now that our loved one is no longer with us. Consciously remembering those who have died is the key that opens the hearts, that allows us to love them in new ways.
 - The heart of grief, its most difficult challenge, is not “letting go” of those who have died but instead making the transition from loving in presence to loving in separation.
 - Grieving is a matter of relearning how to be in the world.
