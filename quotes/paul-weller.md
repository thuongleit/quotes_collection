 - I don’t feel old or young, I just am.
 - I’m always looking forward to what I’m doing now, and what’s ahead.
 - You have to keep challenging yourself. I’ve always tried to do that, and I’m not saying I’ve always been successful. Maybe I’ve rewritten the same song; it’s inevitable, but I’ve always been mindful of taking the writing somewhere else. You can’t stick in your little comfort zone.
 - You can listen to music at any moment in the day or night. Which is great, but I think it kind of devalues it as well.

 - There’s more to distract people, isn’t there? When I was a kid there was music and football and clothes. And that was kind of it, really. Those three things defined you as a person.
 - I never get too many problems. You can never please everyone anyway, obviously. And some people take the easy route and just play the greatest hits, and their audience is happy to hear that as well, and that’s fine, but it wouldn’t please me. But it doesn’t trouble me.
 - I think you have to satisfy yourself first and foremost.
 - The Jam were a good band, however I feel that the Style Council were better. A lot of people I know will disagree with me. Some things we did with The Style Council were misinterpreted or over their heads.
 - Life is a drink and you get drunk when you’re young.
 - I could say that ‘Exile On Main Street’ was my favourite or whatever, but I’m more about the songs and the artists and the sound that they bring.
 - No man should have cowboys boots in his wardrobe. That’s fair enough, isn’t it? Unless you’re a cowboy, of course.

 - I think politicians are so far out of step with what people really want.
 - Everyone gets frustrated and aggressive, and I’d sooner take my aggression out on a guitar than on a person.
 - There’s such a wealth of great music, clothes or whatever. There is so much great stuff out there, that why would you not still be interested if you’ve grown up in that kind of culture?
 - People say you make your best work when in despair, but I think happiness is a good place to write from.
 - I saw an interview with Keith Richards. He said, ‘How else could a kid in Dartford suddenly connect with and understand what Muddy Waters is singing?’ There’s a cultural difference, but there’s just something in that music that subconsciously or internally you just understand; it just makes sense.
 - I wear jeans and a T-shirt sometimes. I just like clothes – since the first time I can remember, like age ten or eleven; I was just obsessed with music and clothes. Just like a lot of people in England from my generation.

 - I could write songs about politics, but I’m conscious of not writing songs that sound the same as the ones I wrote 30 years ago.
 - I’m fine with being thought of as a guitar player, and if I can get any recognition or respect for doing that, that’s a pretty good thing for me.
 - I don’t like the royal family, I don’t like the establishment, I don’t like the civil service.
 - When I’m dead, I wanna leave a body of work, like authors or great painters do.
 - I’m not big on rap, to be honest. I just don’t get it. It’s angry people shouting. I like a song, melodies, people singing.
 - I have to do what I’m doing at the time. That’s the most important thing. You might lose some people along the way, and you might gain other people on the way, that’s just the way it is. But nevertheless, if you’re driven by something, there is no argument about it; that’s what you have to do.
 - I think anybody goes through a crisis of confidence from time to time. You have to kind of doubt yourself, sometimes. It’s the way forward.

 - I love soul music, that’s my real love in life and in whatever shape or form it is.
 - I had a total belief in The Style Council. I meant every word and felt every action.
 - The whole nostalgia thing, and just sticking with what you always liked and what you know and not taking a chance on something or expanding. I think especially after a certain age.
 - I think people are just really disappointed, disappointed with Blair as well, who’s just like Bush’s lapdog. I think everyone’s just disillusioned with politics in our country, and it must be the same in your country.
 - I’m very, very open to experimenting with different people and trying to find different methods of writing and making music.
 - It’s always good to play New York. The Apollo is a great gig. I loved that.

 - There’s this British elegance that we, at times, have really missed in the States. We’ve always been more of a sportswear culture.
 - The way that house music has become so white and so sanitized over the decades and the fact it’s still going on, well I think it’s sad really, but at the time I really loved it. I loved all the black house music that was coming out of Chicago and New Jersey, which I just thought was really soulful.

 - I think the biggest influence for me is when I hear a great piece of music, whatever the style, I’m kind of inspired by that greatness and I’m inspired to try and obtain something that comes close to that greatness.
 - When I listen to a record, or when I’m making a record, I listen to everything. I listen to the drums, the bass, the voice, the arrangement. I listen to the whole piece as an ensemble.
 - If you’re in music, you’re in music, and if you’re in music you just want to keep making records and playing. That’s what it’s about, isn’t it? At least, that’s what I always thought it was about, anyway.
 - It’s important to know all those things, but part of our jobs is to move people along and to make people excited to buy music or buy clothes, and give them enjoyment, I think, too.

 - In all honesty, I don’t know what one song can change.
 - When you look at so much of what we all love, there’s either soul-based to it, or it’s the blues. It’s really the beginnings of any kind of music. It really is; it all starts there. Because after that, it’s music of the moment.
 - In my old age, my mind gets more open, and I listen to so many different types of music and I guess that all reflects in my work.
 - I’ve always liked my clothes, even before I could properly afford them. Clothes for me were never a cloak, a cover. They were how I chose to express myself.
 - It’s just something internal that says, ‘I’ve got to do this now. This is what I’m doing now.’
 - I was always taught as a kid that if there’s anything you want in life, you’ve got to work towards it. I guess that sort of stayed with me, really.
 - The first thing I bought that was really stylish was in 1969 when I was eleven. I saved up for a black, grey and white tie-dye grandad vest. It was too big – they weren’t catering for kids my age – and hung off me, but I loved it.

 - I still love playing music. It was all I ever wanted to do, and I got the chance to do it.

 - It can get boring. Not the playing the songs necessarily, or doing the clothes. You know, you need stimulus.

 - If you’re into a certain band, you’re into the way they dress.
