 - It’s true that bluegrass is a virtuosic form and asks that of its performer. Old-time music is older rawer and purer. It’s less stylized. We don’t solo. Well sometimes we do, but it’s different it has more to do with rock-and-roll than bluegrass does.
 - Country music is the combination of African and European folk songs coming together and doing a little waltz right here in the American south. They came together at some cotillion, and somebody snuck a black person into the room, and he danced with a white lady, and music was born.
 - I heard Pete Seeger records when I was a kid. I saw Bob Dylan when I was about 12. The first song I ever learned to play was a song by Phil Ochs.
 - I guess it’s a bit like not claiming your brother at school. This kind of disowning of the thing that you’re most like. You want to be something cool, like Michael Jackson say, with a boom box over your shoulder and wearing leather. But you know deep down you’re just a hayseed.
 - I didn’t grow up on the porch of a cabin looking out over the 90 acres that the mule was plowing with Paw-Paw playing the banjo. But I was always interested in folk music.
 - We weren’t straight-A students. We didn’t start playing until we were teenagers, and we started playing rock and roll and punk rock – power chords – before we ever thought we would play folk music. So virtuosity was just never in my reach.
 - I think country music is a champion of women. That stuff coming out of Nashville now wants to see a woman looking good in the kitchen whipping up some biscuits.
 - Y’all drinking whiskey is probably a gregarious act. When you’re not an alcoholic it’s pretty fun to drink whiskey. But when you are it’s a very solo ritual. It’s not gregarious at all. But vice has always informed country music and all music.
 - Sometimes our significant others travel with us.
 - It seems like everyone’s listening to fiddles and banjos.
 - Because music gets you high, so it makes sense to sing about what else gets you high.
 - I think it is good for people who are incarcerated or who are bound up one way or the other-people like Lily Kimball and all the prostitues of Memphis. This gal, she needs some wings, and a good song can make that happen.
 - It’s not very long ago that we were all singing country music. And country music is equally black as it is white and that’s important to recognize.
 - Like anybody else of my era, I listened to a whole lot of Michael Jackson. I guess I was probably inspired by the way he danced, and the way he sang, and his image.
