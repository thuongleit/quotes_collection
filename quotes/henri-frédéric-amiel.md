 - Dreams are excursions into the limbo of things, a semi-deliverance from the human prison.
 - Happiness has no limits, because God has neither bottom nor bounds, and because happiness is nothing but the conquest of God through love.

 - What we do not understand we have no right to judge.
 - What governs men is the fear of truth.
