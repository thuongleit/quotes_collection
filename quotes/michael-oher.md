 - Don’t ever allow yourself to feel trapped by your choices. Take a look at yourself. You are a unique person created for a specific purpose. Your gifts matter. Your story matters. Your dreams matter. You matter.
 - You should hope for courage and try for honor. And maybe even pray that the people telling you what to do have some, too.
 - That’s why courage is tricky. Should you always do what others tell you to do? Sometimes you might not even know why you’re doing something. I mean, any fool can have courage. But honor, that’s the real reason you either do something or you don’t. It’s who you are and maybe who you want to be.
 - It’s true that we can’t help the circumstances we’re born into and some of us start out in a much tougher place than other people. But just because we started there doesn’t mean we have to end there.
 - Courage is a hard thing to figure. You can have courage based on a dumb idea or mistake but you’re not supposed to question adults or your coach or your teacher because they make the rules. Maybe they know best but maybe they don’t. It all depends on who you are, where you come from.
 - If you die trying for something important, then you have both honor and courage, and that’s pretty good.
 - If you know where your next meal is coming from, you are not poor.
 - I came so far- from nothing to a Super Bowl championship.
