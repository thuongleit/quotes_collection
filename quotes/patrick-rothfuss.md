 - The truth is that the world is full of dragons, and none of us are as powerful or cool as we’d like to be. And that sucks. But when you’re confronted with that fact, you can either crawl into a hole and quit, or you can get out there, take off your shoes, and Bilbo it up.
 - Words are pale shadows of forgotten names. As names have power, words have power. Words can light fires in the minds of men. Words can wring tears from the hardest hearts.

 - Metal rusts, music lasts forever.
 - Just handle the books gently and you’ll get along fine.

 - The day we fret about the future is the day we leave our childhood behind.
 - We are more than the parts that form us.
 - Music is a proud, temperamental mistress. Give her the time and attention she deserves, and she is yours. Slight her and there will come a day when you call and she will not answer. So I began sleeping less to give her the time she needed.
 - When the hearthfire turns to blue, what to do? what to do? run outside, run and hide when his eyes are black as crow? where to go? where to go? near and far. Here they are. see a man without a face? move like ghosts from place to place. whats their plan? whats their plan? Chandrian. Chandrian.
 - But how awful would that be? How terrible to live surrounded by the stark, sharp, hollowness of things that simply were enough?
 - Remember this, son, if you forget everything else. A poet is a musician who can’t sing. Words have to find a man’s mind before they can touch his heart, and some men’s minds are woeful small targets. Music touches their hearts directly no matter how small or stubborn the mind of the man who listens.
 - A tree doesn’t make a thunderstorm, but any fool knows where lightning’s going to strike.

 - All explicit knowledge is translated knowledge, and all translation is imperfect.
 - You do not know the first note of the music that moves me.

 - A long stretch of road will teach you more about yourself than a hundred years of quiet introspection.
 - I’ve waited a long time to show these flowers how pretty you are.
 - Don’t get me wrong, hard and soft fantasy stories can both be good. But you need to know which camp you’re in. I’m into realism. I’m a hard fantasy guy.
 - Roses! I swear you men have all your romance from the same worn book. Flowers are a good thing, a sweet thing to give a lady. But it is always roses, always red, and always perfect hothouse blooms when they can come by them.
 - It is quite a thing. There are so many men, all endlessly trying to sweep me off my feet. And there is one of you, trying just the opposite. Making sure my feet are firm beneath me lest I fall.

 - I only know one story. But oftentimes small pieces seem to be stories themselves.
 - I’ll string a fiddle with your guts and make you play it while I dance.

 - Appearance is a type of power.
 - Fencing is more a sport than a martial art. It would be like basing your knowledge of roman phalanx warfare on NFL football.

 - It was the patient, cut-flower sound of a man who is waiting to die.

 - But sometimes the best help a person can find is helping someone else.
 - In brief, worldbuilding is different than setting in my opinion. Setting is a room. A backdrop. It’s scenery. But without good worldbuilding, you can’t have realistic feeling scenery. You can’t have cool, unique backdrops for your story.
 - I’ve never really understood the desire people have to quantify a baby. “He’s X big and Y long,” As if the baby is a fish you’re not sure you’re going to keep. Or some prize potato you’re hoping will win a prize at the county fair.
 - Bones mend. Regret stays with you forever.
 - If there is one thing I will not abide it is the folly of a willful pride.

 - Music sounds different to the one who plays it. It is the musician’s curse.

 - There are few things as nauseating as pure obedience.
 - I’ve got an idea for a modern day faerie tale that I think would made a great short novel. But I just don’t have the time to work on it right now. I’m way too busy with the ‘Kingkiller Chronicles’ and being a new dad.

 - There is something powerfully beguiling about the excited eyes of a young woman. They can pull all manner of nonsense out of a foolish young man, and I was no exception to this rule.
 - I have a blog where I keep in touch with my fans. I write about things that are important to me. Sometimes on there I’ll just tell a little story about the things that happen in my everyday life. People seem to enjoy them well enough.
 - I’m not officially a collector, but I have a strange attraction and a weakness for keys and coins. Old keys and interesting coins.
 - Generally my favorite remarks always come from my readers. I’ve had people say my books made them laugh, or cry, or that it frightened them late at night.
 - The way I cook it’s more like mad science. There’s a lot of inspiration and dramatic failure with the occasional gorgeous success.
 - I can’t count the men who have tried to seduce me away from my virtue by teaching me how to defend it.
 - Humor is important. If you’re going to tell any sort of realistic story, you’re going to have to have humor in it, because people are funny. Clever people especially.
 - Is there a connection between language and magic? Yes. Ten times yes. So much yes that it almost doesn’t bear talking about. It’s as pointless that arguing that the sun is hot.
 - There is a sort of camaraderie that rarely exists except between men who have fought the same enemies and know the same women.
 - Don’t get me wrong, magic is cool. But a nervous mother singing to her child at night while something moves quietly through the dark outside her house? That’s a story. Handled properly, it’s more dramatic than any apocalypse or goblin army could ever be.
 - We need time to relax and enjoy ourselves too, no matter how dark the story. The occasional humorous moment helps with that. That’s one of the things that Joss Whedon excels at in his storytelling.
 - I don’t feel beholden to follow the real world at all. The important thing is to know WHY things turned out the way they did. You need to understand the reasons for events, or at least be able to make reasonable guesses about them.
 - It’s my opinion that if you’re trying to tell a realistic story that centers around realistic characters, you can’t help but touch on important issues. Those issues are what make us human.

 - Someone’s parents have been singing entirely the wrong sort of songs.
 - Science is just magic with better PR.
 - There is only one Whedon, and I am his prophet.

 - I’m not a speed writer. I write slowly and revise obsessively. The end result tends to be good. That’s where my strength is.
 - To be both rich and handsome was bad enough. But to have a voice like honey over warm bread on top of that was simply inexcusable.

 - It’s one thing to not want an evil-sorcerer type villain in your story, but it’s another thing to avoid having any sort of antagonist at all. A story without an antagonist gets weird pretty quick.

 - Then he turned it the third time, and the boy’s ass fell off.

 - Abenthy gave me an appraising look. I’d been waiting for it. It was the look that said, “You don’t sound as young as you look.” I hoped he’d come to grips with it fairly soon. It gets tiresome being spoken to as if you are a child, even if you happen to be one.
 - Do you just want to get by? Or do you want to make me proud?
 - I do this so you cannot help but hear. A wise man views a moonless night with fear.

 - Everything said, you couldn’t hope for a nicer day to have a half dozen ex-soldiers with hunting bows relieve you of everything you owned.

 - I loved college. I wish I was still taking classes instead of teaching them.
 - You can have an interesting story about a person living an interesting life. And if it’s done well, that is just as engaging as the end of the world. A million people dying – we can’t process. One person, we can process.

 - By your logic I should also be in charge of Solinade dances, needlework, and horse thieving.
 - In my opinion there are two basic questions that any writer tries to answer. “What is?” is the question non-fiction asks. “What if?” is the question fiction asks. That’s the question I’m more interested in.
 - When someone tells you a piece of their life, they’re giving you a gift, not granting you your due.
 - It’s my belief that you should never show your work to anyone in the publishing world until it shines like a diamond. Rough drafts don’t shine, as a rule. Mine certainly didn’t. That’s why I was rejected for years and years.
