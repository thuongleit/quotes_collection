 - I’m thankful for weird people out there ’cause they’re some of the most creative people.
 - I’m not a fighter. I’m not a tough guy at all. I walk away from fights.

 - Life is too short to miss out on the beautiful things like a double cheeseburger.
 - Someday you’ll miss her like she missed you. Someday you’ll need her like she needed you. Someday you’ll love her and she won’t love you.
 - I think, even a lot of people that make movies forget is that, in my mind, a movie should work with the sound off. You should be able to watch a movie without the sound and understand what’s going on. That’s your job, to build a series of chronological images that tell the story.
 - Everyone always talks about the speed of New York, and I still walk slow around New York, and everyone is walking faster than me all the time, and I notice it every time we go out.
 - Whatever the fighting is – boxing, fighting, Judo, Thai boxing, it’s how much you know doing that. Some people just know how some people move.
 - If you’re with someone you don’t exactly trust then you have to watch yourself and that’s the hardest thing for an actor not to do, and not listen to yourself as you’re talking.
 - Sometimes a thong completely betrays you.
 - No one’s calling me for lawyer roles. I still have a lot to do to prove myself.
 - I don’t think there’s a date minimum or maximum. I don’t get the whole ‘All right, you’ve got to wait three days to call after the date.’ If I got a number from a girl, I’d call that night. There’s no science to it for me. You just do what it is that you feel like doing.
 - I had a bad stutter when I was really young. I couldn’t get a sentence out. Like, ‘D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-ad.’ And that turned into a mumble.
 - Someone who doesn’t take herself too seriously and can be a goofball. Because everyone’s a nerd inside, I don’t care how cool you are.
 - Getting hurt and narrowly escaping death is sort of a thing for me.
 - I consider myself a decent athlete but when I started to train martial arts like Kung Fu, I realised it had nothing to do with how athletic you are. It’s all mental. It’s what you know, how you use it and your mental toughness and composure. It’s incredible.
 - I had people in my life who were insane and negative, but they taught me how not to be, how I didn’t want to end up.
 - I grew up watching ‘Braveheart’ and ‘Gladiator.’ Those are my ‘Star Wars.’ They have values and traits about them that I wish I had.

 - I can sit underneath the shed with all my family, my cousins, and everything, and just be like, “Yeah, this is what it’s about – just sitting with people you love and hanging out.”
 - I learned to appreciate repetition. That’s why I can dance. It’s how I learned to act. I have a high tolerance for repetition.
 - I write, but I don’t write poetry. I don’t rhyme or anything like that.
 - I worry about Bieber, man. That kid’s wildly talented. I hope he doesn’t fall down into the usual ways of young kids because it’s so hard for someone to be responsible when they’re not asked to be.
 - Waxing was an interesting experience. Not quite as painful as I expected.
 - Truthfully, this is how I approach my workout: I want to be the best athlete I can possibly be. If I can out-perform some of the better athletes then I’m happy. When I look at the NFL or the NBA, these guys look how I want to look – it’s useable, functional muscle.
 - I see caring for somebody as a creative outlet. I like drawing little faces and writing little stories and hiding them in places. I don’t think it’s that hard to be thoughtful, especially when you do care about the person.
 - Comedy doesn’t come easy for me. I’ve only done 2 movies that are really comedy-style films and I have to work at them. And they’re just as scary in a way. I hate labeling all these things; comedy, love stories, dark drama, whatever.
 - If my Dad doesn’t like you, you will know. My Mom is just too innocent to ever lie. She doesn’t even cuss.
 - The film is a direct mirror of the director. If your director doesn’t know how to dress, there will be an aesthetic of the film that won’t come through – whether it’s in the costumes if he doesn’t know exactly what he wants or the look of the film.
 - I’ve cried a hundred times at The Notebook. My wife cries and that makes me cry, and she makes me promise we’re going to die in bed together. I’m like: “That’s weird, I don’t want to talk about that.”
 - I’m not a political person. When I start to get into it, it just upsets me. I feel so powerless when it comes to politics. So I’ve just decided to be non-political and very, very pro-soldier.
 - But I’m not a tough guy or a street fighter for real. I’m just an actor.
 - Fighting for men back then, I think, was just more a way of life, especially if you were a soldier obviously.
 - For a time, it would work well. then it worked less and my pain was more. I would go through wild bouts of depression, horrible comedowns. I understand why kids kill themselves. I absolutely do. You feel terrible. You feel soul-less. “I’ll never do it to my child”.
 - You can’t fake wrestling. We can fake punch, but with wrestling you just have to go ahead and do it. You really need to see the hand hit the face, the head butting and everything.
 - I’ve never been sent a lock of hair or anything like that, but I’ve gotten underwear with my face on it. That was weird.
 - My parents couldn’t handle my energy so they enrolled me in every sport the school was offering. I didn’t resent it because I loved sports and picked them up easily.
 - I don’t know if I’ve ever written anything that’s not a bill! I do write stories but I don’t put a stamp on them. I wrote a story for my wife over Christmas and gave it to her as a present because she asked me to, but I don’t put a stamp on things and send them to people.
 - If you look at any of the greats, from people like Paul Newman and Robert Redford to, you know, Brad Pitt – to get any of the kinds of roles like the ones that they’ve gotten, or just to be a part of any of the kinds of movies they’ve made, would be the end-all for me.
 - I did kung fu from when I was nine to 13. You have to be really careful but you want to be able to make it look eventually as though it’s just a part of you. So, you train over and over and over again.
 - You don’t try any less hard on the ones that don’t. I’ve gotten lucky to work with some amazingly talented people that have helped the ones that have worked work. I think you just have to keep doing the stories you love and the characters that you love and are drawn to.
 - I still want to write Clint Eastwood a letter saying, ‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry for all us wimp actors. You’re the truth.’ I guarantee he’s not the person you want to fight, even now! You look at him, and you don’t want to mess with him. He would still take you down.
 - I have the flying dream a lot where I’m jumping off a building and just flying around.
 - I’m not political. I just want America to do well, I want the world to do well. I want everyone to stop fighting.
 - I love the supporting characters because you get to do more, to be totally honest. It’s been sort of a theme with me. In Son of No One, I think I might have seven lines in the entire movie because everything is happening to my character.
 - I don’t know if I’m very complicated at all. I wish I was. I wish I was one of these deep, intricate people. But I just love having fun really.
 - I think the best thing to try to do is allow your daughter or your son to know that they can come to you for anything. If you can break down that wall so they don’t feel embarrassed by telling you things, that’s half the battle.
 - There are so many things I want to do. Like, I want to get an artist, a musician, a photographer, and a bunch of dancers that I know and just travel across Africa and just film it and just see what happens. Do and learn as much as I possibly can. Luckily, I have a lot more time.
 - A well arranged scrapbook, filled with choice selections, is a most excellent companion for anyone who has the least literary taste.
 - I was not good in school. I could never read very fast or very well. I got tested for learning disabilities, for dyslexia. Then I got put on Ritalin and Dexedrine. I took those starting in the eighth grade. As soon as they pumped that drug into me, it would focus me right in.

 - I’ve always had way too much energy so I’m always looking for new things to do to channel that energy.
 - I do get nervous to act, it kind of depends on what it is really.
 - Playing a character that allows me to play around with some of the feelings I have inside of myself and explore them – and maybe put them to rest a little bit, or at least come to terms with them – feels successful to me. I think it’s about believing in what you do.
 - Daniel Day-Lewis and Sean Penn to me are the two best actors of all time. I’m just glad to have the pleasure to be in an era that they’re acting while I’m acting. They’re probably the best actors in my mind.
 - Any teen gets into a little trouble here and there. It’s not hard to find trouble when you’re looking for it as a kid.
 - I think the action movies in the 80s and 90s were different. It was a testosterone age. Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Sylvester Stallone – they fuelled my childhood. But now I don’t think I’d like to do just action, I don’t enjoy that.

 - I would like magical palm tree that had a lot of shade with instead of coconuts there’s just peanut butter jelly sandwiches with cheetos underneath. And my wife that is always happy and possibly naked.

 - I went hunting, I shot a deer, and it mortified me. I just couldn’t do it again.
 - I want a career and the thing is you really have to love acting. I didn’t just fall into it and it wasn’t just something I was good at. I’ve had to really work at this. I’ve had to fall on my face time and time again. You get ‘no’ 99 per cent of the time and a ‘yes’ just once.
 - American audiences love period pieces. America doesn’t have a lot of old things. It’s a new country so I think we’re a little bit fascinated by that.
 - I know I will never wear sandals now anywhere. I got in a fight in the back of a grocery store when I was really young, like 14 or something. And I remember my feet were so torn up afterwards because I lost my sandals in the middle of the fight. My toenail was missing. It just sucked.

 - But I stuttered as a kid. I went to classes to help it, and it just went away around fourth grade, when I became more aware of how others spoke, I think. But also, growing up in the South, a mumble is a way of speaking.
 - I like smaller films better. I don’t know why. I think it’s the intimacy and there’s not this avalanche. It is an avalanche, but it’s really myopic. It’s really small.
 - There’s a dance that happens with you and that’s why I really like doing it with stunt men, because they know how to dance generally better than actors do. It is choreography and if you aren’t used to doing it things can go wrong.

 - The director sets the tone, and if someone’s ruling it with an iron fist, people are quiet and the days go long in my experience, when there’s a very serious tone, the days just drag. When there’s someone who, in between takes, is joking or laughing the days go quick.
