 - Bacon is like a good pair of Levi’s-it never goes out of style.
 - I’m lucky that my restaurant partners are my wife Liz and Doug Petkovic. We opened our first restaurant over 15 years ago. And we didn’t open up our second restaurant for almost ten years. So that gave us a good foundation of employees.
 - Eating chicken without skin is like riding a bike without wheels.
 - Go to the grocery store and buy better things. Buy quality, buy organic, buy natural, go to the farmers market. Immediately that’s going to increase the quality of the food you make.

 - The exposure from ‘Iron Chef’ has been helpful, but at the end of the day your product and your service determine whether you get customers or not. If people decide to eat out less during a recession, the first restaurants that they will cut out are the ones that don’t do a great job.
 - It’s not always possible to sit down and eat at home in this day and age of fast-paced living, but if you are going to eat out, do so as a family and support all the great local places in your areas. I’ll still eat at the same diner I did as a kid with my parents.
 - When I met my wife 20 plus years ago, she was a vegetarian, so I was the closest thing to the devil that she had ever met.

 - People come up to me all the time and say, ‘Oh, I love to watch Food Network,’ and I ask them what they cook, and they say, ‘I don’t really cook.’ They’re afraid, they’re intimidated, they know all about food from eating out and watching TV, but they don’t know where to start in their own kitchen.

 - I’m a firm believer that all this packaged stuff that Americans are buying up in gobs is making them fatter.

 - With all the hybrid stuff and things like that, I think that’s a fabulous direction to go with cars in that sense. As someone who grew up around muscle cars, I’ll never not be able to not love a muscle car. Not that I don’t care about the environment, that’s not it. But I adore muscle cars.
 - I make no bones about it. I have no understanding of pastry.
