 - My stories are very compact. I want them to say the most complex things in the simplest way.

 - Often in writing programs, articulation and clarity are more important than what you actually say.
 - During the war, there were people wishing me death, wishing my son death, wishing my wife death in very graphic ways. In the past, I would go overseas and I would say, “Israel is like my family: we disagree, but we’re all brothers.” I can’t say that anymore, because life proves me wrong.
