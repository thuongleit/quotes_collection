 - I’m a fighter through and through. I don’t give up. I have a strong heart and I will push until there’s nothing left in me.
 - You have to grow. If not you’re then living in regret and you’re living in the past and you’re not progressing forward. And I learned the mistakes that I made and they made me stronger.
