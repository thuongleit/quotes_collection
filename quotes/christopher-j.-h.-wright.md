 - It is not so much the case that God has a mission for his church in the world, as that God has a church for his mission in the world. Mission was not made for the church; the church was made for mission – God’s mission.
 - Mission means inviting all the peoples of the earth to hear the music of God’s future and dance to it today.
 - The church was made for mission-God’s mission.
 - Only the gospel exposes the cancer of idolatry.
