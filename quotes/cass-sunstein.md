 - Once we know that people are human and have some Homer Simpson in them, then there’s a lot that can be done to manipulate them.
 - I think it may be that the fans of your least-favorite political candidate, whoever it is, are much more likable and light-side types than you might think going in. One way to reach them is to talk about Star Wars.
 - It is even possible that desirable redistribution is more likely to occur through climate change policy than otherwise, or to be accomplished more effectively through climate policy than through direct foreign aid.
 - It’s very common to say that Star Wars in the late ’70s, that was kind of perfect for Cold War culture and the aftermath of Vietnam in the ’60s to have an upbeat, hopeful, cartoonish tale of a hero’s journey. I think those explanations are easy to offer and almost always wrong.
 - Sunstein said government agents ‘might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action,’
 - Presumed consent preserves freedom of choice, but it is different from explicit consent because it shifts the default rule. Under this policy, all citizens would be presumed to be consenting donors, but they would have the opportunity to register their unwillingness to donate.
 - I love The Matrix, especially the first one.
 - Most problems are best solved privately, not through government. There’s a problem of discourtesy in the world, which is best handled through social norms, which are indispensable. But you wouldn’t want the government to be mandating courtesy.
 - I dealt with people with diverse political views. If you find people who are your political opponents, and talk to them for an hour, chances are you’re going to like them, and they’re not full of hate.
 - I’ll tell you an explanation that I find commonly overrated and speculative in the extreme: the idea that things that succeed in popular culture do that because they hit the temper of the times.
 - I am proud to say that the Federalist Society was founded in part at the University of Chicago, and one of its best characteristics has been an attack on liberal shibboleths by looking at real consequences and specific problems and by asking what law actually does.
 - If Star Wars had been released in the late ’60s, or late ’80s, or late ’90s, adjusting for technology, it fits spectacularly well.
 - We might have new issues involving information technology for example, or new questions arising out of the war on terror, or new issues arising from natural disasters that can’t be anticipated.
 - There is no proportional representation requirement in the Equal Protection Clause.
 - Those who believe in climate change, as I do, I think it’s also fair to say that they are more receptive to confirming evidence than disconfirming evidence. They happen to be right, but their motivations are in play also.
 - We ought to ban hunting, I suggest, if there isn’t a purpose other than sport and fun. That should be against the law. It’s time now.

 - The idea that Taylor Swift would become the giant pop icon of 2015, 2016 – she’s really good, but I don’t think it’s written in the stars.
 - The middle class is not doing well, and trade policy might have something to do with that, and so someone who is going to be fixated on those things, who has a business background, has some appeal.
 - How do things, whether they are movies, or plays, Hamilton, or people, ideas – how do they become transformative or iconic? That is in some ways what the actual Star Wars saga gets at, with the tale of the rise and the fall of the empire and the rise and the fall of Republics.
 - I’m interested in how the Internet spreads information.
 - Almost all gun control legislation is constitutionally fine. And if the court is right, then fundamentalism does not justify the view that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to bear arms.
 - If you have a regulation that’s going to save hundreds of thousands of lives annually and not cost very much, that sounds like a very good idea.
 - This is a very, very conservative judge who in his dissenting opinions is overwhelmingly likely to be more conservative than the majority.

 - It’s deeply human to do both the worst things and the best things because of your fear of loss.
 - I have argued in favor of a reformulation of First Amendment law. The overriding goal of the reformulation is to reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.
 - Probably, if we looked at Da Vinci or Michelangelo with care, we’d see a historical particularity that the work is not treated as having. It’s certainly true of Shakespeare.
 - Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law.
 - Catholicism is a wide tent in terms of political and legal positions. We could have nine Catholics on the Supreme Court and a great deal of diversity toward the law.

 - My own view is that institutions are a glory, and for all their imperfections, something really to be proud of. It is true that things can be a lot better than they are. It’s okay to emphasize that.
 - I got into the genesis of Star Wars, and the tale seemed to me endlessly fascinating.
 - Liberals are sometimes defined as people who can’t take their own side in an argument.
 - The fear of loss is an engine of horrors, but also a source of the greatest forms of heroism. There’s not a lot of art that puts that in bold letters. It’s psychologically very interesting and acute, I think. That’s not the central reading, I think, of the New Testament.
 - The ‘cash for clunkers’ program was a big success in part because it gave people the sense that the economy was moving.
