 - Life is a series of choices that are made in the present moment.
 - Meditation is a time to focus, train the mind, and bring it to stillness. It is not a time to rest and relax.
 - Try to let go of the idea that you need to do yoga perfectly in order to see its benefits. Rather, let it be a process of waking up to who you really are. If you do this, you will know joy. And that joy will be your gift to a world that very much needs our healing.
