 - I love Coldplay. I love Steely Dan – Steely Dan’s probably one of my top three bands of all time.

 - I’m always begging people like James Brooks and Cameron Crowe to come to screenings, to see what they make of it, and they’re always ridiculously helpful. They also keep me brave enough to commit to what I’m trying to do. They can be great cheerleaders for risk-taking.
 - Some stories feel like they need more time or less time to tell. To not obsessively have to trim or add that final two or three minutes is very helpful, because you can just organically follow how the story feels.
 - A lot of times, it’s easy to trim the movie ’cause you just start losing things that you thought would be there just for amusement’s sake that actually are not funny. My favorite part of the process is seeing it with an audience. I do about eight previews to see how things are working.
 - I’m just trying to be truthful and collaborate with people who have interesting things to say.

 - I love the Lonely Island. I wish there was more Lonely Island movies.

 - There’s nothing more fun than debating and defending your taste in music.

 - I still feel like a nerd.
 - Every time I’m in editing, there’s always a moment where you think, “Maybe this should be six or seven minutes shorter, but I’m losing character and story that I think is important.” When I like things, I’m not in a rush for them to end.
