 - My dad says he likes to bask in my glow.
 - I’m just a tool, I’m just a big, hard tool.

 - I might go to some tiny little town in Idaho with, like, three people living there.
 - I’ll probably go to London and hide.

 - Outside of my family, I don’t really know. They’re great people and my parents are great parents, and they brought me up very well, I think. I don’t know, I think that’s about all the heroes I’ve had.
 - Sometimes just when I say hello the right way, I’m like, ‘Whoa, I’m so cool.’
 - My dream job is being a pianist.
 - What worries me the most is that I don’t know when my patience will run out, when I’ll finally do something really stupid. Wait and see...
 - Someone stole my shoelaces once from my shoes. I still wear them and never put laces in them – they’re like my trademark shoes now!
 - I had pecs for about two days. Everyone would hate me. Just look at me walking around with my little peacoat on. My little customized pea coat.
 - This thing with everyone knowing you, it’s weird, because people have this one-sided relationship where they look at your picture and feel they know you more than someone they actually know. I don’t really know myself that well.
 - I always get carried away when I’m kissing. I just go nuts! Walking away after it is the strangest moment for me. It’s embarrassing – not knowing what to say to each other.
 - The link between my brain and my mouth is just not there anymore.
 - I don’t really know how accepted I am. Nothing ever matters to me apart from the people with negative opinions. That’s literally it. That always drives me on to the next thing. It’s funny, you just focus on them and then the next movie. That’s the only thing you’re thinking about when it comes out.

 - It’s funny now, trying to socialise with people. There’s this cautiousness about people which I just find really weird.
 - I was obsessed with Eminem when I was younger. When he first came out I was about 12 and fanatical about his ‘Slim Shady’ CD. I think he’s a genius.
 - The only way to establish any kind of mystique, is to completely shut up and never talk to anyone. And I’m contractually obligated not to shut up.
 - It’s been amazing to play the same character through so many adventures. And it’s so strange because my life has changed so much over these years, but ‘Twilight’ and Edward Cullen will always be a part of me. It’s been my whole life. My whole 20s. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.
 - If I had known that this movie would bring so much craziness, I don’t know if I would have said ‘yes’ to the Twilight Saga. I never asked to be a poster-boy.
 - I actually quite like working with kids and I like working with animals, which everybody says you shouldn’t do. It makes you feel like you’re not acting, as soon as you have someone who’s providing stuff to react to.

 - I learned that if a relationship is honest, it can last through anything despite all the challenges we have to face and everything that happens around us.
 - Nothing can be good if you do it for money or for fame.
 - Cosmopolis is the movie of my life. I didn’t consider myself an actor before, even if I had 10 years of acting behind me. I always felt like a fraud, and inappropriate. I doubt a lot. David Cronenberg gave me confidence in myself. He changed my way of acting and thinking in this industry.
 - I’m curious to see what happens in England because in all this madness I think I can always go home to England and it’ll all turn off.
 - Your ideas dry up sometimes, and you get lazy sometimes ’cause you’re around the same people. That was the good thing about having different directors. You had to stay on your toes.
 - Music means freedom to me. But in acting you can pretend to be someone else and I like that.
 - When something or someone is hyped and you’re put on the forefront of a lot of things, people want to tear you down. That’s kind of scary, especially when you’re not really putting yourself out there.
 - I put a flower in someone’s locker when I was 15 years old. This girl, called Maria. Maybe I was 14. She actually thought it was from someone else, and the other guy claimed it as well, which was just great.
 - Twilight fans are literally on the verge of being clinically insane.
 - I don’t find myself that interesting as a human being, so I don’t really think that much of what I say or do warrants being recorded.
 - When I was flying to Rome, we flew over London; I felt like bursting into tears. It’s part of me, so I can’t leave London behind for good.
 - It’s insane. I’ve had girls throwing themselves at me since the hype started. Now the film’s out I can’t walk down the street without being pounced on. All my life I’ve hated crowds. Now I only have to step outdoors and I’m at the centre of one. It’s very cool but it’s very uncomfortable too.
 - I thought I was supposed to have a fake six-pack in this scene.
 - The only emotional connection of relevance is with my dog. My relationship with my dog, it’s ridiculous.
 - I don’t know if I’m particularly funny, I mean one of my legs is shorter than the other one, it makes everything look very awkward, so I can just pretty much look like an idiot, but I don’t know whether I can be like witty. It could be a problem.
 - I am now determined to do really weird parts but I think I overdo it in auditions so nobody really trusts me!
 - It’s awkward doing it with anybody, but it’s like Twister.
 - I’d love to have a family – sometime in the future.
 - There are too many possibilities, if you can’t die. If you’re playing a normal human being, there’s always that.
 - I have been called Taylor Lautner a few time which I’m quite happy about. You only have to look at us to see how funny that is but it’s nice to pretend I might be hiding a Taylor six-pack under my shirt.
 - My worst habit is speaking to much.
 - I never really considered myself attractive, really. I was always kind of gangly in school.
 - I can’t see any advantage to fame. I’m happy with the life I have now. I’ve got the same two friends I’ve had since I was 12, and I can’t see that changing.
 - The most embarassing is when friends ask you to meet up with them and you have to tell them “Sorry I can’t go to that place” because you’re fully aware photographers will be waiting for you there. I feel like such a weasle when things like that happen, like the world has to revolve around me.
 - My dad said to me the other day, I really am an artistic person. I was shocked as I never saw him as a creative. I think me and my sisters are living out that side of him as my sister is another creative person, she’s a songwriter.
 - I’m always shocked by the people who I’m attracted to. It’s always completely random. I generally like people who are a bit crazy but yeah, that’s pretty much my only prerequisite.
 - Smaller movies are great because you don’t have to argue with so many people all the time. But really I like arguing so there’s a balance either way.
 - I think pretty much all people who love each other had some kind of thing at first sight. I mean, there has to be some kind of moment where you, like, feel a different energy around someone.

 - People who are the most normal are probably the most crazy.
 - You can’t win. The annoying thing is that you can’t attack them, but you can’t defend yourself. The best thing you could possibly do is punch a paparazzi and give them their big payday.
 - I will keep that a secret as it was so indecent I doubt she was in her normal state of mind when she made it.
 - I walked out the wrong car door and started walking into the crowd, An interviewer said, ‘Give your best horror scream,’ and Stan did this great scream, and I was too much of a wimp to do one. It was pathetic!
 - My biggest problem in my life is I’m cheap and I didn’t hire a publicist. In every awkward interview, normally actors get these things scripted.
 - I’m just scared of crowds. I just think people require things of me whenever there’s a screaming crowd, and I always think I won’t be able to provide what they want, so that’s why I look scared all the time.
 - I have a natural propensity to work on big piles of poop.
 - You have this weird thing where you end up trying to fight against this faceless blob, where the more you hate it, the bigger it gets, because it’s all in your head.
 - I used to wear my mom’s Wayfarers. When the people of Ray Ban noticed that, they sent me a box full of sunglasses, two and a half years ago. Now they’re all gone. They’ve disappeared during trips, many were also stolen from me, the rest I lost again and again. Now I have only one pair left.
 - I don’t really see the point in washing your hair. If you don’t care if your hair’s clean or not then why would you wash it?
 - People will know you for whatever they want to know you for.

 - I never understood the nudity thing. I’m so envious of people who can walk around naked.
 - So I know where my feet are.
 - Contact lenses make me miserable, as soon as I put them in. That’s what creates the pouting and brooding character.
 - We didn’t have packed lunches at my school. I was a lunch monitor as well – I used to take everyone’s chips!
 - I’ve got such effeminate hands. I could never be strong. Whenever I even got to a save, my fingers would just bend back and the ball would hit me in the face.
 - I see love as an evolution of true friendship.
 - I never do anything normal anyway. I just get other people to do it now.
 - Sometimes I think, ‘To hell with acting’ and then I realize I could be working at a shoe shop. Acting is much cooler.
 - My back is too long or something because my ass is constantly hanging out.
 - I don’t want people to hate me. I basically do whatever I want. But one of the aspects of what I want is, I want people to like me!
 - My ideal of manliness is to be incapable of doing anything.
 - If I do decide one day to stop acting, I just hate the idea of people going: ‘Oh, did you ever do anything else besides that Twilight thing?’
 - The first period of getting famous was incredibly strange to me and really fun at the beginning because you didn’t realise the consequences of anything. You could say or do whatever you wanted and it just didn’t matter.
 - I hope there is such a thing. I guess it would be quite scary to find a soul mate when you’re young because you’re probably going to mess it up.
 - I quite liked Sharkey and George and then there was a cartoon with rapper MC Hammer in it – Hammertime – I loved that cartoon, it was genius! They don’t make cartoons like that anymore.
 - I keep forgetting I’m speaking in an American accent sometimes. The dangerous thing is that you end up forgetting what your real accent is after a while! It’s really strange; I’ve never done a job in an American accent before.
 - I thought I knew it all. Again, I knew absolutely nothing.
 - I can’t deal with criticism very well. I’ve already got it from one angle. I don’t need it from anything else.
 - Umm thanks for the phone. I think I already broke it...
 - I have very, very low expenditures, but still I manage to spend it all. I guess Hot Pockets are more expensive than I thought.
 - I went to do my first big movie when I was 17. I was in South Africa for three and half months, and I was by myself.
 - I did this movie about Salvador Dali a few years ago and had hair extensions and a little bob. That was incredibly bizarre.
 - I’m so surprised it’s worked out that way. I was just thinking the whole time that I’ve never had the personality to fit into that. I’m not really afraid of it, because I don’t even know how to play up that aspect.
 - Xavier would be such a great burger. He’s all covered in spread...
 - Whenever I have to do anything fan-related there’s always a whole bunch of people. My brain kind of shuts down when there are loads of people screaming at me. I’m not thinking at all so I can’t really remember what’s happened immediately afterwards.
 - I really like Nicki Minaj. I think she’s great.
 - If it’s just screaming – and I know this sounds so ridiculous – that gets old. But sometimes when there’s literal chaos, it’s like being in a war zone, and that’s kind of exciting. You’re just running through the crowd of people chasing after you and no one knows what’s going on.
 - It’s fun to deal with the terror and the huge highs and lows of things. We’re still getting massive surprises, anytime there’s any Twilight-related event or anything.

 - I have very, very specific ideas about how I want to do my work and how I want to be perceived and to the point of ridiculousness sometimes.
 - There is a price, which you have to pay. You are 24 hours on the job, if you go out in public.
 - All of my favourite actors are American and I grew up watching American movies. It’s weird I used to do a New Jersey accent in every audition in America, because I liked it. It’s completely bizarre and everybody would ask: ‘Where are you from?’ And I would say: ‘Oh, I’m from London!’
 - I’m afraid of buying a house or anything, ’cause if there’s one paparazzi outside for one day, then they’ll never leave.
 - I wasn’t at all focused on school, and I didn’t achieve much. But I’ve got a sense of urgency now. I feel I can’t let any more time waste away.
 - It’s easy to get stagnate, if you play the same character. In New Moon, I felt like I was going a little bit deeper.
 - I’d love to be able to fit in a box. Like one of those people who fit into small boxes. I’d love it.
 - You’re trying to play an archetype on one hand and a character on the other, so I felt insanely frustrated, right up until the last shot, and then it ended.
 - I have been lucky, of course. Like, last year, if I went out, I’d have to fight to chat someone up. This year, I look exactly the same, which is really scruffy, and yet lots of people seem to have just changed their minds and decided I’m really sexy.
 - If you took away publicists and things and people spoke for themselves, then they’d have to be responsible for their words.

 - It’s funny, people were asking me how I’d feel when it all ends, on the first movie, and I don’t think I’ve ever felt more completely bewildered, knowing that I only have a month of Twilight stuff left to do.
 - When someone tells you the fundamentals you think that everything’s going to come out and be amazing.
 - I like being meticulous and it’s quite difficult as an actor to have that much control.
 - I’m always really worried about ruining their lives. Especially with people that aren’t famous. It’s such a massive change. I’m kind of a paranoid wreck. I’ve eaten a lot of room service.
 - You can put a dog in a scene and everyone’s going to be better, I guarantee it. And if they’re not better, just shoot the dog.
 - When this is over, the media will lose interest. There’ll be nothing to say. It won’t fit into a headline anymore. It won’t fit into a template.
 - I don’t listen to anyone else. That’s why I don’t have a publicist or something like that. I can’t stand it if someone’s trying to tell me to do something which might be a mistake sometimes.
 - Since the day I finished shooting there’s been at least one person come up to me every single day and then after the trailer came out, at least four. It’s absolutely bizarre to me. This was before there was any systematic promotion of the movie. It’s just completely nuts.

 - What’s it like kissing Taylor Lautner.
 - The girly movie i secretly love is Pippy Longstockings.

 - I haven’t found one place in the world yet where I could disappear.
 - I’m not one of these guys who’s constantly in a relationship, not at all.
 - Looking scary with a baseball outfit on and a little bouffant, you know, it just does not work. Especially with sculpted eyebrows.
 - I went out a couple of times with Pierce. He’s totally recognizable, and he makes no effort to tone it down. Some people were glancing over at us in the restaurant, and he just went over and introduced himself. And it does work. It dissipates all the attention. Me? I just crawl under the table.
 - The only thing that you can do is do jobs and see if people respond to that. I’m always holding onto the fact that I don’t really know who I am. Hopefully I won’t compartmentalize myself because of that, because I’m completely ignorant of the whole.
 - Only for practical reasons. To find out if I said something stupid in an interview. So I can limit the damage.

 - I think the most stressful thing in movies is when the weather is really random.
 - I think Betty White is one of the sexiest women in America.

 - I had to do two roles in two days, I’m in a hairflux.
 - I can’t say I prefer blondes, brunettes, or redheads. I like emotion and elegance. Even expensive clothes do not guarantee a good look. You must be yourself above all!

 - Money by Martin Amis. I read it when I was 15, I read it hundreds of times since then and it always makes me laugh. Amis has managed to create a world that is both funny and abrasive. I’d love to play John Self, the depraved hero, who’s without illusions, he created.
 - My little cousin tells me I look like Magneto so I guess that’s who I should probably play.
 - It’s a little bit over the top. I feel the same in my head I guess. I was quite a paranoid person anyway, so it doesn’t really feed well when people are looking at you. I’m not really in the right job. I don’t like having my photo taken. I don’t like the attention.
