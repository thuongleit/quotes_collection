 - There are always two people involved in cruelty, aren’t there? One to be vicious and someone to suffer! And what’s the use of getting rid of – of wickedness, say – in the outside world if you let it creep back into things from inside you?
 - At the same time, I think books create a sort of network in the reader’s mind, with one book reinforcing another. Some books form relationships. Other books stand in opposition. No two writers or readers have the same pattern of interaction.
 - There are certainly times when my own everyday life seems to retreat so the life of the story can take me over. That is why a writer often needs space and time, so that he or she can abandon ordinary life and “live” with the characters.
 - Time was too much a part of love, for even in fairytales the proof of love was not its first moment, but its latest ones – that people lived happily ever after. Love at first sight was nothing but infatuation until proved by time...
 - Of course there are big differences in length and character and vocabulary, but each level has its particular pleasures when it comes to the words one can use and the way one uses them.
 - I think I am too interested in my own ideas to copy anyone else’s, but I find that other people’s imagery, the flow of language in the outside world, games with words, and ideas about relationships are all most important to me.
 - At this stage I am not involved with young adults as closely as many other writers. My children are grown up and my grandchildren are still quite young.
 - I don’t think I prefer writing for one age group above another. I am just as pleased with a story which I feel works well for very small children as I do with a story for young adults.
 - Perhaps every time anyone is praised it means that someone else somewhere is going to be ignored.
 - People can say what they like about the eternal verities, love and truth and so on, but nothing’s as eternal as the dishes.
 - The novels take longer to write than the picture book texts, and they do take a different sort of concentration. However, a very short, simple story that works well is just as exciting to me as any longer and more complex book.
 - I, personally, have found reading a continual support to writing.
 - It can certainly happen that characters in more sophisticated stories can “take over” as they develop and change the author’s original ideas. Well, it certainly happens to me at times.

 - In a way, the characters often do take over.
 - When you are writing, of course, you have to do all that writing and correcting for yourself. When I was a librarian it was expected that I would know about a wide range of books.

 - You can’t say you want things to be simple and then in the next breath ask me to be honest.
