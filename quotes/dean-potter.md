 - More and more people seem to be separating from nature. I’m trying to go in a different direction. I’m getting closer and closer.
 - Entranced by the flight of a raven, I watch its shadow move effortlessly against golden, shimmering granite. I long to be that free, flying above the cluttered world of normalcy, where so many are half alive.
 - I’m a pretty wild guy and I live pretty close to nature – I’ve often lived in caves or on the edge of cliffs or in forests – so it’s just second nature for me to tap into the movings of the weather and the world.
 - I just love any place that I can sit in the sun and feel the warmth of the sun’s rays, and feel the connection to the planet, really tapping into how small I am and really how insignificant I am in comparison to the universe.
 - Calmly spinning, I scan as far away as I can see. The last rays of the day’s sun warm my back and my stare locks onto my own shadow. I follow the lines of my body on the stone in front of me, spreading my arms as wings, and bathe in the beauty of existence.

 - I don’t want to die, but I’m ok putting it all out there for the most beautiful expression of my life.
 - I have a strong feeling for it, and I think us as humans perceive all of that – the pressure change and the moon and the wind and whether a storm is moving in on us – if we just are close enough to nature.
 - Each time I saw a cliff, I wondered whether I could free solo it. My life shaped itself around the understanding that falling means I die. To break the paradigm I had to empty out my essence, rummaging for fundamentals I thought were gone forever.
 - The moment before I jump is filled with anxiety and what-ifs. But then as soon as I enter the air, I’m filled with this calmness and that’s the main attraction to it. That’s why I do these death-consequence pursuits or arts.
