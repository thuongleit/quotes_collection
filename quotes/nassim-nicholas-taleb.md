 - Anything that provides you with very, very stable income, very stable conditions, maybe generally stable, that often, it masks real risks, risks of blow-ups.

 - Probability is not about the odds, but about the belief in the existence of an alternative outcome, cause, or motive.
 - I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or “incentives” for skill.

 - At no point in history have so many non-risk-takers, that is, those with no personal exposure, exerted so much control.
 - If you roll dice, you know that the odds are one in six that the dice will come up on a particular side. So you can calculate the risk. But, in the stock market, such computations are bull – you don’t even know how many sides the dice have!
 - The person you are most afraid to contradict is yourself.
 - An erudite is someone who displays less than he knows; a journalist or consultant the opposite.
