 - If the dead could speak there would be no more war.
 - Behind every word a whole world is hidden that must be imagined.
 - One ought to go too far, in order to know how far one can go.
 - I need very little reality.
 - Strangely enough I like the kind to which I belong: people.
 - Oh, that ludicrous virile earnestness!
 - An artist is like a woman who can do nothing but love, and who succumbs to every stray male jackass.
