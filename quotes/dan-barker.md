 - There is joy in rationality, happiness in clarity of mind. Freethought is thrilling and fulfilling – absolutely essential to mental health and happiness.
 - Asking, ‘If there is no God, what is the purpose of life?’ is like asking, ‘If there is no master, whose slave will I be?’ If your purpose of life is to submit as a slave, then your meaning comes from flattering the ego of a person whom you should detest.
 - Basic atheism is not a belief. It is the lack of belief. There is a difference between believing there is no god and not believing there is a god – both are atheistic, though popular usage has ignored the latter.
 - I’m proud to be an atheist – it helps me stand for so much more and fall for so much less.
 - All you have to do is walk into any children’s hospital and you know there is no God. Prayer doesn’t make any difference. Those people pray for their beloved children to live and they die.

 - People are always asking, “What’s the purpose of life?” That’s easy. Relieve suffering. Create beauty. Make gardens.
 - Some theists, observing that all ‘effects’ need a cause, assert that God is a cause but not an effect. But no one has ever observed an uncaused cause and simply inventing one merely assumes what the argument wishes to prove.
 - Scientists do not join hands every Sunday and sing “Yes gravity is real! I know gravity is real! I will have faith! I believe in my heart that what goes up, up, up must come down, down, down. Amen!” If they did, we would think they were pretty insecure about the concept.
 - You keep accusing me of blasphemy all of the time, but I cannot be convicted of a victimless crime.

 - Prayer never changes the laws of nature.
 - In any open question, we should argue from what we do know to what we do not know. We do know that fervent legends and stubborn myths arise easily and naturally. We do not know that dead people rise from the grave.

 - If the Prodigal Son’s a parable, and if Adam and Eve are metaphors, then maybe God is just figure of speech.

 - I threw out all the bath water, and there was no baby there.
 - Look at the posture of prayer. It is the posture of slavery, of bowing before your master. We are a proudly rebellious country. We kicked out the master. Now here comes the government telling us to humbly bow again.
 - If faith is a valid tool of knowledge, then anything can be true ‘by faith,’ and therefore nothing is true. If the only reason you can accept a claim is by faith, then you are admitting that the claim does not stand on its own merits.
 - It’s not easy to change world views. Faith has its own momentum and belief is comfortable. To restructure reality is traumatic and scary. That is why many intelligent people continue to believe: unbelief is an unknown.
 - I took about a year to fully adjust. Like there’s a death at the family or a divorce, you don’t just snap your fingers and it’s over.

 - If the answers to prayer are merely what God wills all along, then why pray?
 - It is a fact of history and of current events that human beings exaggerate, misinterpret, or wrongly remember events. They have also fabricated pious fraud. Most believers in a religion understand this when examining the claims of other religions.
