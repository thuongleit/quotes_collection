 - I do not sleep; I wish to meet my death awake.
 - While other nations do battle, you lucky Austria, you wed.
 - If I could wish for immortality on earth, it would only be for the power of relieving the distressed.
 - I found myself without money, without credit, without army, without experience and knowledge of my own and finally, also without any counsel because each one of them at first wanted to wait and see how things would develop.
