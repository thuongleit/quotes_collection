 - Of two evils, choose neither.
 - Trust in God alone, and lean not on the needs of human help. Be not surprised when friends fail you; it is a failing world. Never reckon upon immutability in man: inconstancy you may reckon upon without fear of disappointment.

 - There is hardship in everything except eating pancakes.

 - Oh my brethren, Bold hearted men are always called mean-spirited by cowards!
 - The fear of God is the death of every other fear; like a mighty lion, it chases all other fears before it.
 - No sin is necessarily connected with sorrow of heart, for Jesus Christ our Lord once said, “My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.” There was no sin in Him, and consequently none in His deep depression.
 - We cannot play at preaching. We preach for eternity.
 - You cannot be Christ’s servant if you are not willing to follow him, cross and all. What do you crave? A crown? Then it must be a crown of thorns if you are to be like him. Do you want to be lifted up? So you shall, but it will be upon a cross.
 - So long as we are receivers of mercy, we must be givers of thanks.
 - Next to the Bible, the book I value most is John Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress. I believe I have read it through at least a hundred times. It is a volume of which I never seem to tire; and the secret of its freshness is that it is so largely compiled from the Scriptures.
 - Prayer meetings are the throbbing machinery of the church.
 - The highest science, the loftiest speculation, the mightiest philosophy, which can ever engage the attention of a child of God, is the name, the nature, the person, the work, the doings, and the existence of the great God whom he calls his Father.

 - Wisdom is the right use of knowledge.
 - Oh, without prayer what are the church’s agencies, but the stretching out of a dead man’s arm, or the lifting up of the lid of a blind man’s eye? Only when the Holy Spirit comes is there any life and force and power.
 - To be a soul winner is the happiest thing in the world. And with every soul you bring to Jesus Christ, you seem to get a new heaven here upon earth.
 - Don’t let your hopes or fears come between you and Jesus; follow hard after Him. He will never fail you.
 - A person who is really saved by Grace does not need to be told that he is under solemn obligations to serve Christ. The new life within him tells him that. Instead of regarding it as a burden, he gladly surrenders himself, body, soul, and spirit, to the Lord.
 - Live in such a way that men may recognize that you have been with Jesus.
 - Our extremities are God’s opportunities.
 - One might better try to sail the Atlantic in a paper boat, than try to get to heaven on good works.

 - Must is a hard nut to crack, but it has a sweet kernel.
 - Infinite, and an infant. Eternal, and yet born of a woman. Almighty, and yet hanging on a woman’s breast. Supporting a universe, and yet needing to be carried in a mother’s arms. King of angels, and yet the reputed son of Joseph. Heir of all things, and yet the carpenter’s despised son.
 - There is dust enough on some of your Bibles to write ‘damnation’ with your fingers.

 - Growing a beard is a habit most natural, Scriptural, manly and beneficial.
 - I would to God that saints would cling to Christ half as earnestly as sinners cling to the devil. If we were as willing to suffer for God as some are to suffer for their lusts, what perseverance and zeal would be seen on all sides!
 - Defend the Bible? I’d sooner defend a lion. You don’t defend the Bible; you open its cage and let it roar.

 - When I have found intense pain relieved, a weary brain soothed, and calm refreshing sleep obtained by a cigar, I have felt grateful to God, and have blessed His name.
 - We Christians do not believe that Jesus Christ was the only one that ever rose from the dead. We believe that every death-bed is a resurrection; that from every grave the stone, is rolled away.

 - Christian, beware of thinking lightly of sin. Take heed in case you fall little by little.
 - It is not the strength of your faith that saves you, but the strength of Him upon whom you rely! Christ is able to save you if you come to Him-be your faith weak or be it strong.

 - Let us measure ourselves by our Master, and not by our fellow-servants : then pride will be impossible.
 - Free will I have often heard of, but I have never seen it. I have always met with will, and plenty of it, but it has either been led captive by sin or held in the blessed bonds of grace.
 - The religion of both Old and New Testaments is marked by fervent outspoken testimonies against evil. To speak smooth things in such a case may be sentimentalism, but it is not Christianity. It is a betrayal of the cause of truth and righteousness.
 - I will go as far as Martin Luther, where he says, ‘If any man ascribes anything of salvation, even the very least thing, to the free will of man, he knows nothing of grace, and he has not learned Jesus Christ rightly.’
 - Repentance will not make you see Christ; but to see Christ will give you repentance.
 - Do not try to make the gospel tasteful to carnal minds. Do not hide the offense of the cross, lest you make it of no effect.
 - The moment the church of God shall despise the pulpit, God will despise her.
 - If you wait for a perfect church, you must wait until you get to heaven; and even if you could find a perfect assembly on earth, I am sure they would not admit you to their fellowship, for you are not perfect yourself.

 - When you see no present advantage, walk by faith and not by sight. Do God the honor to trust Him when it comes to matters of loss for the sake of principle.
 - The Lord Jesus is a deep sea of joy; my soul shall dive therein, shall be swallowed up in the delights of his society.
 - Many people are born crying, live complaining, and die disappointed; they chew the bitter pill which they would not even know to be bitter if they had the sense to swallow it whole in a cup of patience and water.
 - Unless you have forgiven others you read your own death warrant when you repeat the Lord’s Prayer.
 - Death has no sting to a Believer. Once death was the penalty of sin-sin being forgiven, the penalty ceases and Christians do not die, now, as a punishment for their sin, but they die that they may be prepared to live!
 - Prayer pulls the rope below and the great bell rings above in the ears of God. Some scarcely stir the bell, for they pray so languidly. Others give but an occasional pluck at the rope. But he who wins with heaven is the man who grasps the rope boldly and pulls continuously, with all his might.
 - All originality and no plagiarism makes for dull preaching.
 - When you speak of heaven, let your face light up; let it be irradiated by a heavenly gleam; let your eyes shine with reflected glory. But when you speak of hell, your ordinary expression will do.

 - Whatever a man depends upon, whatever rules his mind, whatever governs his affections, whatever is the chief object of his delight, is his god.

 - A thrifty housewife is better than a great income. A good wife and health are a man’s best wealth.

 - Now let us find solace in the finished work of our Lord Jesus. Everything is fully done: justice demands no more.

 - May your convictions be deep, your love real, and your desires earnest.

 - Little learning and much pride come of hasty reading.
 - The Providence of God is the great protector of our life and usefulness, and under the divine care we are perfectly safe from danger.
 - I believe that very much of current Arminianism is simply ignorance of gospel doctrine; and if people began to study their Bibles, and to take the Word of God as they find it, they must inevitably, if believers, rise up to rejoice in the doctrines of grace.
 - The love of Jesus is the source of salvation. He loves, he looks, he touches us, we live.
 - Our griefs cannot mar the melody of our praise, we reckon them to be the bass part of our life’s song, ‘He hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.’
 - Depend on it, my hearer, you never will go to heaven unless you are prepared to worship Jesus Christ as God.

 - This is faith, receiving the truth of Christ; first knowing it to be true, and then acting upon that belief.

 - The world’s one and only remedy is the cross.
 - There is no exception to this rule: “All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant.” They say there is no rule without an exception, but there is an exception to that rule.

 - God gave us sleep to remind us we are not him.
 - If you tell your troubles to God, you put them into the grave; they will never rise again when you have committed them to Him. If you roll your burden anywhere else, it will roll back again like the stone of Sisyphus.

 - If heaven were by merit, it would never be heaven to me, for if I were in it I should say, “I am sure I am here by mistake; I am sure this is not my place; I have no claim to it.” But if it be of grace and not of works, then we may walk into heaven with boldness.

 - Prayer is the autograph of the Holy Ghost upon the renewed heart.
 - Sin has been pardoned at such a price that we cannot henceforth trifle with it.
 - I have my own opinion that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and Him crucified, unless we preach what nowadays is called Calvinism. It is a nickname to call it Calvinism; Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else.
 - The world’s proverb is, “God help the poor, for the rich can help themselves;” but to our mind, it is just the rich who have most need of Heaven’s help. Dives in scarlet is worse off than Lazarus in rags, unless Divine love shall uphold him.
 - For a successful season of prayer, the best beginning is confession.
 - I am convinced that there is no great distance between heaven and earth, that the distance lies in our finite minds. When the Beloved visits us in the night, He turns our chambers into the vestibules of His palace halls. Earth rises to heaven when heaven comes down to earth.

 - If you simply take the name of Christ upon you and call yourself His servant, yet do not obey Him, but follow your own whim, or your own hereditary prejudice, or the custom of some erroneous church-you are no servant of Christ.
