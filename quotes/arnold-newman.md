 - Photography is 1% talent and 99% moving furniture.
 - A lot of photographers think that if they buy a better camera they’ll be able to take better photographs. A better camera won’t do a thing for you if you don’t have anything in your head or in your heart.
 - The camera is a mirror with a memory, but it cannot think.
 - It seems to me that no one picture can ever be a final summation of a personality. There are so many facets in every human being that it is impossible to present them all in one photograph.
 - Those who call themselves art photographers are pompous, arrogant egoists.
 - I didn’t set out to do something different so much as do something that interested me. I wasn’t trying to be avant-garde – that’s being fashionable. You don’t set out to revolutionize art, you make statements for yourself.
 - There are no rules and regulations for perfect composition. If there were we would be able to put all the information into a computer and would come out with a masterpiece. We know that’s impossible. You have to compose by the seat of your pants.
 - I am convinced that any photographic attempt to show the complete man is nonsense. We can only show, as best we can, what the outer man reveals. The inner man is seldom revealed to anyone, sometimes not even the man himself.
 - Visual ideas combined with technology combined with personal interpretation equals photography. Each must hold it’s own; if it doesn’t, the thing collapses.
 - We do not make photographs with our cameras. We make them with our minds, with our hearts, with our ideas.
 - Photography, as we all know, is not real at all. It is an illusion of reality with which we create our own private world.
 - I often wonder whether I would have done as well in painting.
