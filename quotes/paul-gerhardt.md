 - When a man lies he murders some part of the world. These are the pale deaths men miscall their lives.
 - Through waves and clouds and storms His power will clear your way; Wait for his time; the darkest night Shall end in brightest day.
 - Commit whatever grieves thee into the gracious hands of Him who never leaves thee, who heav’n and earth commands. Who points the clouds their courses, Whom winds and waves obey, He will direct thy footsteps and find for thee a way.
 - Pray absolutely for those things you may pray for absolutely. Pray conditionally for those things you may pray for conditionally. For those things you can’t pray for – don’t.
