 - I am still a Liverpool fan and will be forever, absolutely.
 - I had five great years at Liverpool and I would rather just keep that memory as it is.
 - We will have to go to win. Thereâ€™s no other option. We have one more match.
 - As long as we have the possibility then we still have to fight for it.
 - I left Real Madrid for the same reason Di Maria did. We work hard but only others get the praise.
 - I tried to do everything just as I would before any other match, but it was impossible.
