 - PhD, MFA, self-taught – the only things you must have to become a writer are the stamina to continue and a wily, cagey heart in the face of extremity, failure, and success.
 - The ideal editor will hold you to the best of yourself in the piece.
 - As I get ready to buy a new computer, I’m stunned at all the many micro drafts, of different chapters and scenes and whatnot, that litter the hard drive.
 - Characters to me are like sonnets, they have limits that you obey which allow a force to enter in, an invention that makes the novel possible. Change the limits and the force leaves. The novel becomes impossible.
 - Most written work is a conversation between the editor and the writer, that the writer essentially fulfills in public, and the editor provides the stage for that to happen as well as the prompts.
 - With my family background – my parents were both activists – writing about culture and politics came naturally.
 - As writer pay declined and teacher pay also, we all started hanging out online. You could say online social networks cheapen our friendships or you could say we were cheapened by a plutocratic power grab and this is all we can afford.

 - Each source that I read, I would look through the bibliography and the footnotes, and use that as a map for the next thing I would read.
