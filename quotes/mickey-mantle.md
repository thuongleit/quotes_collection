 - Hey man! Get away from me!
 - During my 18 years I came to bat almost 10,000 times. I struck out about 1,700 times and walked maybe 1,800 times. You figure a ballplayer will average about 500 at bats a season. That means I played seven years without ever hitting the ball.

 - My biggest regret was letting my lifetime average drop below .300. I always felt I was a .300 hitter, and if I could change one thing that would be it.

 - Not after all the time my dad spent teaching me to switch-hit.
 - I guess you could say I’m what this country is all about.
 - Bravery is a complicated thing to describe. You can’t say it’s three feet long and two feet wide and that it weighs four hundred pounds or that it’s colored bright blue or that it sounds like a piano or that it smells like roses. It’s a quality, not a thing.
 - Butcher boy, damn it, butcher boy.
 - There are two kinds of people. There are leaders and there are followers. And I’m a follower.

 - Roger Maris was as good a man and as good a ballplayer as there ever was.
 - I never saw him fight. I never saw Billy fight.
 - The hardest thing to do in sports, I think, is to hit a home run.
 - Casey wanted us to stay loose. That didn’t mean clowning around. He just meant we should be confident and relaxed. We shouldn’t feel that one strikeout was going to end the season for us.
 - I’ll play baseball for the Army or fight for it, whatever they want me to do.
 - Casey didn’t easily forgive a guy who got doubled up on a hit-and-run play. He didn’t see any reason why the runner couldn’t take a quick glance back toward the plate to make sure the ball was hit safely.

 - My dad taught me to switch-hit. He and my grandfather, who was left-handed, pitched to me every day after school in the back yard. I batted lefty against my dad and righty against my granddad.
 - I’ve often wondered how a man who knew he was going to die could stand here and say he was the luckiest man on the face of the earth, but now I guess I know how he felt.
 - If the World Series was on the line and I could pick one pitcher to pitch the game, I’d choose Whitey Ford every time.
 - When I’m hitting, I’d play for nothing. When I’m not, any kind of money I receive makes me feel as if I’m stealing.

 - As far as I’m concerned, Aaron is the best ball player of my era. He is to baseball of the last fifteen years what Joe DiMaggio was before him. He’s never received the credit he’s due.
 - Of course, I didn’t tell you about all the times I said I was going to hit one and it didn’t happen.
 - I played seven years without ever hitting the ball.
 - The thing I really liked about Mickey was the way he treated everyone the same.
 - He can run, steal bases, throw, hit for average, and hit with power like I’ve never seen. Just don’t put him at shortstop.
