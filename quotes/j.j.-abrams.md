 - I think admitting youre an addict is the first step towards recovery.
 - It’s a leap of faith doing any serialised storytelling.
 - There are always a bunch of ideas floating around and I do the best that I can to try to not do them. The ideas don’t go away and, over time, are finally like, “Okay, it’s been around so long, I have to get this thing out,” and it somehow ends up coming to some version of fruition.
 - Every hour that you spend doing something, even if you love it more than anything, you’re not with your family. Every project that you take on, that’s another choice.

 - I’m an impatient guy and tend not to like to stay with one thing for a long time. I’ll never be able to write as many scripts as I did for “Felicity” or “Alias” ever again. I’m just too impatient these days. I want to get on to the next project.
 - It’s not a bad way to live once you let go of the idea that you deserve more.

 - I do feel like no matter what you’re doing, whether it’s music or writing a play or a poem or drawing a picture or painting something, that you’re speaking to what is it you want to express, what is it you want to see.
 - I have no style. There are certain people who just have a visual sense that defines their work. You could probably watch 30 seconds of anything they do and you’ll know exactly who directed it. I don’t have that skill.
 - To me the interesting main character is never the one without flaws.
 - It’s what happens. You love, then you lose, then you die. Even if you survive, you die.
 - I think that even if you’re wondering if two characters are ever going to kiss, drawing out the inevitability is part of the fun. Whatever the genre happens to be.

 - Ratings have changed, viewer habits have changed and the options for the audience have grown enormously, but I don’t think how you tell a story is fundamentally different.
 - It is an incredible thing to see how many crazy things get thrown out that people then often write commentaries about how happy they are or how disappointed they are about something that’s completely false. But, it’s a lot of noise, frankly.

 - The ability of a television series to make adjustments is something you’ve got to take advantage of.
