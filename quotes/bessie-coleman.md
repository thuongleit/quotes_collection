 - Tell them that as soon as I can walk Iâ€™m going to fly!
 - I refused to take no for an answer.
 - The air is the only place free from prejudices.
 - If I can create the minimum of my plans and desires there shall be no regrets.
 - I decided blacks should not have to experience the difficulties I had faced, so I decided to open a flying school and teach other black women to fly.
