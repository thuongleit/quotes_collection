 - Just because I’m not forever by your side doesn’t mean that’s not precisely where I want to be.
 - Love simply is – it asks no permissions. Acceptance is all love asks, the only demand it makes, but it is an absolute one. You can either admit it to your heart or refuse it, but there’s no other option.
 - Love wasn’t a happening one decided on – to indulge or not, to partake or not. To feel or not. When it came, when it struck, the only decision left to make was how to respond – whether you embraced it, took it in, and made it a part of you, or whether you turned your back and let it die.
 - Abstinence. It didn’t even sound comfortable.
