 - Itâ€™s a misconception that Beauty is in the Eyes of beholder. In my view, Beauty must be in the Heart of beholder for her true appreciation.
 - Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly lies to the bone. Beauty dies and fades away, but ugly holds its own! Create and cultivate Inner Beauty that never fades away but grows and matures with Time!
