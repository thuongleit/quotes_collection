 - In an age of relativism, orthodoxy is the only possible rebellion left.
 - Trying to fill the God-sized hole in our hearts with things other than God is like trying to fill the Grand Canyon with marbles.

 - We are artists, because God is.
 - There is one and only one possible road to joy: selfless love.
 - Bad times make good people, as mountainous pressures make diamonds or as fire tempers steel.
 - On my door is a cartoon of two turtles. One says, ‘Sometimes I would like to ask why he allows poverty, famine and injustice when he could do something about it.’ The other turtle says ‘I am afraid that God might ask me the same question.’
 - If God is not a Trinity, God is not love. For love requires three things: a lover, a beloved, and a relationship between them.

 - Diversion and indifference are the two widest roads to Hell in today’s world.
 - Control language and you control thought; control thought and you control action; control action and you control the world.
 - Ethics without virtue is an illusion. What is the highest purpose of ethics? It is to make a person good, that is virtuous.
 - All human beings have a right to life. Our unborn children are members of the human race. They’re human beings, so they have a right to life.
 - Actually, we have misdefined “hypocrisy.” Hypocrisy is not the failure to practice what you preach but the failure to believe it. Hypocrisy is propaganda.
 - Agape’s object is always the concrete individual, not some abstraction called humanity. Love of humanity is easy because humanity does not surprise you with inconvenient demands. You never find humanity on your doorstep, stinking and begging.

 - Gratitude is the seedbed of joy.
 - Without that freedom to sin there is also no freedom to love.
 - The opposite of Christianity is not atheism, but idolatry.
 - Other religions are stories of man’s search for God. The Bible is the story of God’s search for man.

 - Everything smaller than Heaven bores us because only Heaven is bigger than our hearts.
 - A pure heart means a single heart, a heart in which only one desire lives: love.

 - The best answer to the problem of evil is not one so much found on paper but on wood.
 - No one justifies lying, cheating, betraying, promise breaking, devastating and harming strangers. But we expect and we tolerate doing this to the one person in the world we promised most seriously to be faithful to forever: we justify divorce.
 - It is mercy, not justice or courage or even heroism, that alone can defeat evil.
 - Great saints have often been made out of great sinners, but not one was ever made out of a wimp.
 - The most total opposite of pleasure is not pain but boredom, for we are willing to risk pain to make a boring life interesting.

 - Life is hard, but death is even harder.
 - Be egalitarian regarding persons. Be elitist regarding ideas.
 - Science only answers the question, How does it work? Or at most, What’s there? Science asks what and how, philosophy asks why, myth and religion ask who. Who’s in charge here? Who’s the author? That’s what we really long to know.
 - Envy, though not the greatest sin, is the only one that gives the sinner no pleasure at all, not even fake and temporary satisfaction.
 - Original sin is the proclivity to say “my will be done” instead of “thy will be done.”
 - The most compelling evidence for God’s existence is Christ. If God does not exist, then Christ was the biggest fool who ever lived.
 - Pilate’s skeptical sneer “What is truth?” was addressed to Truth Himself, standing there right in front of his face. The world’s stupidest question was three words; God’s profoundest answer was one Word.
 - Thus moral theology leads us four steps deeper than law. To fulfill the moral law, we need love. To get love, we need union with God. To get union with God, we need the new birth. And to get the new birth, we need faith.
 - Mary’s light is like that of the moon, totally reflected from the sun, the Son of God.
 - The six things in life that never get boring are knowing and loving God, your neighbor, and yourself.
 - When you give yourself away you find that a new and more real self has somehow been given to you.
 - A God who did not abolish suffering-worse, a God who abolished sin precisely by suffering-is a scandal to the modern mind.
 - The self is like a baseball. Throw it back to the divine pitcher who pitched it to you in the first place, and the game of love goes on. Hold it, and the game is over. That is the difference between Heaven and Hell.
 - It is reasonable to love the Absolute absolutely for the same reason it is reasonable to love the relative relatively.
 - To worship a crocodile is better to worship yourself.
 - An open mind is not an end in itself but a means to the end of finding truth.
 - God allows unjust disparities between rich and poor because He does not miraculously intervene to establish justice against human wills. Also, discrepancies are not unjust by themselves; justice does not mean equality of result but equality of opportunity.
 - If a person claims to have met Jesus without being changed then they have not met the real Jesus.
 - You have an evil twin who is always with you. He is called your ego.
 - Love is the binding force on every level of existence.
 - If God is the Creator of all things and evil is a thing, then God is the Creator of evil and He is to be blamed for its existence. No, evil is not a thing but a wrong choice, or the damage done by a wrong choice. Evil is no more a positive thing than blindness is, but it is just as real.
 - Abortion is the insurance against that fate worse than death which is called a family.
 - Moral stupidity comes in two different forms: relativism and legalism. Relativism sees no principles, only people; legalism sees no people, only principles.
 - The big, blazing truth about man is that he has a heaven-sized hole in his heart, and nothing else can fill it. We pass our lives trying to fill the Grand Canyon with marbles. As Augustine said: Thou hast made us for Thyself, and our hearts are restless until they rest in Thee.
 - Our life here on Earth has as its purpose precisely to prepare for our eternal happiness. This world is a large womb. It is a ‘test’ as all opportunities are tests.

 - We do not do good works to get into heaven; we do good works because heaven has gotten to us.

 - The heart is like a woman, and the head is like a man, and although man is the head of woman, woman is the heart of man, and she turns man’s head because she turns his heart.
 - God calls us, just as he called Abraham, away from the security we knew, out of our old, familiar, little room, down the ladder of faith and into his arms. Jesus called his disciples that way – just as a lover elopes with his beloved.
 - Peace is a mark of the Holy Spirit.
 - There is no scientific proof that only scientific proofs are good proofs; no way to prove by the scientific method that the scientific method is the only valid method.
 - Thanksgiving comes after Christmas.
 - God’s interventions are miracles: events that cannot happen by merely natural agents but only by a supernatural agent. They no more interfere with our free will than natural events like earthquakes. We choose how to respond to them.
 - Every blade of grass is a blade of grace, a grace note in God’s single Song. Nature is not blind and dumb. Nature is eloquent. Human science is blind and dumb if it does not hear this eloquence.
 - Conscience is thus explained only as the voice of God in the soul.
 - True love, unlike popular sentimental substitutes, is willing to suffer. Love is not “luv.” Love is the cross. Our problem at first, the sheer problem of suffering, was a cross without Christ. We must never fall into the opposite and equal trap of a Christ without a cross.

 - All of history is a kind of broken marriage and God puts it back together again.
 - For the wise men of old, the cardinal problem of human life was how to conform the soul to objective reality, and the solution was wisdom, self-discipline, and virtue. For the modern, the cardinal problem is how to conform reality to the wishes of man, and the solution is a technique.

 - Faith is not like bottled water but like rain. Its destiny is not just to be kept and held but to make something visible grow.
 - The love of God is no human projection, but the wrath of God is. In fact, what we call the wrath of God is really the love of God experienced by a fool.
 - To God each one of us is His favorite. God’s love comes to all, but it comes to all as each, not to all as some anonymous aggregate.
 - How will the Tower of Babel be undone? How will we understand each other in Heaven? Will we all speak English or Dutch or Latin? No, we will speak music.
 - Our destiny is to be so intimately united with God that, as the mystics say, we not only see God’s face but also see with God’s face.

 - Few Christians go into media or the arts today, or see it as a primary mission field or battlefield. But it is.
 - You see, God just will not let us flunk out of His school of love. He insists on remedial lessons until we get it right. For this whole world is a school set up by Love Himself to teach us to love.

 - Like apes, we breed, sleep, and die. Yet like God we say, “I am.” We are ontological oxymorons.

 - God’s wraith is really only the face of love refused.

 - Life is always fatal. No one gets out of it alive.

 - You have to say no to something else, in order to make time to pray.

 - If we had absolute proof instead of clues, then you could no more deny God than you could deny the sun. If we had no evidence at all, you could never get there. God gives us just enough evidence so that those who want him can have him.
