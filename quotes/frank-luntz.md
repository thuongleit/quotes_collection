 - It’s not what you say, it’s what people hear.

 - A compelling story, even if factually inaccurate, can be more emotionally compelling than a dry recitation of the truth.
 - Ideology and communication more often than not run into each other rather than complement each other. Principle and communication work together. Ideology and communication often work apart.
 - Nobody wants to hear about process. They want to hear about results. They want to be inspired. They want to aspire to something. And so often in our communication, we will explain why – sorry, we will explain how but not why.

 - Traditional market researchers are cold and calculating and scientific.
 - What matters most in politics is personality. It’s not issues; it’s not image. It’s who you are and what you represent.
 - When you say: The simple truth is this, and then you pause, and then you finish the sentence, people stop, and they think specifically about what you’re saying. And it’s, in essence, trying to boil it down to something that’s very understandable and meaningful.

 - If you just heard 90 percent of dentists recommend something, it’s too statistical. Nine out of 10 says: Well, it’s just virtually everyone. It leads you to think of that joke about the one dentist. But so much of communication.
 - I would not have used the phrase “I’m selling you” because even though that’s exactly what you’re doing, when you tell people you’re doing it – or worse yet, when you tell people “I’m not here to sell you anything,” they automatically assume that that’s exactly what you are here to do.
