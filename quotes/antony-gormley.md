 - Art is not about understanding, it’s about experience.
 - Our appearance belongs to others, we live in the darkness of the body-part of all darkness but felt.
 - I want to start where language ends.
 - We are not moving towards some kind of goal. We are at the goal, and it is changing with us. If art has any purpose, it is to open our eyes to that fact.

 - The elemental world we all live in is the darkness of the body.
 - I believe in the city as a natural human environment, but we must humanize it. It’s art that will re-define public space in the 21st Century. We can make our cities diverse, inspirational places by putting art, dance and performance in all its forms into the matrix of street life.

 - Art has to change things, and if it was immediately acceptable it would not be doing the job.
 - I always like to look for adventure when I go away. I have gone on several horse adventures with my wife – from Guangxi we went up to the High Tibetan region. We also went along the Hurunui River on horseback in the South Island of New Zealand.
