 - Do no sinful action, speak no angry word; ye belong to Jesus, children of the Lord.
 - He gave us eyes to see them, And lips that we might tell How great is God Almighty, Who has made all things well.
 - The rich man in his castle, The poor man at his gate, God made them, high or lowly, And order’d their estate.
 - There is a green hill far away, Without a city wall, Where the dear Lord was crucified, Who died to save us all.
 - Christian children all must be mild, obedient, good as He.
 - He guides us into pastures green, He leads to bowers of bliss, Our Father lives, the God unseen, and Christ our Shepherd is.
 - Praise Him early, praise Him late, for our high and holy state; born, baptized, redeem’d forever, nought but sin our souls can sever from the Saviour who has bought us, from the Spirit who has taught us. Lord! renew us day by day, never let us fall away.
 - When the friends we love the best Lie in their churchyard bed, We must not cry too bitterly Over the happy dead.
