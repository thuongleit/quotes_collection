 - True art is alive and inspired by humanity. I believe that art helps us to be free from aggression and depression.
 - I tried different techniques during my career, but I especially fell in love with painting with oil and pallette-knife. Every artwork is the result of long painting process; every canvas is born during the creative search; every painting is full of my inner world.
 - I paint because this is what I love to do. I have been painting since I was a kid and my dream was to become a well known professional artist.
