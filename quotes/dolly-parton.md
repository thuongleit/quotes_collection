 - I wouldn’t wanna go out not looking like the Dolly people have come to know, because I’ve come to know her that way, too.
 - A lot of people have said I’d have probably done better in my career if I hadn’t looked so cheap and gaudy. But I dress to be comfortable for me, and you shouldn’t be blamed because you want to look pretty.

 - I’m not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I’m not dumb – and I’m not blonde either.
 - Here you come again, looking better than a body has a right to.
 - I’ve never had a divorce, but I’ve seen so many of my friends, my sister, my family go through that stuff, so I try to write for the people that can’t write about it. I take on their sorrow, so I’m able to kind of express it, or their joy.
 - If people think I’m a dumb blonde, because of the way I look, then they’re dumber than they think I am. If people think I’m not very deep because of my wigs and outfits, then they’re not very deep.

 - I’ll never harden my heart but I’ve toughened the muscles around it.
 - After you reach a certain age, they think you’re over. Well, I will never be over. I’ll be making records if I have to sell them out of the trunk of my car. I’ve done that in my past, and I’d do it again.

 - The only way I’d be caught without makeup is if my radio fell in the bathtub while I was taking a bath and electrocuted me and I was in between makeup at home. I hope my husband would slap a little lipstick on me before he took me to the morgue.

 - When its family, you tolerate what you’d kill others for.
 - Music, I suppose, will be the thing that sustains me in the time of my life when I am too old for sex and not quite ready to meet God. It has always been an essential part of me.

 - I’m comfortable in my own skin, no matter how far it’s stretched. Ha ha.
 - I count my blessings far more than I count my money.
