 - Qigong is the art and science of refining and cultivating internal energy.
 - A cup of tea is a cup of peace.
 - Silence is the foundation of truth. Words are most meaningful when they emerge from silence and when they are received by a quiet mind.
 - Stillness and action are relative, not absolute, principles. It is important to find a balance of yin and yang, not just in qigong, but in everyday life. In movement, seek stillness and rest. In rest, be mindful and attentive.
 - The more qi-full you are, the more cheerful you are.
