 - For me, a record is valid when I actually hold the vinyl. Like, I’ve worked on the art for a while and I see the vinyl and I go “Ooh, it’s an actual LP. How cool is that?” That’s very sacred to me. You can’t take that back, you know?
 - A lot of my songs, they’re like puzzle pieces, and there’s just one way to put them together. You could, if you needed to, get the scissors out and cut up things to make them work. But I don’t want to do that.
 - It’s hard to be bipolar and bicoastal at the same time.
 - It’s really very easy for me to be in The Cardinals, because I bring my voice, my guitar, and my songs to them, and then we all play around to find out what works.
 - Maybe I am a jerk sometimes. Maybe I’m not. I think most people are kind of a jerk once in a while.
 - Being a rock musician is already like ego-tripping hardcore. You’re self-consumed, and you’re always thinking. It’s really easy to say, “I’m going to write a song about this situation, and when I’m done, everyone will care.” To everybody else, that’s ego-tripping.

 - Words may move but they’re never moving fast enough.

 - While you can fill every heart as your own full of laughter loud as gold and passion quick as silver.
 - For any producer I’ve ever worked with, their toughest job is to convince me to not to obscure my vocals. A lot of people don’t like the sound of their own voice on, like, cassette tape or something. It’s like that for me, and other songwriters I know. Like, “Oh God, that’s what I sound like?”
 - The good thing about playing the guitar: You can take on different kinds of music. I’m always doing something different from the last thing I did because I have the shortest attention span on earth.

 - It’s hard to view myself sometimes as even in the same league as other musicians, mainly because there’s so much music before me. I feel overinformed by different styles and different possibilities.

 - I think that music, or at least the kind of music that I make, benefits greatly from improvisation.
 - Forever only takes its toll on some.
 - The process of making music is more interesting to me than the end result. If I was a cook, I’d be more interested in cooking food than eating food.
 - It sounds like I’m channeling or something, and I don’t really fully understand what it is. I’ll get a piece of paper and write down what I think is coming to me. And I’ll play it once. Whether it’s being recorded or not, I can then usually remember it for a sometimes shocking amount of time.
 - The night destroys the sun.
 - I don’t think, that all my stuff could’ve been records. Some, maybe. The ones that I really wanted to be records, those are the ones that are going into the box.
 - To make a song is a gift, and once it’s done it keeps evolving and changing and becomes a tool to interact with other people. It’s like a conversation.

 - I was a nervous young man. I wanted to do so many things. And I was so enthusiastic and earnestly in love with so many things that I tried too hard. I tried really, really hard. And I made a lot of mistakes. I was afraid of a lot of stuff. And I kind of feel bad for that person I was.

 - I’ve gotten to a place where I still love to play and sing, but I don’t have any ego agenda left, outside of just wanting to stay in a creative place and play music. I much prefer to sing for somebody else, and to somebody else.

 - I use to be panicked, but know I’m curious!
 - There definitely isn’t a structure anymore to how I get ideas. A lot of times I’ll just write down a phrase, or I’ll have an idea that’s attached to just a few chords. Other times, it’s work.
 - You can imagine several scenes from Star Wars? The way they looked? For me, that’s how music is. Sometimes I’ll be developing riffs for songs, just while I’m sitting around and not playing.
 - That’s why I played music; my social skills were limited. I think a lot of people that experience that pick up guitars, because they can’t communicate otherwise.

 - I’m a big music fan outside of the music I make.
 - I no longer know the author of this book, for simply stopping long enough and writing it down was where I changed from a boy with his eyes squeezed shut to a man with his eyes wide open so that the sunlight might reach my heart despite all that darkness.
