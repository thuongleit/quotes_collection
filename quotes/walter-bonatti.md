 - The mountains have rules. they are harsh rules, but they are there, and if you keep to them you are safe. A mountain is not like men. A mountain is sincere. The weapons to conquer it exist inside you, inside your soul.
 - Climbing is not a battle with the elements, nor against the law of gravity. It’s a battle against oneself.
 - I’ve always been incapable of accepting fate, and I’ve always refused to die, and that has helped me to survive.
 - If in normal conditions it is skill, which counts, in such extreme situations, it is the spirit, which saves.
 - I don’t deny that there can be an element of escapism in mountaineering, but this should never overshadow its real essence, which is not escape but victory over your own human frailty.
