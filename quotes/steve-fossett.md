 - The good thing about flying solo is it’s never boring.
 - Flying solo, you have a fair workload. I’m not only flying the balloon but doing the navigation, communications, repairing the burners, taking care of the equipment.
 - This is a Solo Flight, but I want aviation enthusiasts and adventurers everywhere to join me in the endeavour.
 - I was never comfortable with the risk of climbing in the Himalayas, or the amount of time in idleness that is involved in the Everest expedition.

 - I pick projects according to how fascinating they are to me, and it has resulted in a broad reach. My records are actually in five different sports: balloons, airplanes, airships, gliders, and sailboats.
