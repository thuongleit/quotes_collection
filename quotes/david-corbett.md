 - Characterization requires a constant back-and-forth between the exterior events of the story and the inner life of the character.
 - Compelling characters are not cogs in the machine of your plot; they are human beings to whom the story happens.
 - Whether we know it or not, our minds and hearts are populated by all the characters we will ever need â€“ though we may disassemble them and rearrange the parts into composites for variation.
 - An intuitive grasp of your character is formed by exploring scenes of profound emotional import-moments of overwhelming shame, joy, fear, pride, regret, forgiveness.
