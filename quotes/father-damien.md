 - Without the Blessed Sacrament a position like mine would be intolerable.
 - Turn all your thoughts and aspirations to heaven. Work hard to secure for yourself a place there for ever.
 - I would not be cured if the price of the cure was that I must leave the island and give up my work I am perfectly resigned to my lot. Do not feel sorry for me.
 - I make myself a leper with the lepers to gain all to Jesus Christ.
