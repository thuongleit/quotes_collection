 - Don’t ever put your happiness in someone else’s hands. They’ll drop it. They’ll drop it every time.
 - Sometimes you’ve got to be able to listen to yourself and be okay with no one else understanding.
 - Nothing is more real than the masks we make to show each other who we are.
 - The terrible thing about love is that it takes away your safety net, your balancing pole. Even the tightrope you walk upon will disappear beneath you, yet love expects you to keep walking anyway, arms outstretched, one foot after the other, on nothing more than air.
 - I tried. I tried to burn that memory of my regret. But I wasn’t dead yet, I was just on my way to dying, and it’s harder to burn memories when you’ve still got life left. When you’re alive you have to learn how to live with things like regret.
 - Real strength isn’t control. It’s knowing when to let go.
