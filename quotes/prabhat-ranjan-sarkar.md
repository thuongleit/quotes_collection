 - You are never alone or helpless. The force that guides the stars guides you too.
 - There is in the living being a thirst for limitlessness.
 - God is hidden inside us and everyone is looking for Him...

 - Suppose several boys are moving along a particular road and one boy falls into a drain, his dress and his body, become dirty. Other people, passers-by, will laugh at him, but when the boy’s father sees his boy in that condition, what is he to do? Will he laugh at his own son? No! What will he do?
