 - I never want anyone to be sitting where I’m sitting and to have lost their son, because I can never get Luke back.
 - This is about saving children’s lives. It is not about agencies and services protecting themselves.
 - Children have very little voice, and the coroner’s inquest is about Luke’s voice, and making sure Luke is heard and respected and honoured. I don’t want him to have died in vain.

 - What we have to continue to remind ourselves is that violence is a choice.
 - What I want people to take from this is that it isn’t simple. People judge you, people tell you what you should do. You do the best you can.
