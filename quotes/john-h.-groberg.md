 - Sometimes God calms the storm and sometimes He calms his child.
 - There is a connection between heaven and earth. Finding that connection gives meaning to everything, including death. Missing it makes everything meaningless, including life.
 - I further testify that when we eventually see things through the proper perspective of eternal truth, we will be amazed at how much we were blessed in important though often unperceived ways through keeping the Sabbath Day holy.
