 - People think that Detroit is this barren wasteland. While there are parts that are not as nice as others, the misconception is not true. It is definitely not a thriving community in Detroit, but it is getting there. There is a lot of heart and love in this city.
 - Whatever I lack in size and strength and speed, I kind of make up for in being grittier. When it comes to something like basketball I’m definitely not the best guy on the court, but I love elbowing and pushing people out or boxing them out.
 - I’m Korean-American. Not Colombian. My parents are first-generation, and I’m like in-between, because I moved over here when I was four or five.

 - I got to go to New York Comic-Con. I’ve never been and I’ve heard it’s crazy, so I’d love to see it. To be quite honest, I’d like for people to want us to be there, too. I’m hoping. I’m knocking on wood, so we’ll see.

 - What I learned, in the two months that we shot, I don’t think I could have learned in two to four years of drama school. It’s invaluable to me, and that’s been the most fun. It’s been nice to let this be a learning experience in everything.
 - I want to stretch myself. Another reason why I’m so fortunate is that this is a drama and I’ve been brought up in comedy.

 - I took up boxing to get in shape for filming because it’s grueling – all the running, the heat, the yelling, the crying that we do.
 - I’m not much of a horror fan. When it comes to ghost stuff and demon stuff, I can’t watch that.
 - Yeah, it’s scary. During filming, it wasn’t just jitters from being the newer guy there or the greenest guy there. It was also fear of not messing up such an important character.
 - The biggest challenges are in the same vein. It’s about retaining all that stuff. Also, the physical stuff is not as easy as we originally thought. I play a lot of sports and I remember saying, “Oh, I’ll be fine, running around or doing anything.”
 - Maybe it’s a cultural thing, being Korean, but my first reflex has always been to exude humility – but it doesn’t help you in acting. For acting, humility isn’t the best thing. It’ll weaken your work.
 - Maybe it was just me shorting myself to hedge my expectations. As a fan, I was excited about the project. If you look at the body of work for the people involved, I was excited about the project, but I didn’t really know. There were people saying, “I think we’re going to be part of something huge.”
 - I grew up in Michigan, so I played hockey, football and basketball. I played a little bit of lacrosse, too. My brother played more lacrosse and ran track.
 - At the end of the day, if you can’t say a line right, it does not matter who your contacts are.
 - I felt like I’ve needed to ask my parents up until about four years ago about everything. They have helped me tremendously, I came out of college with no debt. Everything they made, they just poured into my education.
 - Yeah, it’s been pretty gnarly. It’s fun. It can only be fun, unless you’re really squirmy about that. Honestly, during that guts episode, they didn’t tell Andrew and I anything. They just put trenchcoats on us and said, “All right, just stand right here and we’re going to put this stuff on you.”
 - Many people, not just Asians, are more concerned with hustling and getting to meetings with contacts to gain success.
 - I think there are fans who love the genre to begin with, and there are fans who love the comic book to begin with, but fans of the comic book aren’t necessarily fans of the genre. There are obviously a lot of those people who love both, but I’m not a huge fan of that genre, personally.
 - I’ve always loved drama. This is a blessing because I can show a little bit of what I can do, and hopefully more, in the future.
