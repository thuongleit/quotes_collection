 - The sharpest memory of our old-fashioned Christmas eve is my mother’s hand making sure I was settled in bed.
 - Verse is not written, it is bled; Out of the poet’s abstract head. Words drip the poem on the page; Out of his grief, delight and rage.

 - I wanted to write poetry almost a little more than I wanted to eat.
