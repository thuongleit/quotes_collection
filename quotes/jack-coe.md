 - Fear cannot stay in the same house as Jesus Christ.
 - If you have worry, you don’t have faith, and if you have faith, you don’t have worry.
 - Jesus can heal anything, anywhere, anytime, and anybody. All you have to do is put your faith in Him.
 - If you’ve got just a little bit of faith as a grain of mustard seed, and begin to praise God – that faith will mount up, until fear won’t be able to stay in your heart.
