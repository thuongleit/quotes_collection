 - I gave you the best of me.

 - I’d learned that some things are best kept secret.
 - Everyone is always going through tough things, the irony in it is that everyone thinks what they’re going through is just as hard as what you are. Life isn’t about surviving this, it’s about understanding this.
 - I’m sure you think that I don’t understand what you’re going through, but I do. It’s just that sometimes, our future is dictated by what we are, opposed to what we want.

 - When you know that someone close to you is going to die, there’s a natural tendency to want to spend as much time with them as you can.

 - Women want the fairytale. Not all women, of course, but most women grow up dreaming about the kind of man who would risk everything for them, even knowing they might get hurt.

 - It is the possibility that keeps me going, and though you may call me a dreamer or a fool or any other thing, I believe that anything is possible.
 - I finished your song, she said. Our last song. And I want to play it for you.
 - You have to promise you won’t fall in love with me.
 - Comfort and familiarity were wonderful but they also dulled passion and excitement. Predictability and habit made surprises almost impossible.
 - But most of all, I learned that it’s possible for two people to fall in love all over again, even when there’s been a lifetime of disappointment between them.
 - If hers are the stars in the nighttime sky, mine are the haunted empty spaces in between.
 - The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy.
 - Our souls were one, if you must know and never shall they be apart; with splendid dawn, your face aglow i reach for you and find my heart.
 - I love you, Katie. You might not be ready to say those words now, and maybe you’ll never be able to say them, but that doesn’t change how I feel about you.
 - She had been proud of his decision to serve his country, her heart bursting with love and admiration the first time she saw him outfitted in his dress blues.
 - It’ll be hard, but life moves fast-we’ll see each other again. I know that. I can feel that. Just like I can feel how much you care for me and how much I love you.
 - Change isn’t always for the best.
 - She leaned into me, and when I closed my eyes, I knew I wanted nothing more than to hold her this way forever.
 - Gossip is one thing, hurtful gossip is completely another, and even in high school we weren’t THAT mean.
 - Outside the hospital, I squinted in the harsh morning sunlight. I could hear birds chirping in the tree, but even though I searched for them, they remained hidden from me.
 - What happens if a car comes? We die.
 - I knew even then how rare that kind of love is. Only the luckiest people get to experience it at all.
 - Then you came along and helped me believe in myself again.
 - It was their secret, a secret meant for just the two of them, and she’d never been able to imagine how it would sound coming from someone else. But, somehow, Logan made it sound just right.
 - His voice, even now, follows me everywhere on this longest of rides, this thing called life.
 - I think that setting a novel in a small town taps into a sense of nostalgia among readers. People tend to believe life is different in small towns, and frankly, it is different.
 - Don’t let fear govern your decision.
 - Until you came along, I never knew how much I’d been missing. I never knew that a touch could be so meaningful or an expression so eloquent; I never knew that a kiss could literally take my breath awa.
 - What it’s like to be a parent: It’s one of the hardest things you’ll ever do but in exchange it teaches you the meaning of unconditional love.
 - Love is Love no matter old you are, and I knew if I gave you enough time, you’d come back to me.
 - Marriage is about compromise; it’s about doing something for the other person, even when you don’t want to.
 - You’ve gotten so caught up in being alone that you’re afraid of what might happen if you actually find someone else that can take you away from it.
 - Every couple has ups and downs, every couple argues, and that’s the thing – you’re a couple, and couples can’t function without trust.
 - We’re not the same people we were then. We’ve changed, we’ve grown.
 - It took me a long time to realize that distance can ruin even the best of intentions.
 - Miles: Well, things are kind of complicated right now. When you’re a grown-up, you’ll understand. Jonah: I don’t want to be a grown-up. Miles: Why not? Jonah: Because grown-ups always say that things are complicated.
 - But he had been in love once, that he knew. Once and only once, and a long time ago. And it had changed him forever. Perfect love did that to a person and this had been perfect.
 - You feel fine, and then, when your body can’t keep fighting, you don’t.
 - If he weren’t so damn cute, none of this would have happened.
 - Gifts of the heart can’t be claimed by anyone except the giver.
 - As I write, I am struggling with the ghost of someone I loved and lost. I now understand more fully the difficulties you were going through, and I realize how painful it must have been for you to move on.
 - Believe me, I’m no romantic, and while I’ve heard all about love at first sight, I’ve never believed in it, and I still don’t. But even so, there was something there, something recognizably real, and I couldn’t look away.
 - Love burns across the infinitude.
 - I met my wife on Spring break when I was in college. I was at the University of Notre Dame. She was at the University of New Hampshire. I bumped into her in Florida and told her the next day that I was going to marry her and 20 or something years later here we are.
 - Real people had real agendas, real demands, real expectations about how other people should behave.
 - What mattered most was knowing that love was mine to give, without strings or expectations.
 - A woman shaking in fear from demons in her mind, and the old man who loves her more deeply than life itself, crying softly in the corner, his face in his hands.
 - The past can be escaped only by embracing something better.
 - It all comes down to who is by your side and who is willing to stand up for love even when it seems impossible.
 - Truth only means something when it’s hard to admit.
 - Men are like that sometimes – if they meet someone and fall in love, it’s real, no matter how fast it happened. But if someone falls for a woman they happen to care about, all they do is question the man’s intentions.
 - I will never forget the vision of Jamie walking towards me.
 - Me. A bad boy. For eating boiled peanuts in the graveyard. Go figure.
 - It’s okay to be sad. Everyone gets sad now and then. Even me.
 - I realize the odds, and science, are against me. But science is not the total answer; this I know, this I have learned in my lifetime. And that leaves me with the belief that miracles, no matter how inexplicable or unbelievable, are real and can occur without regard to the natural order of things.
 - Makes sense to me. Sometimes starting over is exactly what a person needs. And I think it’s admirable. A lot of people don’t have the courage it takes to do something like that.
 - You are staring at me like you were going to eat me up.
 - Or maybe watching you enjoy a carefree summer while you fell in love was what kept me out of the hospital in the first place.
 - As far as I can tell, dumping soda on people is the equivalent of ‘Hi, it’s nice to meet you’ in this part of the world. Frankly, I think standard greetings work better, but what do I know?
 - And suddenly she knew exactly why Catherine had fallen in love with him. It wasn’t that he was unusually attractive, or ambitious, or even charming. He was partly those things, but more important, he seemed to live life on his own terms.
 - If you have no conflict, you have no story. That’s number one. That’s a rule of novels.
 - Consider yourself lucky for having met him, for he’s the kind of man who’ll prove you right.
 - Because being comfortable meant she might lower her guard, and she could not let that happen.
 - Why did you come here? To find you.
 - I write the things that I find most attractive in women. I like intelligence, I like passion – give me a little fire, be strong, don’t be wishy-washy, do the right thing.
 - All I know is that I fell in love with you, and I’ve never been more frightened about anything in my entire life.
 - I have no complaints about my path and the places it has taken me; enough complaints to fill a circus tent about other things, maybe, but the path I’ve chosen has always been the right one, and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.
 - I have always been a firm believer in God and the power of prayer, though to be honest, my faith has made for alist of questions I definitely want answered after I’m gone.
 - Stories are as unique as the people who tell them, and the best stories are in which the ending is a surprise.
 - It was easy to idealize someone you barely knew.
 - Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory, Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.
 - It might seem as the hardest thing to do, but you have to forget the guy who forgot about you.
 - I can’t live my life happily knowing you’re with someone else. That would kill a part of me. What we have is rare. it’s too beautiful to just throw it away.
 - The general rule is that my life is focused on the present, and very little on the past. If anything, I’m a little bit more focused toward the future.
 - The first thing I did when I sold my book was buy a new wedding ring for my wife and asked her to marry me all over again.
 - I know you loved her, but it’s okay to let it go now. You know that, don’t you? You’ve got to be able to let it go.
 - Some things were beyond understanding.
 - The pieces all fit together. Yet everything was falling apart.
 - Above all, a query letter is a sales pitch and it is the single most important page an unpublished writer will ever write. It’s the first impression and will either open the door or close it. It’s that important, so don’t mess it up. Mine took 17 drafts and two weeks to write.
 - You were honest and hardworking and kind. You were polite and patient and more mature than any guy I’d dated before. And when we were together, you listened in a way that made me feel like I was the only woman in the world. You made me feel complete and spending time with you just seemed right.
 - But most of all, what really attracted me to her was her manner. She laughed a lot, and it’s easy to fall for someone who can find humor in any situation. She was also intelligent, well read, and well spoken, willing to listen and confident in her beliefs. And most of all, she was warm.
 - In all my life, I’d never been as sure of anything, and as much as I hoped to one day hear Savannah say these words to me, what mattered most was knowing that love was mine to give, without strings or expectations.
 - They continued to watch each other from across the room, both frozen for a moment by the shadow of distant possibilities.
 - I think that enduring, committed love between a married couple, along with raising children, is the most noble act anyone can aspire to. It is not written about very much.
 - I’m sorry, I guess my company leaves a lot to be desired.
 - Frequency of sex – Women sometimes wanted; men always needed.
 - I would be rejected if I submitted any of my novels as romance novels.
 - If it makes you feel better, I promise to forget.
 - In another time and place, she might have felt differently, but thinking along those lines was pointless now.
 - And for the briefest instant, it almost feels like we’re together again.
 - When I was seventeen, I don’t think I even knew what love was. But when it’s right, it’s right, and you just know it.
 - He smiled, thinking that for just an instant, it was easy to imagine they were still married, both of them on the same team, both of them still in love. Except, of course, that they weren’t.
 - I know, but no matter what I choose I have to live with it. Forever. I have to be able to go forward and not look back anymore. Can you understand that?
 - Katie smiled and turned away, knowing it wasn’t an illusion or a figment of her imagination. She knew what she saw. She knew what she believed.
 - I have a great wife and it’s very easy to be romantic because it makes her happy and then my life is so much better when she’s happy.
 - For desert, maybe we can split a couple of crumbs.
 - More than anything, he wanted to return to the house with the same look of peace that he’d seen on Pastor Harris’s face, but he trudged through the sand, he couldn’t help feeling like an amateur, someone searching for God’s truths like a child searching for seashells.
 - Marriage is a partnership, not a democracy.
 - For them, it was nothing but an ordinary day on an ordinary day on an ordinary weekend, but for her, there was something revelatory about the notion that wonderful moments like these existed.
 - You gotta know when to be lazy. Done correctly, it’s an art form that benefits everyone.
 - We’d met at a carefree time, a moment full of promise, in its place now were the harsh lessons of the real world.
 - He thought of her often, and he missed the companionship they’d once shared and the friendship that had been the bedrock of their marriage at its best.
 - These days she simply did the best job she could, accepting the good with the bad.
 - The greater the love, the greater the tragedy when it’s over.
 - By the time she got back to work, the only thing Gabby knew for certain was that as forgiving as he’d been, she’d never live down what she’d done, and since there wasn’t a rock large enough to crawl under, it was in her best interest to find a way to avoid him.
 - It doesn’t sound so far-fetched, right? When two people love each other? While a part of me still wants to believe it’s possible, I know it’s not going to happen.
 - Denial is an ugly thing.
 - It’s hard at times, but it makes a kid strong in ways that most people can’t understand. Teaches them that even though people are left behind, new ones will inevitable take their place; that every place has something good – and bad – to offer. It makes a kid grow up fast.
 - I’ll be the light in the window.
 - That’s the thing about life. A lot of the time, it isn’t easy at all. We just have to try to make the best of it.
 - In the distance, he could see Molly lying in the tall grass off to the side of the house.
 - America was in full swing now, all the papers said so, and people were rushing forward, leaving behind the horrors of war. She understood the reasons, but they were rushing, like Lon, toward long hours and profits, neglecting the things that brought beauty to the world.
 - My first thoughts after waking are – and always have been – of you.
 - Tough toenails, tiger. What you want and what you get are usually two entirely different things.
 - I’ve been burdened by questions I’ve asked myself a thousand times since the last time we were together. Why did I do it? And would I do it again? It was I, you see, who ended it.
 - Love is the essence of a full and wonderful life.
 - How can I describe how much I love you? Is it even possible to describe a love like that? I don’t know, but as I sit here with pen in hand, I know that I have to try.
 - I’ve learned that memories can have a physical, almost living presence.
 - Focus in on the genre you want to write, and read books in that genre. A LOT of books by a variety of authors. And read with questions in your mind.
 - Stick two different people with two different sets of expectations under one roof and it ain’t always going to be shrimp and grits on Easter.
 - You are every reason, every hope and every dream I’ve ever had.
 - I found that as I flipped the days on the calendar, the worries I had about our relationship had began to diminish.
 - I steeled myself to focus only on the present yet remain alert to what might come next.
 - I love you, not just for now, but for always, and I dream of the day that you’ll take me in your arms again.
 - I read over a hundred books a year and have done so since I was fifteen years old, and every book I’ve read has taught me something.
 - Early on, he’d learned to enjoy simple things, things that couldn’t be bought, and he had a hard time understanding people who felt otherwise.
 - He was the kind of man everyone would fall in love with, even if they didn’t want to.
 - All of sudden, this shooting star went by, and all I could think was that they were listening to us somehow.
 - It would be like describing colors to someone blind from birth: The words might be understood, but the concept would remain mysterious and private.
 - I don’t want to live the rest of my life thinking about you and dreaming of what might have been. Stay with me, Allie.
 - Did you ever realize you have more opinions about my life than your own life?
 - I don’t know if spirits do indeed roam the world, but even if they do, I will sense your presence everywhere. When I listen to the ocean, it will be your whispers; when I see a dazzling sunset, it will be your image in the sky.
 - Even when we were standing in church and I was getting ready to take my vow I can remember wishing that you were standing there instead of him.
 - I was in love, and the feeling was even more wonderful than I ever imagined it could be.
 - She squeezed my hand, and I drew a shaky breath, marveling at the fact that while on an ordinary leave in an ordinary place, I’d somehow fallen in love with an extraordinary girl named Savannaah Lynn Curtis.
 - While wounds can be inflicted easily upon those we love, it’s often much more difficult to heal them.
 - Working on a novel is very solitary and I get to be the boss. I’m the dictator, so I win every battle. So, in that sense, novels are easier because you don’t have to answer to anyone. And then, you go into something like film and there are more cooks in the kitchen, so to speak.
 - It’s possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems.
 - At night, when I am alone, I call for you, and whenever my ache seems to be the greatest, you still seem to find a way to return to me.
 - It doesn’t matter to me whether I write in a man’s voice or a woman’s, or first or third person for that matter. Those choices come down to the story and I just go with it.
 - The romantics would call this a love story, the cynics would call it a tragedy. In my mind it’s a little bit of both, and no matter how you choose to view it in the end, it does not change the fact that it involves a great deal of my life and the path I’ve chosen to follow.
 - For nothing is more fulfilling than love itself.
 - It was inevitable for people to try to create a sense of normalcy in a place where nothing was normal. It helped one get through the day, to add predictability to a life that was inherently unpredictable.
 - It made perfect sense, and at the same time nothing seemed to.
 - I came to the conclusion that unrealized hopes, even small ones, were always wrenching.
 - There is a fine line I have to walk throughout the writing process in a novel. It is this line between drama and melodrama, and it is this line between evoking genuine emotional power and being manipulative.
 - As the warm air blew in the car, simple snapshots of the life they’d lived together surfaced in his mind; but as always, those images led inexorably to their final day together.
 - When you fall in love, love deeply. Be tough but also be open to the possibility of forgiveness.
 - It takes a long time to grow an old friend. Trust is built one single moment at a time.
 - I’m Catholic, and my wife is Catholic. We’re very religious. We go to church. We pray every night. We pray at dinner. To me, Catholics regard themselves as very Christian. Some Christians view Catholics as not necessarily Christian.
 - But because they didn’t see each other very often, their relationship had more ups and downs than either of them had experienced before. Since everything felt right when they were together, everything felt wrong when they weren’t.
 - Theresa, I know there’s a part of you that believes you can change someone, but the reality is that you can’t. You can change yourself, and Garrett can change himself, but you can’t do it for him.
 - I think that men know how to romance a woman and most do it well, at least for a time, otherwise women wouldn’t marry them. The problem is that most of them begin to rest on their laurels.
 - People are self-absorbed. I think that the mass ability of communication now probably allows individuals to meet more self-absorbed individuals. It has certainly changed the way that people meet.
 - In all love stories the theme is love and tragedy, so by writing these types of stories, I have to include tragedy.
 - I call it God Light, because it reminds me of heaven.
 - Finally getting control of myself, I kissed her again, then brought my hand to her face, gently running my fingers over her cheek. I marveled at the softness of her skin, the gentleness I saw in her eyes. Even now she was perfect.
 - As hard as it was, as terrible and unfair as the way things turned out, i wouldn’t have traded the few days i spent with him for anything.
 - I’m a novelist at heart. My sole intention is to write the best novel possible. I don’t think about the film potential at all.
 - I suppose more than anything, it’s the way of life in this part of the country that influences my writing. In Eastern North Carolina, with the exception of Wilmington, most people live in small towns.
 - Is it possible, I wonder, for a man to truly change? Or do character and habit form the immovable boundaries of our lives?
 - It’s the same thing. Passion is passion. It’s the excitement between the tedious spaces, and it doesn’t matter where it’s directed.
 - The most ordinary things could be made extraordinary.
 - One of the things I’ve learned in my life is that sometimes you’ve got to take a chance.
 - He was the toast to her butter.
 - Men like women who know how to be subtle.
 - If pinpointing God’s presence were really that simple, then he supposed the beaches would be more crowded in the mornings. They would be filled with people on their own quests, instead of people jogging or walking their dogs or fishing in the surf.
 - Man and wife were supposed to stay together because they’d made their vows in front of God and family.
 - I suddenly understood that even love and caring weren’t always enough. They were the concrete bricks of our relationship, but unstable without the mortar of time spent together, time without the threat of imminent separation hanging over us.
 - Say I’m a bird.
 - If you’re going to sit on someone’s tombstone, you might as well know something about them, right?
 - I wanted to write a story that was different than what I’ve done before – so I decided to write dual love stories that will keep the reader wondering how the stories will come together by the end.
 - The search for God’s presence was much of a mystery as God himself, and what was God if not a mystery?
 - I realized that there were times when we talked not because we needed to communicate anything important, but simply because we each drew comfort from the other’s voice.
 - I personally think that most people, most of the time, do the right thing. I just believe this. Otherwise, the world would be chaos, and it’s not.
 - But no matter what was going on in our lives, I could imagine lying beside her in bed at the end of the day, holding her while we talked and laughed, lost in each other’s arms.
 - It’s hard for me to talk to her. All I can do when I look at her is think about the day when I won’t be able to. So I spend all my time at school thinking about her, wishing I could see her right then, but when I get to her house, I don’t know what to say.
 - People were destined for one another; that’s the romantic idea that young girls have, and I guess part of me still believes it.
 - It’s easy to write something average or even something good. But writing well is quite challenging.
 - I suppose I’m most influenced by any good, commercial writer. I learn from everyone.
 - That’s the thing about life, he knew. There was always a but.
 - People didn’t change. they liked what they liked even if they didn’t understand why.
 - As a girl, she had come to believe in the ideal man – the prince or knight of her childhood stories. In the real world, however, men like that simply didn’t exist.
 - Dean: If there is a greater power, why is it he can’t get you a new sweater? Jamie: Because, he’s too busy looking for your brain.
 - If I knew where creativity came from, I’d probably be a lot less stressed about coming up with new stories.
 - I write 2,000 words a day when I write. It sometimes takes three hours, it sometimes takes five hours.
 - Where does a story truly begin? In life, there are seldom clear-cut beginnings, those moments when we can, in looking back, say that everything started. Yet there are moments when fate intersects with our daily lives, setting in motion a sequence of events whose outcome we could never have foreseen.
 - I’d like to be remembered not only for my body of work but also for specific novels. Ideally, I want to be remembered in the same way as Stephen King, who defined and exemplified excellence in the horror genre in the late 20th and early 21st century.
 - The inspiration for my novels comes from the depths of a creative well, based on asking myself questions over and over. I try to write something different each time I sit down to write; I try to surprise the readers.
 - If I tried to write long-hand, I suppose I’d never finish a novel. I edit too much as I write – the paper would be “white-out” and sharpie marks. Writing with a computer works for me, so I stick with it.
 - Each recognized the fact that real commitment could be proven only through the passage of time.
 - I have seldom been described as shy.
 - Good and bad, strengths and faults, he was hers forever.
 - People want to believe that every marriage is perfect balance but it isn’t. One person always loves more deeply than the other.
 - It’s probably not going to lead to anything. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t try. If everyone who thought they might fail didn’t even try, where would we be today?
 - On the drive we talked easily, but we did make a small detour. After pulling into a rest stop, we made out like teenagers.
 - By making the place and the people and the feelings real, by the time someone closes the cover of one of my books, they have, hopefully, felt all of the emotions of life.
 - I’ve learned that we’re all entitled to have our secrets.
 - What the younger generation didn’t understand was that the grass was greenest where it’s watered...
 - He liked her; it was as simple as that.
 - Being around someone who accepts and supports you will remind you to accept and support yourself.
 - If you discovered something that made you tighten inside, you had better try to learn more about it.
 - There are always differences when you adapt a novel to a film. A novel is longer so you’re automatically cutting out elements and introspection but this is actually a film that stays very close to the novel.
 - That’s my sweetheart in there. I’m not living her. This is my home now. Your mother is my home.
 - That’s the thing about being the product of happily marries parents, You grow up thinking the fairy tale is real, and more than that, you think you’re entitled to live it. So far, though, it wasn’t working out as planned.
 - I might kiss you. I might be bad at it. That’s not possible.
 - Find out who you are, and do it on purpose.
 - Books and movies inspire me, but I do my best to keep my stories as original as possible.
 - I’m a novelist at heart. How’s that? And that’s how I make my living, is I write novels.
 - When people cared about each other, they always found a way to make it work.
 - None of my characters are rich or famous, and the situations they find themselves in could happen to anyone.
 - Life, he decided, was for living, not for having, and he wanted to experience every moment that he could.
 - When I am in the process of conceiving a story, I make sure it can be told with words and pictures. The story has to be creative, original and interesting in both areas. Many stories get rejected because they feel derivative.
 - As Logan walked towards her, he smiled as if reading her mind and opened his arms.
 - There’s nothing you can tell me that will change how I feel about you. Nothing. Because that isn’t you. It’s never been you. You’re the woman I’ve come to know. The woman I love.
 - She’d preferred the uncertainty, if only because it allowed her to remember him the way he used to be. Sometimes, though, she wondered what he felt when he thought of that year they spent together, or if he ever marveled at what they’d shared, or even whether he thought of her at all.
 - I just tell people what they already know, but are afraid to admit to themselves.
 - In this world that we live in we have originality in literature, but we also have TV and movies. I write love stories. I could never write a love story based on the Titanic – that was never a novel. If I see an idea that’s been done in film, I try to avoid that.
 - I’ll admit that it’s not easy to get an agent, but becoming successful in anything requires perseverance.
 - I know we loved each other, but distance can do strange things to people and before I was willing to tell you about it, I wanted to be certain that it would last.
 - Love is a gift. You give love and that’s where the joy is.
 - Admittedly, there was a lot she still didn’t know about him, but she did know this: He completed her in a way that she’d never thought possible. Knowledge isn’t everything, she told herself, and she knew then that, in Nana’s words, he was the toast to her butter.
 - A moment later, he plopped down on the sand beside her, and when they accidentally touched, Gabby had the briefest flash of them sitting together just like this on a hundred different weekends in the future.
 - Yet I have come to believe that while the past is unchangeable, our perceptions of is are malleable...
 - A good marriage, like any partnership, meant subordinating one’s own needs to that of the other’s, in the expectation that the other will do the same.
 - Proximity bred familiarity, and familiarity bred comfort.
 - But a risk-free life wasn’t much of a life, really, and if she was going to change, she might as well start now.
 - I have some art, but I am a hobbyist. I would not consider myself an expert but in the course of writing this novel I became very familiar with the various movements in American Modern Art from 1900 onwards.
 - There are things that happen that change the course of people’s lives, but it’s a function of everybody’s lives.
 - In the end, you really want to make the best film that you can, and in the reality of the filmmaking world, you have things like budgets.
 - Believe it or not, that was the first time I recognized that in some ways she was just like the rest of us.
 - I don’t write romance novels.
 - I don’t write fantasy, I write reality. Also, my novels have roots to Greek tragedies and as such, there has to be tragedy.
 - It was one thing to divide the major assets, but how was it possible to divide the heart?
 - Publishing is a business. Writing may be art, but publishing, when all is said and done, comes down to dollars.
 - In the end, for me, the sole single goal is to write the best novel that I can. Whether or not it gets made or gets purchased.
 - Frugality, I’ve learned, has its own cost, one that sometimes lasts forever.
 - The movies are fun, but I’m a novelist. In many ways, screenwriting is much easier than writing novels. I find screenplays twenty times easier to write than a novel.
 - There’s always pressure, a great deal of pressure, when writing, since my first books were so successful.
 - I wouldn’t go that far. But I know my way around the kitchen. I make dinner every night.
 - I know it can’t be the same between us, but that doesn’t change the way I felt about you then.
 - Because in the end, and no matter how hard it is, acceptance helps people move on with the rest of their lives.
 - If people don’t like you, or they think you’re strange, then that’s their problem.
 - My wife, my family, my friends – they’ve all taught me things about love and what that emotion really means. In a nutshell, loving someone is about giving, not receiving.
 - I’ve done a number of films. I’ve been around this. I think the biggest challenge is just getting the script right, the way that you want the script to be. It’s really about capturing the complexity of emotions and creating the kind of characters that people will want to watch every week.
 - What I try to do with any of my stories, any of my novels, is make them feel very original.
 - A joy as intense as pain.
 - It was a lesson that I would learn in time though it wasn’t Hegbert who taught me.
 - You were the best friend I ever had, Allie. I’d still like to be friends, even if you are engaged, and even if it is just for a couple of days.
