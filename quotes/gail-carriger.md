 - Ivy Hisselpenny was the unfortunate victim of circumstances that dictated she be only-just-pretty, only-just-wealthy, and possessed of a terrible propensity for wearing extremely silly hats.

 - She moved with such purpose it was as though she walked with exclamation marks.
 - You are about as covert as a sledgehammer.
 - The ill-informed masses included her own family among their ranks, a family that specialized in being both inconvenient and asinine.
 - Why Alexia that is quite beautiful. It does ot reflect your customary taste at all approved Miss Hisselpenny with glee. Trust Ivy to like the hideous thing for it’s looks.
 - Who doesn’t want an exploding wicker chicken?
 - Lady Maccon cogitated. She would like to encourage this new spirit of social-mindedness. If Felicity needed anything in her life, it was a cause. Then she might stop nitpicking everyone else.
 - Lord Akeldama did so love to know all the gossip about the mundane world, but it was in the manner of a cat amusing himself among the butterflies without a need to interfere should their wings get torn off. They were only butterflies, after all.

 - No one ever explained the octopuses.
 - A man was attacking me with a wet handkerchief.

 - As if being a former vampire drone in a werewolf household were not shocking enough, the maid then opened her mouth and proved that she was also, quite reprehensibly, French.
 - How ghastly for her, people actually thinking, with their brains, and right next door. Oh, the travesty of it all.

 - No, Lord Maccon was riproaring, tumble down, without a doubt, pickled beyond the gherkin.
 - There are words to describe her, my dear, but one does not repeat them in polite company.

 - And I find perfect beauty excessively boring, don’t you?
 - Alexia blinked stupidly at the Beta from around the earl’s upper arm. Her heart was doing crazy things, and she still could not locate her kneecaps. She took a deep breath and put some serious attention into tracking them down.

 - Acknowledgements With grateful thanks to the three least-appreciated and hardest-working proselytizers of the written word: independent bookstores, librarians, and teachers.

 - His eyes were jet-colored circles of perpetual disapproval.
 - I believe there is a considerable range in the bang of most guns.

 - Lord Maccon, being Lord Maccon and good at such things, then changed, right there in the Thames, from dog-paddling wolf to large man treading water. He did so flawlessly, so that his head never went under the water. Professor Lyall suspected him of practicing such maneuvers in the bathtub.
 - Lyall understood a broken heart, but it could not be allowed to rumple perfectly good shirtwaists.
 - She had to give her teachers credit: they were right to insist all pupils carry scissors, handkerchiefs, perfume and hair ribbons at all times. At some point she’d learn why they also required a red lace doily and a lemon.

 - I am rather fond of ladybugs. They are so delightfully hemispherical.
 - Scotsmen, she had occasion to observe, often did have nice knees. Perhaps that was why they insisted upon kilts.
