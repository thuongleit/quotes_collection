 - Our achievements of today are but the sum total of our thoughts of yesterday.
 - Knowing God without knowing our own wretchedness makes for pride. Knowing our own wretchedness without knowing God makes for despair. Knowing Jesus Christ strikes the balance because he shows us both God and our own wretchedness.
 - We know the truth not only through our reason but also through our heart. It is through the latter that we know first principles, and reason, which has nothing to do with it, tries in vain to refute them.

 - We sail within a vast sphere, ever drifting in uncertainty, driven from end to end.

 - Silence is the greatest persecution; never do the saints keep themselves silent.
 - When everyone is moving towards depravity, no one seems to be moving, but if someone stops he shows up the others who are rushing on, by acting as a fixed point.
 - Time heals griefs and quarrels, for we change and are no longer the same persons. Neither the offender nor the offended are any more themselves.
 - Eloquence is a painting of thought; and thus those who, after having painted it, add something more, make a picture instead of a portrait.

 - We never live, but we hope to live; and as we are always arranging to be happy, it must be that we never are so.

 - There are two equally dangerous extremes-to shut reason out, and to let nothing else in.
 - This is what I see, and what troubles me. I look on all sides, and everywhere I see nothing but obscurity. Nature offers me nothing that is not a matter of doubt and disquiet.
 - Each man is everything to himself, for with his death everything is dead for him. That is why each of us thinks he is everything to everyone. We must not judge nature by ourselves, but by its own standards.
 - How comes it that a cripple does not offend us, but a fool does? Because a cripple recognizes that we walk straight, whereas a fool declares that it is we who are silly; if it were not so, we should feel pity and not anger.

 - Habit is the second nature which destroys the first.
 - Unable to make what is just strong, we have made what is strong just.
 - Faith is a sounder guide than reason. Reason can only go so far, but faith has no limits.

 - All the trouble in the world is due to the fact that man cannot sit still in a room.
 - The best defense against logic is ignorance.
 - Put the world’s greatest philosopher on a plank that is wider than need be; if there is a precipe below, although his reason may convince him that he is safe, his imagination will prevail.

 - Law, without force, is impotent.
 - The sensitivity of men to small matters, and their indifference to great ones, indicates a strange inversion.

 - The married should not forget that to speak of love begets love.
 - Little things console us because little things afflict us.
 - Perfect clarity would profit the intellect but damage the will.
 - Justice is as much a matter of fashion as charm is.
 - Mutual cheating is the foundation of society.
 - Let us weigh the gain and the loss, in wagering that God is. Consider these alternatives: if you win, you win all, if you lose you lose nothing. Do not hesitate, then, to wager that he is.
 - Concupiscence and force are the source of all our actions; concupiscence causes voluntary actions, force involuntary ones.
 - The greatness of man is great in that he knows himself to be wretched. A tree does not know itself to be wretched.
 - Our soul is cast into a body, where it finds number, time, dimension. Thereupon it reasons, and calls this nature necessity, and can believe nothing else.
 - Any unity which doesn’t have its origin in the multitudes is tyranny.
 - Reflect on death as in Jesus Christ, not as without Jesus Christ. Without Jesus Christ it is dreadful, it is alarming, it is the terror of nature. In Jesus Christ it is fair and lovely, it is good and holy, it is the joy of saints.
 - When we wish to correct with advantage, and to show another that he errs, we must notice from what side he views the matter, for on that side it is usually true.
 - When we see a natural style, we are astonished and charmed; for we expected to see an author, and we find a person.
 - All our life passes in this way: we seek rest by struggling against certain obstacles, and once they are overcome, rest proves intolerable because of the boredom it produces.
 - There is nothing that we can see on earth which does not either show the wretchedness of man or the mercy of God. One either sees the powerlessness of man without God, or the strength of man with God.

 - If ignorance were bliss, he’d be a blister.
 - Flies are so mighty that they win battles, paralyse our minds, eat up our bodies.

 - If our condition were truly happy, we would not seek diversion from it in order to make ourselves happy.
 - It is not from space that I must seek my dignity, but from the government of my thought. I shall have no more if I possess worlds. By space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom; by thought I comprehend the world.
 - We are fools to depend upon the society of our fellow-men. Wretched as we are, powerless as we are, they will not aid us; we shall die alone.
 - Human life is thus only an endless illusion. Men deceive and flatter each other. No one speaks of us in our presence as he does when we are gone. Society is based on mutual hypocrisy.
 - To go beyond the bounds of moderation is to outrage humanity. The greatness of the human soul is shown by knowing how to keep within proper bounds. There are two equally dangerous extremes- to shut reason out, and not to let nothing in.
 - There are two kinds of people one can call reasonable: those who serve God with all their heart because they know him, and those who seek him with all their heart because they do not know him.

 - There was once in man a true happiness of which there now remain to him only the mark and empty trace, which he in vain tries to fill from all his surroundings, seeking from things absent the help he does not obtain in things present.
 - Description of man: dependence, longing for independence, need.
 - One of the greatest artifices the devil uses to engage men in vice and debauchery, is to fasten names of contempt on certain virtues, and thus fill weak souls with a foolish fear of passing for scrupulous, should they desire to put them in practice.
 - The gospel to me is simply irresistible.

 - What a vast difference there is between knowing God and loving Him.
 - It is not possible to have reasonable grounds for not believing in miracles.

 - Imagination is the deceptive part in man, the mistress of error and falsehood.
 - Montaigne is wrong in declaring that custom ought to be followed simply because it is custom, and not because it is reasonable or just.
 - We feel neither extreme heat nor extreme cold; qualities that are in excess are so much at variance with our feelings that they are impalpable: we do not feel them, though we suffer from their effects.
 - You corrupt religion either in favour of your friends, or against your enemies.
 - To deny, to believe, and to doubt well are to a man as the race is to a horse.
 - Without Jesus Christ man must be in vice and misery with Jesus Christ man is free from vice and misery in Him is all our virtue and all our happiness. Apart from Him there is but vice, misery, darkness, death, despair.

 - It is not in Montaigne, but in myself, that I find all that I see in him.
 - It is a dangerous experiment to call in gratitude as an ally to love. Love is a debt which inclination always pays, obligation never.
 - Nothing is so important to man as his own state; nothing is so formidable to him as eternity. And thus it is unnatural that thereshould be men indifferent to the loss of their existence and to the perils of everlasting suffering.
 - We implore the mercy of God, not that He may leave us at peace in our vices, but that He may deliver us from them.
 - Curiosity is nothing more than vanity. More often than not we only seek knowledge to show it off.
 - Is it courage in a dying man to go, in weakness and in agony, to affront an almighty and eternal God?
 - Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.
 - Happiness can be found neither in ourselves nor in external things, but in God and in ourselves as united to him.

 - What amazes me the most is to see that everyone is not amazed at his own weakness.
 - Le silence est la plus grande perse cution: jamais les saints ne se sont tus. Silence is the greatest of all persecutions: no saint was ever silent.

 - Equality of possessions is no doubt right, but, as men could not make might obey right, they have made right obey might.
 - Necessity, that great refuge and excuse for human frailty, breaks through all law; and he is not to be accounted in fault whose crime is not the effect of choice, but force.

 - The war existing between the senses and reason.
 - It is incomprehensible that God should exist, and it is incomprehensible that he should not exist.
 - The finite is annihilated in the presence of the infinite, and becomes a pure nothing. So our spirit before God, so our justice before divine justice.

 - How hollow is the heart of man, and how full of excrement!
 - The manner in which Epictetus, Montaigne, and Salomon de Tultie wrote, is the most usual, the most suggestive, the most remembered, and the oftener quoted; because it is entirely composed of thoughts born from the common talk of life.

 - Unless we love the truth we cannot know it.
 - Vanity is but the surface.
