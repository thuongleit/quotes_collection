 - When Germany and England and America will long have lost their present identity or purpose, we shall still be strong in ours.
 - You have your way of life, we ours. In your system of life we are essentially without ‘honor.’ In our system of life you are essentially without morality. In your system of life we must forever appear graceless; to us you must forever appear godless.
 - We Jews, we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers. Nothing you can do will meet our demands and needs. We will forever destroy because we want a world of our own.
 - Wherever the Jew is found he is a problem, a source of unhappiness to himself and to those around him. Ever since he has been scattered in your midst he has had to maintain a continuous struggle for the conservation of his identity.
 - You may even have Jews in your midst who did not learn their way of life from us, and did not inherit it from a Jewish forebear. We may have authentic gentiles in our midst: these single protests are of no account; they are extreme and irrelevant variations.
 - Our Jewishness is not a creed, it is ourself, our totality. Indeed, it may be fairly said that the surest evidence of your lack of seriousness in religion is the fact that your religions are not national, that you are not compromised and dedicated, en masse, to the faith.
 - We belong to the One mastering God: you belong to the republic of playful gods.
 - In the heart of any pious Jew, God is a Jew. Is your God an Englishman or an American?
