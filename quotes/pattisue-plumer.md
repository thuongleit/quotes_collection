 - Running teaches us that we are capable of so much more than we ever imagined.
 - Racing teaches us to challenge ourselves. It teaches us to push beyond where we thought we could go. It helps us to find out what we are made of. This is what we do. This is what it’s all about.
 - Workouts are like brushing my teeth; I don’t think about them, I just do them. The decision has already been made.
