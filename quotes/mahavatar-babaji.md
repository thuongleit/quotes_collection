 - Love is the undisturbed balance that binds this universe together.
 - If you come to doubt, I’ll give you every reason to doubt. If you come suspicious, I’ll give you every reason to be suspicious. But if you come seeking Love, I’ll show you more love than you’ve ever known.
 - The Divine realm extends to the earthly; but the later, illusory in nature, does not contain the essence of Reality.
 - Even in the world, the yogi who faithfully discharges his responsibilities, without personal motive or attachment, treads the sure path of enlightenment.
