 - Everyone’s life is a train wreck. Your life happens to be a high-class train wreck.
 - You know, my hair is very upsetting to people, but it’s upsetting on purpose. It is important to look old so that the young will not be afraid of dying. People don’t like old women. We don’t honor age in our society, and we certainly don’t honor it in Hollywood.
 - A critic is someone who never actually goes to the battle, yet who afterwards comes out shooting the wounded.
 - I don’t have a waist: I’m a breadbox on top of legs.
 - I think the 20s are a vastly overrated decade. We promise kids that once they get out of school, life will begin and their dreams will come true. But then comes the struggle.
 - Love is as strict as acting. If you want to love somebody, stand there and do it. If you don’t, don’t. There are no other choices.
 - Women are usually only interesting to studio executives when they are fecund, between the ages of 15 and 30. I decided to get through the really tough patch, around 50, by just cutting my price and playing ten years older. I didn’t want to have to wait until I was an old lady to play one.
 - I am a greedy actor in the sense that I like the big bites. Put a big fat steak in front of me, and I will eat it.

 - I’m interested in playing old ladies because I am becoming one. And I want to become a very good one!
 - I don’t take part in texting and those other things myself, so I don’t really know if people put as much thought into messaging as they used to into writing letters.
 - I’m not glamorous, I don’t have a look, I don’t know anything about opera, I have no Italian, and I’m too old.
 - I’m sorry I didn’t wear paint this morning. I tend not to wear it unless I’m getting highly paid.
 - Both my parents were actors. I was schooled to think that acting was an important social service, that it was something that human beings need.
 - I was raised to be in service to something larger than myself. A lot of actors concentrate on what they will get out of the profession, rather than what they can offer it. The way I see it, if you come with something to offer, you can offer it forever.
 - The director’s job is full of all sorts of annoyances and details – like how many cars are on the street. Ugh. I don’t want it. I like my gig. And I feel that for the next 30 years or so I can keep learning more about it.
