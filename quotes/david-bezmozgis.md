 - Language is a personality as well. People are different when they speak different languages.
 - When you write a book, you want to have fidelity to the character. Characters and their emotions guide the structure of the novel.
 - When writing dialogue, I hear it in both Russian and English, and try to find a language that combines the two.
 - There are books like Darkness at Noon, which from the prose standpoint I don’t think is a perfect book. It has flaws. But for its time, it was very politically courageous.
 - Writing a novel, in an unplanned and unpredictable way, makes you engaged; it takes you into yourself, and it becomes something between you and the character for a moment, and then you move back into the structure of the book. I love those moments, because they are completely unbidden.
 - There are different types of readers. People draw lines at which three things intersect: the character, the author, and the reader.
 - We all have some ideological quotient in ourselves. And I think it does guide who we are.
 - I think ex-Soviet or Russian-Jewish women are tougher and that comes through. And if they are more pragmatic than the men, it’s because they are obliged to be. They have all the female responsibilities and all the male responsibilities.
