 - Human contribution is the essential ingredient. It is only in the giving of oneself to others that we truly live.
 - Such to me is the new image of aging; growth in self, and service for all mankind.
 - We are born into this world with clenched fists, we leave it with fingers apart- preaching the lesson that you take nothing with you.
 - What I spent, is gone; what I kept, I lost; but what I gave away will be mine forever.
