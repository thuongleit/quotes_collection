 - The willingness to take risks is our grasp of faith.
 - The poet craves emotion, and feeds the fire that consumes him, and only under this condition is he baptized with creative power.
 - The language of literature is the language of all the world. It is necessary to divest ourselves at once of the notion of diversified vocal and grammatical speech which constitutes the various tongues of the Earth, and conceals the identity of image and logic in the minds of all men.

 - Agitation is that part of our intellectual life where vitality results; there ideas are born, breed and bring forth.
 - Seasonal changes, as it were, take place in history, when there is practically an almost universal death, a falling of the foliage of the tree of life. Such were the intervals between the ancient and mediaeval time, the mediaeval and the modern.
 - It is not meant that the artist, in arriving at truth, must follow the way of the scientist, or, in stating it, the way of the philosopher.
