 - When we serve the poor and the sick we serve Jesus. We must not fail to help our neighbors, because in them we serve Jesus.
 - Apart from the cross, there is no other ladder by which we may get to heaven.
 - Without the burden of afflictions it is impossible to reach the height of Grace. The gift of Grace increases as the struggle increases.
 - The gifts of grace increase as the sorrows increase.
