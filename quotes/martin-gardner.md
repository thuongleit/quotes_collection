 - The universe is almost like a huge magic trick and scientists are trying to figure out how it does what it does.
 - Mathematics is not only real, but it is the only reality.
 - The sudden hunch, the creative leap of mind that “sees” in a flash how to solve a problem in a simple way, is something quite different from general intelligence.
 - In no other branch of mathematics is it so easy for experts to blunder as in probability theory.
 - Mathemagical mathematics combines the beauty of mathematical structure with the entertainment value of a trick.
 - Debunking bad science should be constant obligation of the science community, even if it takes time away from serious research or seems to be a losing battle. One takes comfort from the fact there is no Gresham’s laws in science. In the long run, good science drives out bad.
 - The last level of metaphor in the Alice books is this: that life, viewed rationally and without illusion, appears to be a nonsense tale told by an idiot mathematician.
 - As Bertrand Russell once wrote, two plus two is four even in the interior of the sun.
 - The violence and double-talk in the Alice books probably does no harm to children, but the novels should not be allowed to circulate indiscriminately among adults who are undergoing analysis.
 - There is still a difference between something and nothing, but it is purely geometrical and there is nothing behind the geometry.
 - A surprising proportion of mathematicians are accomplished musicians. Is it because music and mathematics share patterns that are beautiful?
 - As I have often said, electrons and gerbils don’t cheat. People do.
 - One would be hard put to find a set of whole numbers with a more fascinating history and more elegant properties surrounded by greater depths of mystery – and more totally useless – than the perfect numbers.
 - If all sentient beings in the universe disappeared, there would remain a sense in which mathematical objects and theorems would continue to exist even though there would be no one around to write or talk about them. Huge prime numbers would continue to be prime, even if no one had proved them prime.
 - If God creates a world of particles and waves, dancing in obedience to mathematical and physical laws, who are we to say that he cannot make use of those laws to cover the surface of a small planet with living creatures?
 - A god whose creation is so imperfect that he must be continually adjusting it to make it work properly seems to me a god of relatively low order, hardly worthy of any worship.
 - In many cases a dull proof can be supplemented by a geometric analogue so simple and beautiful that the truth of a theorem is almost seen at a glance.
 - The computers are not replacing mathematicians; they are breeding them.
 - Modern science should indeed arouse in all of us a humility before the immensity of the unexplored and a tolerance for crazy hypotheses.
 - Indeed, there is something to be said for the old math when taught by a poorly trained teacher. He can, at least, get across the fundamental rules of calculation without too much confusion. The same teacher trying to teach new math is apt to get across nothing at all...
 - Although Lewis Carroll thought of The Hunting of the Snark as a nonsense ballad for children, it is hard to imagine – in fact one shudders to imagine – a child of today reading and enjoying it.
