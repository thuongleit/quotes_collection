 - The artist should fear to become the slave of detail. He should strive to express his thought and not the surface of it. What avails a storm cloud accurate in form and color if the storm is not therein?
 - The artist has only to remain true to his dream and it will possess his work in such a manner that it will resemble the work of no other man.
 - Imitation is not inspiration, and inspiration only can give birth to a work of art. The least of man’s original emanation is better than the best of borrowed thought.
 - The artist needs but a roof, a crust of bread, and his easel, and all the rest God gives him in abundance. He must live to paint and not paint to live.
 - A rain-tight roof, frugal living, a box of colors, and God’s sunlight through clear windows keep the soul attuned and the body vigorous for one’s daily work.
 - What avails a storm cloud accurate in form and color if the storm is not therein?
 - The artist should strive to express his thought and not the surface of it.
 - The new is not revealed to those whose eyse are fastened in worship upon the old.
