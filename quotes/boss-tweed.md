 - The way to have power is to take it.
 - Stop them damn pictures! I don’t care what the papers write about me. My constituents can’t read. But, damn it, they can see the pictures!
 - The appearance of the law must be upheld – especially when it’s being broken.
 - I don’t care a straw for your newspaper articles, my constituents don’t know how to read, but they can’t help seeing them damned pictures.
 - As long as I count the votes, what are you going to do about it?
 - I don’t care who does the electing, as long as I get to do the nominating.
