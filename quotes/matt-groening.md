 - The entire world of grown-ups is corrupt and stupid.
 - Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix.
 - Living creatively is really important to maintain throughout your life. And living creatively doesn’t mean only artistic creativity, although that’s part of it. It means being yourself, not just complying with the wishes of other people.
 - Today is the first day of the rest of your short, brutish existence as a sentient creature before being snuffed out into utter nothingness for all eternity.
 - Being a good embalmer is a thankless job.
 - Nihilism in American comedy came along way before ‘The Simpsons.’ There was a fairly nihilistic point of view to ‘Saturday Night Live,’ for instance, back in the beginning, and a lot of really dark comedy had a really anti-sentimental take on life.
 - I basically drew my own family. My father’s name is Homer. My mother’s name is Margaret. I have a sister Lisa and another sister Maggie, so I drew all of them. I was going to name the main character Matt, but I didn’t think it would go over well in a pitch meeting, so I changed the name to Bart.
 - You should listen to your heart, and not the voices in your head.
 - I’m a level 5 vegan, I don’t eat anything that casts a shadow.

 - I’ll keep it short and sweet – Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.
 - With ‘Futurama,’ I wanted to do unrequited love, and David Cohen agreed, and although our original plan was never to have Fry and Leela get together, we finally just said, ‘You can only string the fans along so far.’
 - Back in high school, I wrote a novel about a character named Bart Simpson. I thought it was a very unusual name for a kid at the time. I had this idea of an angry father yelling ‘Bart,’ and Bart sounds kind of like bark – like a barking dog.
 - My standard comment is, ‘If you don’t want your kids to be like Bart Simpson, don’t act like Homer Simpson.’
 - Fans think they want to see more than the 10 to 20 seconds of Itchy and Scratchy that we put on the show, but my feeling is less is more. Once you’ve skinned and flayed a cat, ripped his head off, made him drink acid and tied his tongue to the moon, there really isn’t that much to say.
 - Families are about love overcoming emotional torture.
 - A woman knows all about her children. She knows about dentist appointments, soccer games, romances, best friends, location of friend’s houses, favorite foods, secret fears and hopes and dreams. A man is vaguely aware of some short people living in the house.
 - I plead alignment to the flakes of the untitled snakes of a merry cow and to the republicrats for which they scam: one nacho, underpants with licorice and jugs of wine for owls.

 - If I have one technology tip of the day, it’s this: No matter how good the video on YouTube is, don’t read the comments, just don’t, because it will make you hate all humans.
 - I went to Bali, and I was in a small village, and somebody who was with me showed a woman a little figurine of Bart and asked: ‘Do you know who this is?’ And she said: ‘Mickey Mouse.’
 - I draw a weekly comic strip called Life in Hell, which is syndicated in about 250 newspapers. That’s what I did before The Simpsons, and what I plan to do for the rest of my life.
 - If people only knew how much I secretly hated them, they’d love me for holding it in.
 - I don’t have to be careful, I’ve got a gun.
 - Humor does depend on surprise, and the things that people remember as the funniest things in the world, you look at later and you go, “What? What was that all about?”
 - Your cable television is experiencing difficulties. Please do not panic. Resist the temptation to read or talk to loved ones. Do not attempt sexual relations, as years of TV radiation have left your genitals withered and useless.
 - I judge my life by how miserable it used to be. If I could pay my rent, I was deliriously happy. Now I’m deliriously happy all the time.
 - The thing that makes me happiest about Simpsons Illustrated are all the drawings that we get from readers. I wish we could print them all. They’re really imaginative. They show a lot of hard work.
 - Part of the fun of being alive is knowing that you’re annoying the hell out of someone else.
 - The conundrum that I face on a daily basis is that I have two sons who have grown up watching ‘The Simpsons,’ so they know exactly what buttons to push. They know how Bart irritates Homer, and they use these lines against me to tell me that I’m not funny anymore.
 - Ah, sweet pity. Where would my love life be without it?
 - Our solution on ‘The Simpsons’ is to do jokes that people who have an education, or some frame of reference, can get. And for the ones who don’t, it doesn’t matter, because we have Homer banging his head and saying, ‘D’oh!’
 - I think ‘Family Guy’ and ‘American Dad’ have definitely staked out their own style and territory, and now the accusations are coming that ‘The Simpsons’ is taking jokes from ‘Family Guy.’ And I can tell you, that ain’t the case.
 - We have ‘Doctor Who’ references on ‘Futurama,’ but we have a lot of science fiction references that I don’t get; but in the staff we have experts on ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Doctor Who’ and ‘Dungeons and Dragons.’
 - I love the idea that we put in jokes the kids don’t get. And that later, when they grow up and read a few books and go to college and watch the show again, they can get it on a completely different level.
 - Cartooning is for people who can’t quite draw and can’t quite write. You combine the two half-talents and come up with a career.
 - We did ‘The Simpsons Movie,’ which took almost four years; it was the same people that do the TV show, and it just killed us. So that’s why there hasn’t been a second movie. But I imagine if the show ever does go off the air, they’ll start doing movies.
 - With animation, because you can draw anything and do anything and have the characters do whatever you want, the tendency is to be very loose with the boundaries and the rules.
 - Buy Space Ghost cereal, but don’t eat the prizes.
 - I always say that ‘Futurama’ is real, and ‘The Simpsons’ is fiction.
 - How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?
 - I’ve conducted an experiment on my kids. Instead of denying them access to media, I’ve encouraged it. They read comic books, play Nintendo and watch way too much TV.
 - I think people who work in comedy and humor are hesitant to analyze it too much, because you feel like if you take it apart, you’ll break it and not be able to put it back together again.

 - Think beer; drink beer.
 - One of the great things about the Internet is that you can read what everybody has to say about everything. It is fascinating to me, the critiques about humor by people who have no sense of humor.
 - The amazing thing about Freak Out! was that there was nothing quite like it in rock ’n roll at the time. It was really simultaneously crude and ugly, and incredibly sophisticated. The Beatles were funny, but there was nothing with the kind of sneer that you could feel in the music of Frank Zappa.
 - When DVDs finally disappear, I’m going to be sad. I’ll miss the commentaries.
 - The world ends when I die. And as far as I’m concerned, the rest of the universe might as well call it a day too.
 - When The Simpsons came around, there really was nothing else like it on TV. It’s hard to imagine, but when Fox first took the plunge with it, it was considered controversial to put animation on prime time.
 - My life changed when I was able to not only get seated in nice restaurants, I was given free appetizers. That was like, “Oh, my God, I’ve arrived”.

 - I’ve loved science fiction ever since I was a little kid, mainly from looking at the covers of science-fiction magazines and books, and I’ve read quite extensively as an adult.
 - The writers led by Mike Scully are fantastic. And they’re creating original stories that not only don’t repeat what we’ve already done, they also don’t repeat anything I’ve seen on television.

 - I can’t believe it! Reading and writing actually paid off!
 - Science fiction and comedy are generally a pretty bumpy mix.
 - You just have to keep in mind that the important relationship is the relationship with the audience. That’s what I try to do. Everything else is secondary.
 - You’ve got to embrace the future. You can whine about it, but you’ve got to embrace it.
 - English? Who needs that? I’m never going to England.
 - I’m presently incarcerated. Convicted of a crime I didn’t even commit. Hah! “Attempted murder”? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel prize for attempted chemistry? Do they?

 - But Marge, what if we chose the wrong religion? Each week we just make God madder and madder.
 - Sometimes people try to read into my strip and find out what my state of mind is. And I can say if I’m in a good mood, generally the comic strip starts out in a good mood, but the punchline is very negative and sour.
 - I don’t mind sharing the blame if she’ll just admit she started it.
 - A lot of people believe that if everybody just did what they were told – obeyed – everything would be fine. But that’s not what life is all about. That’s not real. It’s never going to happen.
 - My father was a really sharp cartoonist and filmmaker. He used to tape-record the family surreptitiously, either while we were driving around or at dinner, and in 1963 he and I made up a story about a brother and a sister, Lisa and Matt, having an adventure out in the woods with animals.
 - I like the ‘Simpsons’ pinball machines. Those are pretty great.
 - The thing about a cartoon is, you can do whatever you want. The tightrope that we are walking on ‘The Simpsons’ and ‘Futurama’ is ‘How do you continue to surprise the audience, but make them good surprises?’ Not every surprise is good, but you want to continue jolting people.
 - I may be biting off more than I can chew, but with ‘The Simpsons’ and with ‘Futurama,’ what I’m trying to do in the guise of light entertainment, if this is possible – is nudge people, jostle them a little, wake them up to some of the ways in which we’re being manipulated and exploited.
 - I think in daily newspapers, the way comic strips are treated, it’s as if newspaper publishers are going out of their way to kill the medium.
 - Everybody doesn’t have to get every joke. People really appreciate not being condescended to.
 - A lot of our writers, like Conan O’Brien, moved on to other things.
 - The nice thing about ‘Futurama’ for me personally was that it was a way to honor some of the traditional ideas in literary science fiction, not so much movie or television science fiction – although we have that too, obviously. Our situation, a workplace comedy, led to all sorts of stuff.
 - I have less to do with ‘The Simpsons’ every season, but I stick my nose in here and there. Basically, it’s just trying to keep the characters consistent and making sure the show has a soul.
 - I would prefer to listen to a French classical composer like Olivier Messiaen than to the pop hits of the day.
 - I was always frightened by taverns. They just seemed like very unpleasant places to go.
 - I’ve been deadline-driven for my whole grown-up life, and that hasn’t gone away. It is nice to be able to reflect about the big picture, about what kind of stories you want to tell, and how to take advantage of success.
 - I think when ‘The Simpsons’ first came on, there was an uproar. People got used to it. They realized the show’s really funny, it’s got a heart, so I think it’s pretty safe.
 - A lot of American shows don’t last for as long as 12 episodes. They get cut after one. But certainly one of the great things about The Office in particular was that there was a beginning, a middle and an end.
 - If at first you don’t succeed – give it up. It isn’t worth the pain.
 - Because good writing in a TV cartoon is so rare, I think the animation on The Simpsons is often overlooked.
 - Most TV shows don’t reward you for paying attention.
 - Donuts. Is there anything they can’t do?
 - I think there is a certain charm to the hand drawn image that I like. My problem with CGI is that it’s so rich in texture that my eyes actually get tired. Everything is in focus down to the littlest leaf.
 - The tendency in comedy is to have a character who’s stupid get more stupid, because you’re trying to top yourself and not just repeat.
 - We’ve got a bunch of new writers now who tell me they grew up watching The Simpsons. It’s bizarre, and they’re writing some very funny stuff.

 - How can I be expected to love someone who tries such crude manipulations as bringing me breakfast in bed?
 - I went through a phase where people would introduce me at parties as a cartoonist, and everybody felt sorry for me. ‘Oh, Matt’s a cartoonist.’ Then people further feeling sorry for me would ask me to draw Garfield. Because I’m a cartoonist, draw Snoopy or Garfield or something.
 - Vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and eskimos.
 - You know, the courts may not be working any more, but as long as everyone is videotaping everyone else, justice will be done.
 - I grew up completely overwhelmed by TV, and part of the reason why I have gone into television is as a way to justify to myself all those wasted hours of watching TV as a kid. I can now look back and say, ‘Oh, that was research.’

 - I always thought that television was the way to go in my goal to invade pop culture because it got to towns in which there were no bookstores. That’s how I used to think of it: How do I reach kids who not only don’t read but probably have no access to much in the way of books?
 - I personally like the idea of newspapers. It’s a good format. You can read it in whatever order you want. You can glance at it. There is something about a single screen and scrolling through pages that just doesn’t have the same appeal.
 - I had been drawing my weekly comic strip, ‘Life in Hell,’ for about five years when I got a call from Jim Brooks, who was developing ‘The Tracey Ullman Show’ for the brand-new Fox network. He wanted me to come in and pitch an idea for doing little cartoons on that show.
 - On ‘The Simpsons,’ I will say that we definitely like to comment on what’s going on in the world, and we try to be funny. If we can figure out a way of being funny about it, then we’ve gone part of the way of accomplishing our task.
 - One of the things I would like to do is make up stories that I would have enjoyed when I was a kid. So, if I’m thinking about an audience, it’s usually a younger version of myself.
