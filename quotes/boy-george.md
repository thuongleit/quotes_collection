 - My God is better than your God.
 - I wasn’t part of the Taboo crowd the same way I was part of the New Romantics. I suppose I was seen more as an elder statesman because I had been around the London club scene for so many years. To the Taboo crowd I was really seen as a pop star, someone famous.

 - Karma chameleon: we come and go, we come and go...

 - Comparing Madonna with Marilyn Monroe is like comparing Raquel Welch with the back of a bus.
 - What’s really sad is that a lot of very talented people are being forced to do things that are very embarrassing and I don’t intend to be one of them.
