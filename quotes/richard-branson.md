 - A company’s employees are its greatest asset and your people are your product.
 - As much as you need a strong personality to build a business from scratch, you also must understand the art of delegation. I have to be good at helping people run the individual businesses, and I have to be willing to step back. The company must be set up so it can continue without me.
 - Never look back in regret – move on to the next thing.
 - If you look after your staff, they’ll look after your customers. It’s that simple.

 - Spend more time smiling than frowning and more time praising than criticizing.
 - Always think, ‘what’s the worst that can happen’ and have some kind of strategy to deal with it.

 - Believe in yourself and back yourself to come out on top. A fulfilling career is waiting for those brave enough to find it.
 - Breaking the rules and challenging convention is in the DNA of every successful entrepreneur. Doing things differently and solving problems with new, innovative and fresh approaches are the very reason many start-ups are able to compete and sometimes outpace the established market leaders.
 - I’m sure you get the best out of people if you look for the best in them. People don’t need to be told when they’ve done something wrong – they know it without having to be told.

 - I have always lived my life by thriving on opportunity and adventure. Some of the best ideas come out of the blue, and you have to keep an open mind to see their virtue.
 - You can never go too far wrong by thinking like a customer who’s new to the business.

 - My general attitude to life is to enjoy every minute of every day. I never do anything with a feeling of, ‘Oh God, I’ve got to do this today.’
 - I just like to enjoy life and push myself. Of course, there is method to my madness. When you are entering into a new industry, for example, it helps to do something to get your name on the front pages.

 - Successful entrepreneurs don’t wait for the perfect moment – they create it.
 - Unless you dream, you’re not going to achieve anything.
 - People do not mind people who try things and fail. If you’re a good entrepreneur, you’re not going to succeed in every single thing you try. You’ve got to try to succeed at more things than fail.
 - Flowers flourish when they’re watered, and shrivel up when they’re not. People are no different. The best leaders are the ones who look for the best in people.

 - Two bricklayers work side by side. The first lays bricks. The second builds magnificent cathedrals. Think small vs. think big.

 - Anyone who makes an effort at whatever they hope to accomplish can, and will, seriously improve their chances of succeeding.
 - Be bold, brave and not afraid to fall on your face and ultimately you will succeed.

 - One day offices will be a thing of the past.
 - What matters is working with a few close friends, people you respect, knowing that if times did turn bad these people would hold together.
 - Never go into business purely to make money. If that’s the motive you’re better off doing nothing.

 - You shouldn’t blindly accept a leader’s advice. You’ve got to question leaders on occasion.

 - Ideally, since 80 percent of your life is spent working, you should start your business around something that is a passion of yours.
 - When people are placed in positions slightly above what they expect, they are apt to excel.
 - I have always lived my life by making lists: lists of people to call, lists of ideas, lists of companies to set up, lists of people who can make things happen. Each day I work through these lists, and that sequence of calls propels me forward.
 - Good people have always been at the heart of the Virgin business, and that’s largely because we have tried to keep our business small, and our management teams tight-knit. I feel that small, compact companies, are better run. That is partly because people feel more connected in small companies.

 - We spend most of our lives working. So why do so few people have a good time doing it?
 - I’m a great believer that saying yes is a lot more fun than saying no.
 - Early on in your career, find someone better than yourself to run the business on a day-to-day basis. Remove yourself, maybe even from the building, and from the nitty-gritty. That way, you’re going to be able to see the bigger picture and think of new areas to go into.
 - Take the competition seriously, but not yourself.
 - I have always believed that there is no point in having regrets as you learn far more from mistakes than successes. Embrace a mistake and learn from it; don’t regret them.
 - I want Virgin to be as well-known around the world as Coca-Cola.
 - For a successful entrepreneur it can mean extreme wealth. But with extreme wealth comes extreme responsibility. And the responsibility for me is to invest in creating new businesses, create jobs, employ people, and to put money aside to tackle issues where we can make a difference.
 - Purpose is not an add-on, it’s not an initiative. It is a culture change and it never finishes.

 - However tight things are, you still need to have the big picture at the forefront of your mind.
 - I have always been a huge believer in the inestimable value good mentoring can contribute to any nascent business.
 - Don’t hesitate to seek external help or advice where need be. Sometimes, it takes an external, emotionally unattached individual to detect your business flaws and render unbiased advice.
 - The amount of time people waste dwelling on failures rather than putting that energy into another project, always amazes me.
 - You know I think if the people who work for a business are proud of the business they work for, they’ll work that much harder, and therefore, I think turning your business into a real force for good is good business sense as well.
 - Good brands reflect the histories of the time and the group of people that made them. They can not be copied. They can not be recycled.
 - Realize that the people who are working with you, this is their life. You know, 80% of their time is spent at work. Make sure that they’re proud of what they’re doing, that they’re enjoying what they’re doing.
 - One thing is certain in business: you will make mistakes. When you are pushing the boundaries, mistakes are inevitable-how you react is important.
 - I never went into business to make money, but I have found that if I have fun, the money will come.
 - Oh God, I’ve got to do this today.
 - I think it’s quite great to set yourself a big challenge and then you’ve got another reason for keeping fit.
 - I’m not the sort of person who fears failure.
 - Customers shouldn’t just think of your business as a place to buy a product or use a service – it should be a fun place to be.

 - If you want to stand out from the crowd, give people a reason not to forget you.
 - Drive, determination, passion and hard work are all free and more valuable than a pot of cash.
 - People are no different from flowers. If you water them, they flourish. If you are not nice to them, they shrivel up.
 - Too many companies want their brands to reflect some idealised, perfected image of themselves. As a consequence, their brands acquire no texture, no character and no public trust.
 - Every great movement in the world starts with a tiny group of people who simply refuse to accept a situation.
 - There is no such thing as a boring person: everyone has stories and insights worth sharing. While on the road, we let our phones or laptops take up our attention. By doing that, we might miss out on the chance to learn and absorb ideas and inspiration from an unexpected source: our fellow travelers.
 - I have no secret. There are no rules to follow in business. I just work hard and, as I always have done, believe I can do it. Most of all, though, I try to have fun.
 - If you love what you do and if you believe in what you do, others will share your enthusiasm. Passionate people find their way to the Virgin Group, and when they do, we snap them up and try to keep them within the family.
 - I love stirring the pot. I love giving big companies a run for their money – especially if they’re offering expensive, poor-quality products.
 - If you find yourself stuck in the middle there is only one way to go, forward.
 - My parents brought me up with this philosophy. You must do things. You mustn’t watch what other people are doing. You must not listen to what other people are doing.
 - In the ’80’s my gut feeling was that airlines were crap. I hated spending time on planes. I thought we could create the kind of airline I’d like. So we got a secondhand 747 and gave it a go.

 - I rely far more on gut instinct than researching huge amounts of statistics.
 - The important thing is that you’ve got a strong foundation before you start to try to save the world or help other people.
 - Every single astronaut who has come back from space comes back determined to do more to protect it.

 - Ideas Are The Lifeblood Of Business. Capture Every Fleeting Idea And Drive For Change.

 - Business leaders take things far too seriously, and forget that most of the time people spend in their lives is at work, and it should be fun.
 - I’m not superstitious. I don’t really believe in star signs, sorry, or superstitions.
 - I believe that drudgery and clock-watching are a terrible betrayal of that universal, inborn entrepreneurial spirit.
 - I’m a true believer in working hard and partying hard. I’m fortunate to be one of those people who can have just as much fun partying without alcohol.
 - At the end, entrepreneurship is not about wearing expensive suits and earning a lot of money. It is all about being true to yourself, to your values in life. Your dreams.
 - Perhaps my early problems with dyslexia made me more intuitive: when someone sends me a written proposal, rather than dwelling on detailed facts and figures I find that my imagination grasps and expands on what I read.

 - Remember the to-do list but don’t forget the to-be list.
 - When people screw up, give them a second chance.
 - To get the respect of people, I think you’ve got to roll up your sleeves and lead with your people. The absolute key is treating your people well. Looking for the best in your people. Lots and lots of praise, no criticism.
 - If you’re bringing up kids, you just want to smother them with love and praise and enthusiasm. So I don’t think you can mollycoddle your kids too much really.
