 - Let them hate me, so long as they fear me!
 - I have existed from the morning of the world and I shall exist until the last star falls from the night. Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man and therefore I am a God.
 - Would that the Roman people had but one neck!
 - I scorn their hatred, if they do but fear me.
