 - A good leader gets people to follow him because they want to, not because he makes them.
 - God’s definition of success is really one of the significant differences our lives can make in the lives of others.

 - I never wanted our players to think the Super Bowl was the ultimate. I always talk about ‘Yes, we’re going to win, but what are we going to do as we’re winning? What are we going to do after we win?’ Winning the Super Bowl is not the destination. It’s not an end point. It’s what you do from here.
