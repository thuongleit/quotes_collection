 - Irony is the bringing together of two contradictory truths and to make out of the contradiction a new truth, with a laugh or a smile.

 - Everybody has bad relationships and, at the end of the day, they are just a great way to set yourself up for a good relationship.

 - I think the only thing in life that you really have to worry about is how you treat other people. If you mess up and treat someone else badly, you apologize, and you don’t apologize for anything else. Be yourself and go for it.

 - Love is a human experience, not a political statement.

 - Thank you for this lovely blunt object that I will forevermore use as a weapon against self-doubt.

 - It takes a minute for me to let my guard down, but once I do and I get to know someone, I’m very open, very trusting. Some might say too trusting, because considering the amount of money that can be made from selling gossip, I could be very easily taken advantage of.

 - I love working and I feel satisfied when I know I have literally given all the energy that I have. That being said, work is not my No. 1 priority. I don’t think it can come at the expense of your family, your friends and your ‘significant other’ if you have one.
 - My feeling about growing up in New Jersey was, ‘How come I’m not in New York?’ That being said, I’m older and I have a better worldview now, and so I think I grew up in an incredibly privileged position. The town I grew up in is beautiful. I got a great education, and I’m very grateful for it.
 - I want to work with people that frighten me and excite me, and characters that I don’t believe I’m the best person for the part but I’m still gonna try anyway. Those are my favorite roles.
 - I loved Catwoman’s sense of humor. I love how sly she is. I love how she, to use a cat metaphor, walks the fence and you don’t know which side she’s going to come down on. She’s totally independent. And let’s face it, she’s badass.
 - There’s nothing wrong with the fashion industry. What’s wrong is changing yourself for something you don’t really care about just to get somewhere faster.

 - A lot of people have told me, ‘You’re not this and so can’t play that,’ and I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve been told I’m not sexy. I don’t wear my sexiness overtly doesn’t mean that I can’t become that girl for a role. That’s what I do; I become things. Use your imagination.

 - Obsessing about weight is a big old waste of time.
 - I would never have gotten married if it weren’t for him. You have to want to be married to someone. You have to feel that reciprocated. Marriage for marriage’s sake doesn’t make any sense to me, and I found someone with whom I could put my money where my mouth is, I guess.
