 - I do a lot of cardio. I think it’s super important, especially for women. I don’t have a tremendous amount of time to work out, so I find myself cramming in a cardio because that’s all I can fit in. I think that if you don’t have a lot of time, that it’s the cleanest way to burn a few calories.
 - Sally Field looks amazing in general, never mind her age! She’s a phenomenally talented actress and has had a career spanning so many decades.
 - Humans should always exercise and watch what they eat. So with your pet, make sure they get enough exercise, make sure they’re getting fed at the same time every day and getting the nutrition they need. And make sure they get a lot of love and attention you both need. That’s why you have them!
