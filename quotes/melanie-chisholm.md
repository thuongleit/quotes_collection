 - A lot of the time, the British press make me ashamed and embarrassed to be British. They give others the impression that the British are selfish, envious and bitter people, which is simply not true in my opinion. I think that British people in general are really nice and friendly.

 - I recognise a lot of myself in these kids who enter shows like Pop Idol. It’s very hard to get into the music industry and you have to take every opportunity that you can. Something like Pop Idol is a great opportunity but unfortunately, I think it’s tainted by the people that make these shows.
 - Being in the Spice Girls was an insane experience.
