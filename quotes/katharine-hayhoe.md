 - Natural gas is a very flexible source of energy that can help us bridge the gap between our current high-carbon economy and our zero-carbon future.
 - For Christians, doing something about climate change is about living out our faith – caring for those who need help, our neighbors here at home or on the other side of the world, and taking responsibility for this planet that God created and entrusted to us.
 - Our carbon emissions have to eventually go to zero. We have to. Otherwise we’re never going to have a stable climate and that’s what our goal is for human civilization to thrive, a stable climate. We don’t want one that’s hotter, we don’t want one that’s colder, we want one that’s stable.
 - If we smoke, there’s no magic number of cigarettes, or number of years, that we can smoke before we know we’ll get lung cancer.
 - There has been a concerted effort to frame caring about climate change and the environment as an alternate religion – one that worships the creation rather than the creator, so to speak.
 - I feel like a physician, one who’s done a scan of the patient’s body and seen evidence of a potentially serious issue.
 - When I look around, the biggest way in which we are failing to care for those in need is through ignoring climate change and acting like it doesn’t exist. As a Christian, I believe that is something the church needs to know.
 - The word “evangelist” means someone who spreads good news. Studying the impacts of climate change as I do, it’s hard to come up with good news. In many ways I feel more like a Cassandra or a Jeremiah than a good-news evangelist.
 - Huge advances in clean energy technology are happening all the time. Solar and wind are booming. New ways to generate energy from our windows, the paint on our walls, and even our bike paths are being invented all the time. Technology is moving forward, but it needs to be moving forward faster.
 - We have to fix climate change with the people we have right now, and to a large extent with the perspectives we have right now as well.
 - People have taken advantage of the very well-trodden pathways that divide science and faith on other issues, such as creation, evolution, and the age of the universe, to pigeonhole climate change as yet another variant on the same theme.
 - It’s a new normal and I really do think that global weirding is the best way to describe what we’re seeing.
 - I don’t have to change the world all by myself, I just need to partner in the work God wants us to do.
 - There’s no question that natural gas is a lot better than coal or oil, in the sense that natural gas produces less carbon per unit of energy produced.
 - I feel that one of the most important things I can do is connect climate change to the values, the faith, and the issues we already care about. And if, in the process, I have to sidestep around some very explosive mines, I will do that.
 - When I talk to my neighbor, or to someone at church who doesn’t accept that the planet is changing, I know that they don’t know any better. They’ve been told this information by somebody they trust and it’s not their fault. They’ve just never heard otherwise.
 - I don’t think there are any churches that have “Thou shalt not believe in climate change” written in their actual statement of faith.
 - My faith tells me that God does want people to understand climate change and do something about it.
 - A person of faith who shares conservative values and who says very clearly that climate change is real – and here’s why we have to care about it – I think that we “unicorns” do pose a threat to people who want to muddy the waters and keep others in the dark.
 - There is no set period of time or total amount of carbon emissions that we can stay below to ensure we stay safe.
 - Where I live, if I put solar panels on my roof I’m not allowed to sell that energy back to the grid. I can’t change that restriction myself. I need our local decision-makers to fix that.
 - We have to reach out to churches and schools and help people understand science, and we have to build rapport between scientists and people of faith. Then once we get that understanding and rapport built, then everyone will be on board with climate change.
 - For many of us, our values come from our faith.
 - We’re not paying a real price for carbon. If we were, we wouldn’t be using as much. We need to have the right perspective. It’s not just about next quarter’s financial return. It’s about where we want to be in ten years.
 - I think it’s interesting that the United States and Australia are two of the most individualistic nations in the entire world in terms of national personality.
 - It’s a common perception that science and religion are mutually exclusive. But there are many scientists who would consider themselves to be spiritual people.
