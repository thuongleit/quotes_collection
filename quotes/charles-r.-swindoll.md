 - Leaders need to cultivate two things: a righteous heart and a rhinoceros skin.
 - Anything under God’s control is never out of control.
 - We have a choice every day regarding the attitude we will embrace for the day. Life is 10% what happens to us and 90% how we react to it. Our attitude is everything.
 - Only you can determine your choice of attitude. Choose wisely, choose carefully, choose confidently!
 - Vision is the ability to see God’s presence, to perceive God’s power, to focus on God’s plan in spite of the obstacles.

 - The stronger the winds, the deeper the roots, and the longer the winds, the more beautiful the tree.
 - We are often so caught up in our activities that we tend to worship our work, work at our play, and play at our worship.

 - God also allows suffering so that we might learn what it means to depend on Him, not on our own strength and resources.
 - Patience is a bitter plant that produces sweet fruit.
 - The decision to give ourselves to others is a daily taking up of the cross.
 - One of the marks of maturity is the ability to disagree without becoming disagreeable.
 - Excellence-moral, ethical, personal excellence-is worth whatever it costs.
 - Prejudice is a learned trait. You’re not born prejudiced; you’re taught it.
 - God will never adjust His agenda to fit ours. He will not speed up His pace to catch up with ours; we need to slow our pace in order to recover our walk with Him. God will not scream and shout over the noisy clamor; He expects us to seek quietness, where His still small voice can be heard again.
 - Worry erases the promises of God from your mind.
 - First impressions never have a second chance.
 - Friends make life a lot more fun.
 - When God is involved, anything can happen. Be open. Stay that way. God has a beautiful way of bringing good vibrations out of broken chords.
 - My order of priorities reflects the level of my commitment to Christ. Whoever or whatever is in first place, if it isn’t the Lord Jesus, is in the wrong place.
 - The happiest people I know are the ones who have learned how to hold everything loosely and have given the worrisome, stress-filled, fearful details of their lives into God’s keeping.
 - Worry is a complete waste of energy. It solves nothing.
 - It helps me if I remember that God is in charge of my day – not I.
 - Alleged ‘impossibilities’ are opportunities for our capacities to be stretched.
 - It is in lonely solitude that God delivers His best thoughts, and the mind needs to be still and quiet to receive them.
 - Don’t expect wisdom to come into your life like great chunks of rock on a conveyor belt. Wisdom comes privately from God as a byproduct of right decisions, godly reactions, and the application of spiritual principles to daily circumstances.
 - God’s timing is always on time.
 - Of all the things God created, I am often most grateful He created laughter.
 - Times may be hard and people may be demanding, but never forget that life is special. Every single day is a special day. God is at work in you!
 - We are in charge of our attitudes.

 - Lead with action and let the feelings follow.
 - Good listeners believe they can learn something from everyone.
 - Good intentions and earnest effort are not enough. Only Jesus can make an otherwise futile life productive.
 - When God’s in it, the job gets done.
 - Humility – the discipline of putting others ahead of self, the choice to value others above self – is, at its core, a matter of faith.
 - Another problem with worry is that it makes you forget your worth. Worry makes you feel worthless, forgotten, and unimportant.
 - Hope is like an anchor. Our hope in Christ stabilizes us in the storms of life, but unlike an anchor, it does not hold us back.
 - I know of no realm of life that can provide more companionship in a lonely world or greater feelings of security and purpose in chaotic times than the close ties of a family.
 - Pride leaves no room for grace.
 - No one is immune to temptation. Not even a hero. Not even a nobody. Not even people like you and me. Lust is never very far away. And just when you least expect it, there it is again.
 - Leadership is influence. To the extent we influence others, we lead them.
 - Encouragement is awesome. Think about it. It has the capacity to lift a man’s or a woman’s shoulders. To breathe fresh air into the fading embers of a smoldering dream. To actually change the course of another human being’s day, week, or life.
 - Words can never adequately convey the incredible impact of our attitudes toward life. The longer I live the more convinced I become that life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we respond to it.
 - There are times we need to tell ourselves, “Good job!” when we know that is true.
 - This tendency to avoid problems and the emotional suffering inherent in them is the primary basis of all human mental illness.
 - And when God steps in, His working is like the difference between a skyscraper and a star.
 - A story without context is like a diamond without a mounting. The stone may be beautiful lying loose on a table, but when it is carefully mounted in the right setting it can dazzle you with its brilliance and sparkling beauty.
 - Two words will help you cope when you run low on hope: accept and trust.
 - You see, when we talk about perfect trust, we’re talking about what gives us roots, character, the stability to handle the hard times. Trusting God doesn’t alter our circumstances. Perfect trust in Him changes us.
 - God never calls His people to accomplish anything without promising to supply their every need.
 - It is often just as sacred to laugh as it is to pray.
 - Christlikeness is a journey, not a destination. The joy is in the journey.
 - The Lord delights to surprise us with His goodness, if only we will unlock the door of obedience with the key of faith – which He has given – and then push it open and walk through.
 - God has not only created each of us as distinct individuals, He also uses us in significant ways.
 - Know yourself, like yourself, be yourself.
 - Like sin itself, Satan appeals to the senses. He originated and perfected the art of disguising evil as good.
 - You know one of the most encouraging things about faith? It pleases God.
 - The best tests of my Christian growth occur in the mainstream of life, not in the quietness of my study.
 - To require God to prove that He is able and willing to fulfill His promises would be proof positive that one does not trust Him.
 - GRACE: All you can do is take it.
 - Home is the bottom line of life, the anvil upon which attitudes and convictions are hammered out the single most influential force in our earthly existence. No price tag can adequately reflect its value.
 - If our perfect Lord is gracious enough to take our worst, and ugliest, our most boring, our least successful, and forgive them, burying them in the depths of the sea, then it’s high time we give each other a break.
 - I believe the single most significant decision I can make on a day-to-day basis is my choice of attitude. It is more important than my past, my education, my bankroll, my successes or failures, fame or pain, what other people think of me or say about me, my circumstances, or my position.
 - Because God gave you your makeup and superintended every moment of your past, including all the hardship, pain, and struggles, He wants to use your words in a unique manner. No one else can speak through your vocal cords, and, equally important, no one else has your story.
 - People who soar, are those who refuse to sit back and wish things would change.
 - To be used of God. Is there anything more encouraging, more fulfilling? Perhaps not, but there is something more basic: to meet with God.
 - Do you need strength? Peace? Wisdom? Direction? Discipline? Ask for it! God will hear you.
 - I’m here today to warn you: I want you to watch out for the adversary. Guard yourself from any spirit of entitlement. Restrain any and all subtle temptation to gain attention or to find ways to promote yourself.
 - There can be no more reliable authority on earth than God’s Word, the Bible. This timeless, trustworthy source of truth holds the key that unlocks life’s mysteries. It alone provides us with the shelter we need in times of storm.

 - Oh, how horrible our sins look when they are committed by someone else.
 - Joy springs from a life lived with eternity’s values in view.
 - How important is the heart! It is there that character is formed. It alone holds the secrets of true success. It’s treasures are priceless – but they can be stolen.

 - If God’s people are to be living examples of one thing, that thing ought to be – it must be – compassion.
 - One of the worst things you can give to your people is someone you’re not.
 - When you are giving people the gospel, you are giving them something to believe, and you have to set the stage for that. You don’t just drive up and dump the truck and drive off.
 - It is a pity that many Christians have the TV schedule better memorized than a single chapter for God’s precious Word.
 - When you have vision it affects your attitude. Your attitude is optimistic rather than pessimistic.
 - There is only one you. God wanted you to be you. Don’t you dare change just because you’re outnumbered!

 - I think it is important to begin with a statement in your speech that grabs the attention of the audience. I try to make my opening line 15 words or less.
 - When you pray, pray so that you may know Him. When you seek to simplify, do it as a means of knowing Him more. When you surrender, or behave with humility or sacrifice, do it with the sole purpose in mind to know Him.
 - It’s not our church; it’s God’s – it’s not our responsibility to run it!
 - You and I can become so dedicated to the will of God, we can be so driven by a false sense of purpose, that we might inadvertently take matters into our own hands and leave God completely out of the loop.
 - In spite of our high-tech world and efficient procedures, people remain the essential ingredient of life.
 - Any idol, regardless of its beauty or usefulness or original purpose, is to be set aside so that Christ might reign supreme, without a single competitor.

 - Thanksgiving is a time of quiet reflection; an annual reminder that God has, again, been ever so faithful. The solid and simple things of life are brought into clear focus.
 - Laughter is the most beautiful and beneficial therapy God ever granted humanity.
 - Attitude keeps me going or cripples my progress. It alone fuels my fire or assaults my hopes. When my attitudes are right, there is no barrier too high, no valley too deep, no dream too extreme, no challenge too great for me.
 - The secret of living a life of excellence is merely a matter of thinking thoughts of excellence. Really, it’s a matter of programming our minds with the kind of information that will set us free.
 - Trusting God doesn’t alter our circumstances. Perfect trust in Him changes us.
 - The longer I live, the more I realize the impact of attitude on life.
 - Acceptance is taking from God’s hand absolutely anything He gives, looking into His face in trust and thanksgiving.
 - Each day of our lives we make deposits in the memory banks of our children.

 - You can choose to be a drag and a burden, or an inspiration and encouragement.
 - Adversity is a good test of our resiliency, our ability to cope, to stand back up, to recover from misfortune. Adversity is a painful pedagogue.
 - Grace releases and affirms. It doesn’t smother. Grace values the dignity of individuals. It doesn’t destroy. Grace supports and encourages. It isn’t jealous or suspicious.
 - If the pace and the push, the noise and the crowds are getting to you, it’s time to stop the nonsense and find a place of solace to refresh your spirit.

 - An anniversary says, “Think of the dreams you have weathered together. They are intimate accomplishments.”

 - If I had my life to live over, I’d have spent more hours in worship.
 - Faith is like lighting the torch that passes from one person to the next. You can’t light the torch of another if yours isn’t burning.

 - The skeptic may deny your doctrine or attack your church but he cannot honestly ignore the fact that your life has been changed.
 - Love has been called the most effective motivational force in all the world. When love is at work in us, it is remarkable how giving and forgiving, understanding and tolerant we can be.
 - There is no counsel like God’s counsel. No comfort like His comfort. No wisdom more profound than the wisdom of the Scriptures.
 - It’s not enough merely to believe there is a God. You must believe in the God who is there.
 - Convictions are a matter of choice, not force.
 - Prayer is an investment. The time you dedicate to prayer isn’t lost; it will return dividends far greater than what a few moments spent on a task ever could. If we fail to cultivate this discipline, prayer winds up being our last resort rather than our first response.
 - We aren’t just thrown on this earth like dice tossed across a table. We are lovingly placed here for a purpose.
 - The more impossible the situation, the greater God accomplishes His work.
 - God doesn’t work on our timetable. He has a plan that He will execute perfectly and for the highest, greatest good of all, and for His ultimate glory.
 - Anyone who influences others is a leader.
 - Worry is assuming responsibilities that you cannot handle. They truth is, they are responsibilities that God never intended for you to handle, because they are His.
 - If you only knew what God had to take me through to get me to the place where he could use me to be a blessing to other people, I doubt whether you would be willing to pay the price.
 - Thanksgiving speaks in clear, crisp tones of forgotten terms, like integrity – bravery – respect – freedom – discipline – sacrifice – godliness.

 - No marriage is “too dead” for the Lord to restore.
 - When you suffer and lose, that does not mean you are being disobedient to God. In fact, it might mean you’re right in the center of His will. The path of obedience is often marked by times of suffering and loss.
 - Don’t get older; get better: Live realistically. Give generously. Adapt willingly. Trust fearlessly. Rejoice daily.
 - I believe firmly in God’s control in life.

 - The swift wind of compromise is a lot more devastating than the sudden jolt of misfortune.
 - Refuse to let your situation determine your attitude.

 - Vision encompasses vast vistas outside the realm of the predictable, the safe, the expected.
 - God never asked us to meet life’s pressures and demands on our own terms or by relying upon our own strength. Nor did He demands that we win His favor by assembling an impressive portfolio of good deeds. Instead, He invites us to enter His rest.
 - God often does His best work in us when He catches us by surprise and introduces a change that is completely against our own desire.
 - Envy is one of the great enemies of active spirituality. It keeps us from loving our neighbours, from functioning with others in community, and from affirming people’s unique worth. It also steals contentment from the heart. Is there anything or anyone you are envious of?
 - Next time you’re faced with a credit-purchase decision, wait. Don’t say no necessarily. Just wait. I challenge you to present your need to the Lord before presenting it to a bank, and see what He does with it.
 - When you accept the fact that sometimes seasons are dry and times are hard and that God is in control of both, you will discover a sense of divine refuge, because the hope then is in God and not in yourself.
 - When the Lord makes it clear you’re to follow Him in this new direction, focus fully on Him and refuse to be distracted by comparisons with others.
 - When you have a sense of calling, whether it’s to be a musician, soloist, artist, in one of the technical fields, or a plumber, there is something deep and enriching when you realize it isn’t just a casual choice, it’s a divine calling. It’s not limited to vocational Christian service by any means.
 - Today is unique! It has never occurred and it will never be repeated. At midnight it will end, quietly, suddenly, totally. Forever. But the hours between now and then are opportunities with eternal possibilities.
 - Strength comes from choosing to fully trust, pray, and praise. Our circumstances may not change, but in the process we change.
 - God does not dispense strength and encouragement like a druggist fills your prescription. The Lord doesn’t promise to give us something to take so we can handle our weary moments. He promises us Himself. That is all. And that is enough.
 - Anxious. Intriguing word. It literally means, “to be divided” or “distracted.” It conveys the idea of being so mentally ill at ease that you cannot do what you need to do because you are so distracted in your thinking.
 - When we panic, we instinctively turn to our own internal resources because we doubt Him.
 - Focusing intently on Christ naturally results in a lifestyle of increasingly greater selflessness. And it has another benefit. Gazing on Christ gives us greater ability to look past life’s trials and remain calm in the midst of what others would call chaos.
 - When a church is spending more of its budget on media than shepherding, something is out of whack. We have gotten things twisted around.
 - We need discernment in what we see and what we hear and what we believe.
 - God’s word is tailor-made for gray-slush days. It sends a beam of light through the fog. It signals safety when we fear we’ll never make it through.
 - Discipline is training that corrects and perfects our mental faculties or molds our moral character. Discipline is control gained by enforced obedience. It is the deliberate cultivation of inner order.
 - Allowing anger to seethe on the back burner will lead to a very large lid blowing off a very hot pot.
 - I have no interest in returning to yesteryear. I love the conveniences and delights of today’s time. I wouldn’t go back if I could.
 - God alone is perfectly and consistently just. We forget; God remembers. We see an action; God sees a motive. This qualifies Him as the best recordkeeper and judge.
 - When it seems like that’s all there is, remember all you have in Him.
 - Tell yourself right now and throughout today, that it’s okay to draw away from the maddening crowd. Jesus did; so can you.
 - Every one of us can blame somebody for something that has happened in our lives. But don’t waste your time. What we need most is a steady stream of love flowing among us. Love that quickly forgives, willingly overlooks, and refuses to take offense.
 - Ours is a bad, bad world, but does that mean nothing’s good? Does it mean we have run out of things for which to be grateful? No, no, a thousand times, no!
 - Go God’s way! His is the most reliable route to follow when life gets complicated. It will have its tough moments, but you will never regret it.
 - Do you want to be wise? Choose wise friends.
 - Let your life yield a sweet, winsome melody that this old world needs so desperately. Yes you can if you will.
 - The habit of always putting off an experience until you can afford it, or until the time is right, or until you know how to do it is one of the greatest burglars of joy. Be deliberate, but once you’ve made up your mind -jump in.
 - If you want to stop an argument, close your mouth.
 - God declared me righteous!
 - Remorse is sorrow over being caught and the pain of consequences that follow. Repentance is not being concerned for ourselves but having a contrite heart.
 - If you want to be a person with a large vision, you must cultivate the habit of doing the little things well.
 - Give us an intense distaste for things that displease You and a renewed pleasure in things that bring You honor and magnify Your truth.
 - Many seducers clutter the simple message of the gospel with legalistic additions, with convoluted attempts to legitimize moral compromise, and with psychological theories that turn churches into relational support groups instead of houses of worship.
 - Don’t seek more days in your life but more life in your days.
 - Jesus kept it simple. The lesson wasn’t complicated. ‘I speak; you believe My word; your son will be fine.’ We complicate what God has made simple by seeing the world through human eyes. We want to see in order to believe and presume that our limitations are His.
 - The wonderful thing about God is he knows what we need to persuade us.
 - If you never get criticized, chances are you aren’t getting anything done.
 - In spite of the extent to which Solomon went to find happiness, because he left God out of the picture, nothing satisfied. It never will. Satisfaction in life will never occur until there is a meaningful connection with the living Lord above the sun.

 - I am often the brunt of my own humor.
 - No, the thing that makes for greatness is determination, persisting in the right direction over the long haul, following your dream, staying at the task.

 - Servants must be big people. Big enough to go on, remembering the right and forgetting the wrong.
 - Joy is a deeply felt contentment that transcends difficult circumstances and derives maximum enjoyment from every good experience.

 - Those who feed on rumors are small, suspicious souls.
 - You won’t find God at the Seminary and you won’t find wisdom in the halls of intellectualism.
 - Sometimes people can’t see past us to hear our message. We never have a second chance to leave a first impression.
 - The size of a challenge should never be measured by what we have to offer. It will never be enough. Furthermore, provision is God’s responsibility, not ours. We are merely called to commit what we have – even if it’s no more than a sack lunch.
 - All he asks is that we trust Him, that we stand before Him in integrity and faith. God is just waiting for us to trust Him.
 - One of my great goals in life is to live long enough to where I am in the pulpit, preaching my heart out, and I die on the spot, my chin hits the pulpit – boom! – and I’m down and out. What a way to die!

 - Worry is characteristic of the heathen, not the Christian.
 - People who are close to God cultivate a personal intimacy with Him like a good gardener cultivates beautiful flowers.
 - If you are having difficulty loving or relating to an individual, take him to God. Bother the Lord with this person. Don’t you be bothered with him – leave him at the throne.
 - We continually encounter hardships. People disappoint us. We disappoint ourselves. But God is constant and compassionate. We are not alone. He cares. Against all reason, the transcendent God loves us so much that He has committed Himself to us.

 - Who can ever measure the benefit of a mother’s inspiration?
 - I don’t have to explain or defend the will of God. My job is simply to obey it.
 - Have you ever studied Jesus’s approach to talking with people? He didn’t always fill the space with answers for them. Let’s learn to do that with our fellow learners. Let’s give them room to think and answer for themselves.

 - Our minds can be kept free of anxiety as we dump the load of our cares on the Lord in prayer.

 - If you are going to achieve excellence in big things, you develop the habit in little matters.
 - Authentic men aren’t afraid to show affection, release their feelings, hug their children, cry when they’re sad, admit it when they’re wrong, and ask for help when they need it.
 - If I ever wrote a book on preaching, it would contain three words: Preach the Word. Get rid of all the other stuff that gets you sidetracked; preach the Word.
 - We shouldn’t deny the pain of what happens in our lives. We should just refuse to focus only on the valleys.

 - Noise and crowds have a way of siphoning our energy and distracting our attention, making prayer an added chore rather than a comforting relief.

 - Allow me to offer a simple definition of wisdom. Wisdom is looking at life from God’s point of view.
 - I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let’s face it, friends make life a lot more fun.

 - When we have God in clear focus, His powerful presence eclipses our fear.
 - More often than not, when something looks like it’s the absolute end, it is really the beginning.
 - I don’t see life divided into public and private, secular and sacred. It’s all an open place of service before our God.
 - Nothing is more bothersome to me than retiring. Weird things happen when you disengage; first you get negative, then you start telling people about your latest surgeries, and eventually you lose touch. I want to stay in touch.
 - It’s the nature of the beast within us to keep going back to the familiar rather than to strap on faith and face the future.
 - The remarkable thing is, we have a choice everyday regarding the attitude we will embrace for that day.
 - We want a crowd to make us feel important and liked. But why is getting a crowd our focus? Jesus never suggested that crowds were the goal. He never addresses getting your church to grow. Never.
 - It’s a delightful thing to receive a good word just at your time of need. Encourage someone today.
 - Rejoicing is clearly a spiritual command. To ignore it, I need to remind you, is disobedience.

 - God has somehow placed into Christian’s insides a special something, that extra inner reservoir of power that is more than a match for the stuff life throws at us.
 - Confidence brings joy when we let God be God.
