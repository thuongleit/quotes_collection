 - Always look for the fool in the deal. If you don’t find one, it’s you.

 - Creating opportunities means looking where others are not.
 - Find something you love to do. If you don’t make money at it, at least you love going to work.
 - Treat your customers like they own you. Because they do.

 - Sales is the most important aspect of a company, which in turn is about how well you treat your customer and stay ahead of your customer’s requirements.
 - Don’t get caught up in how many hours you work. Judge success based on having goals and measuring your results. Hard work, and lots of it, is certainly needed, but focus on what you get done.

 - Selling is never about convincing. It is always about helping.
 - One of the biggest mistakes entrepreneurs make is that we lie to ourselves. We don’t step back and look at ourselves like a competitor would.
 - Higher education is a business that doesn’t know it’s going out of business.
 - I think college is an absolute. In this world you have to learn how to learn and get in the habit of always wanting to learn. Some kids have that out of high school and may be able to do the college equivalent of home schooling. Most kids can’t. So I highly recommend going to college.
 - In business, to be a success, you only have to be right once.
 - Sweat equity is the most valuable equity there is. Know your business and industry better than anyone else in the world. Love what you do or don’t do it.

 - There are no shortcuts. You have to work hard, and try to put yourself in a position where if luck strikes, you can see the opportunity and take advantage of it.

 - Being a smart shopper is the first step to getting rich.
 - I learned how to become wealthy because I asked the right questions when I was broke.
 - If you want to deal with me, email is the way you do it. Working via email means that everything I do is searchable. I can go back and check out discussion threads from more than 15 years ago.
 - The idea that growth equals profitability is a misconception. If you can’t afford the financial or qualitative side of growth, it can just as easily put you out of business.

 - As far as businesses, I was always hustling. I had to pay for my own school. I got 20 bucks every week or 2 from my dad and that was it. So I had a “whatever it took” attitude.
 - Business happens over years and years. Value is measured in the total upside of a business relationship, not by how much you squeezed out in any one deal.
 - Just watch. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered. When you try to take it too far, people turn the other way. I’m just telling you, when you’ve got a good thing and you get greedy, it always, always, always, always, always turns on you. That’s rule No. 1 of business.
 - The one thing in life you can control is your effort. Are there any shortcuts in the beauty business? No. That was the first lesson I learned. You can’t just rocket to the top.

 - I hate politics. It’s slimy. Any job where people pander for votes, I don’t like. The country has gotten so partisan that if you’re not on my side, you’re the enemy. The only thing I ever try to support is a third party, like Unity08. We need more parties and more choice.
 - The reason I do Shark Tank isn’t to try take make more money of the deals, even though every deal I want to make money off of and even more so I want the entrepreneurs to be very successful and make money, but Shark Tank sends a message to everybody that the American Dream is alive and well.
 - I think you’ve got to be very, very careful when you start making blanket statements about what people say and think, as opposed to what they do. It’s a very, very slippery slope.
 - All that matters in business is that you get it right once. Then everyone can tell you how lucky you are.

 - Sports, music, movies – basically, fans of any form of entertainment don’t do a resume analysis before picking their favorite.

 - We don’t sell wins or losses. The one thing you can’t control in sports is which games you are going to win or which games you are going to lose. But what I could control was the experience the fans have.
 - If you think back to the first sporting event you went to, you don’t remember the score, you don’t remember a home run, you don’t remember a dunk. You remember who you were with. Were you with your mom, your dad, your brother, on a date?
 - Social media is just a platform. Twitter is a very simple and immediate broadcast platform. Facebook is a very personal, when it comes to friends and when it comes to fan pages, a little bit less but still somewhat personal way to communicate.
 - If Ayn Rand were an up-and-coming author today, she wouldn’t write about steel or railroads, it would be Net Neutrality.

 - One thing I learned in the NBA is that the No. 1 job of a general manager is to keep his job. They are only 30 positions where you make millions and hang around with basketball players all day.
 - Patent law holds us back, in every which way, shape or form. There is place for it, in physical products, in pharmaceuticals, but in software in particular, there is no place for it.
 - The stock market’s handling of new technology is kind of a joke. We have seen CNBC, CNNfn, Bloomberg, and the like turn into home-shopping networks for stocks. Fund managers and analysts go on TV and sell what’s shiny and easy to sell.
 - Open offices keep everyone in tune with what is going on and keep the energy up. If an employee is about privacy, show him or her how to use the lock on the bathroom.

 - In my opinion, right now there’s way too much hype on the technologies and not enough attention to the real businesses behind them.
 - In every job, I would justify it in my mind, whether I loved it or hated it, that I was getting paid to learn and every experience would be of value when I figured out what I wanted to do when I grew up.
 - I retired at twenty-nine, bought a life-time pass on American Airlines and my only goal in life was to party like a mad man and get drunk with as many people as possible. And I was happy right there. But when we started the streaming business, I knew it could be something big.

 - I can turn an idea into a business before you know it’s going to be important. My first step will blow by you.

 - Go out there and get rich. Get so obnoxiously rich that when that tax bill comes, your first thought will be to choke on how big a check you have to write.
 - Everyday I look in the mirror and make sure I don’t pinch myself so I don’t wake up. I don’t take it for granted. All the time I say: ‘Why me?’

 - Success is about making your life a special version of unique that fits who you are – not what other people want you to be.

 - If you’ve got $25,000, $50,000, $100,000, you’re better off paying off any debt you have because that’s a guaranteed return.
 - I just started a business called HDNet. There never is one area that has a door open to everyone. Try to find an area with something you love to do and do it. It’s a lot easier to work hard and prepare when you love what you are doing.
 - In today’s world of technology we should no longer be using outdated paper processes to accomplish tasks such as requisitions, reports, approvals, and purchase orders.
 - I’m scared shitless of heights.
 - Most people think money is the key to reducing risk. Prepartion is.
 - Business is a sport and I want to win. I want to kick your ass. I may not win every game. But I certainly am going to try.
 - One problem people have is that they lie to themselves. Rarely is talent enough. You have to find ways to make yourself standout. You do so by playing to your strengths and making people aware of those strengths.
 - In the past people used to tell me to shut up a bit. But what I believe is to put out your opinion and let everyone else react. If I’m wrong I’m wrong. People are afraid to put out their opinions and get push back.
 - There is very little knowledge that can’t be obtained through effort. With knowledge you can determine the state of any business or opportunity and find a course to gain an advantage.
 - When I started writing this blog more than years ago, it was in response to traditional media’s habit of twisting interviews to fit the headlines they wanted to create.
 - The key is having great players. But there are a lot of teams that have All-Stars and haven’t been able to put it together.
 - Being rich is a good thing. Not just in the obvious sense of benefitting you and your family, but in the broader sense. Profits are not a zero sum game. The more you make, the more of a financial impact you can have.
 - Sometimes you buy the horse, sometimes you invest in the jockey. It really comes down to the actual business and the upside.
 - I love helping entrepreneurs. It’s something I really have fun doing. It’s like planting a little seed and watching it grow. Any time I can help somebody, that’s a good thing. It’s fun. If I get to make some money at it, it’s even better.
 - You never quite know in business if what you are doing is the right or the wrong thing. Unfortunately, by the time you know the answer, someone has beaten you to it and you are out of business.
 - In business, one of the challenges is making sure that your product is the easiest to experience and complete a sale.

 - Never settle. There is no need to rush.
 - To me business is a sport. I love knowing that 24x7x365xforever I’m competing with people I don’t know. To build my businesses. To come up with new ideas. To come up with better ideas. That motivates me.
 - Everyone is passionate about something. Usually more than one thing. We are born with it. There are always going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really, really want to do with our lives. Those passions aren’t worth a nickel.
 - I don’t think people realize the risks they face every time they create a text, or post on a social network. Unless you expressly make the effort, everything you do online, including texting, has a shelf life of forever.

 - I look at my annual budgets for everything and anything, and I look to see where I can save the most money on those items. Saving 30% to 50% buying in bulk – replenishable items from toothpaste to soup, or whatever I use a lot of – is the best guaranteed return on investment you can get anywhere.
 - I worked hard and smarter than most people in the businesses I have been in.
 - It would have been easy to judge effort by how many hours a day passed while I was at work. That’s the worst way to measure effort. Effort is measured by setting goals and getting results.

 - I create offbeat advice; I don’t follow it. I rarely take third-party advice on my investments.
