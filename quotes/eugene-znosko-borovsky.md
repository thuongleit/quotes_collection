 - Haste is never more dangerous than when you feel that victory is in your grasp.
 - It is not a move, even the best move that you must seek, but a realizable plan.
 - The middlegame I repeat is chess itself, chess with all its possibilities, its attacks, defences, sacrifices, etc.
 - Haste, the great enemy.
 - Chess is a game of understanding and not of memory.
 - Avoidance of mistakes is the beginning, as it is the end, of mastery in chess.
 - A defeatist spirit must inevitably lead to disaster.
 - To find the best moves great Masters, with years of experience, engage in laborious research, and the moves thus found are blindly repeated by amateurs without any attempt to fathom their real meaning and how and why they stand in their context.
