 - Art is a reflection of God’s creativity, an evidence that we are made in the image of God.
 - Jesus taught that the mark of the Christian is the observable love shown among all true believers.
 - True spirituality consists in living moment to moment by the grace of Jesus Christ.
 - Modern man has both feet firmly planted in mid-air.
 - Our relationship with each other is the criterion the world uses to judge whether our message is truthful – Christian community is the final apologetic.
 - Biblical orthodoxy without compassion is surely the ugliest thing in the world.
 - People drift from generation to generation, and the morally unthinkable becomes thinkable as the years move on.
 - Truth carries with it confrontation. Truth demands confrontation; loving confrontation, but confrontation nevertheless.
 - Thank God for the reality for which we were created, a moment-by-moment communication with God himself.
 - Most people catch their presuppositions from their family and surrounding society the way a child catches measles.
 - Apostasy must be called what it is, spiritual adultery.
 - I am afraid that as evangelicals, we think that a work of art only has value if we reduce it to a tract.
 - Man, made in the image of God, has a purpose – to be in relationship to God, who is there. Man forgets his purpose and thus he forgets who he is and what life means.
 - One of the greatest injustices we do to our young people is to ask them to be conservative. Christianity is not conservative, but revolutionary.
 - If there is no absolute by which to judge society, society is absolute.
 - The beginning of men’s rebellion against God was, and is, the lack of a thankful heart.
 - If there is no absolute beyond man’s ideas, then there is no final appeal to judge between individuals and groups whose moral judgments conflict. We are merely left with conflicting opinions.
 - Eternity will be wonderful, but there is one thing heaven will not contain, and that is the call, the possibility, and the privilege of living a supernatural life here and now by faith, before we meet Jesus face to face.
 - Christian art is the expression of the whole life of the whole person as a Christian. What a Christian portrays in his art is the totality of life. Art is not to be solely a vehicle for some sort of self-conscious evangelism.
 - We must remember throughout our lives that in God’s sight there are no little people and no little places. Only one thing is important: to be consecrated persons in God’s place for us, at each moment.
 - There is a sad myth going around today – the myth of neutrality. According to this myth, the secular world gives every point of view an equal chance to be heard. And it works fairly well – unless you are a Christian.
 - If there is no absolute moral standard, then one cannot say in a final sense that anything is right or wrong.
 - This equation of the impersonal plus time plus chance producing the total configuration of the universe and all that is in it, modern people hold by faith.
 - The purpose of apologetics is not just to win an argument or a discussion, but that people with whom we are in contact may become Christians and then live under the Lordship of Christ in the whole spectrum of life.
 - Ours is a post-Christian world in which Christianity, not only in the number of Christians but in cultural emphasis and cultural result, is no longer the consensus or ethos of our society.
 - In fact, philosophy is universal in scope. No man can live without a world view; therefore, there is no man who is not a philosopher.
 - God has communicated to man, the infinite to the finite. The One who made man capable of language in the first place has communicated to man in language about both spiritual reality and physical reality, about the nature of God and the nature of man.
 - We cannot deal with people like human beings, we cannot deal with them on the high level of true humanity, unless we really know their origin-who they are. God tells man who he is. God tells us that He created man in His image. So man is something wonderful.
 - I believe that pluralistic secularism, in the long run, is a more deadly poison than straightforward persecution.
 - In my reading of philosophy, I saw that there were innumerable problems that nobody was giving answers for. the Bible, it struck me, dealt with man’s problems in a sweeping, all-encompassing thrust.
 - In passing, we should note this curious mark of our own age: the only absolute allowed is the absolute insistence that there is no absolute.
 - Each generation of the church in each setting has the responsibility of communicating the gospel in understandable terms, considering the language and thought-forms of that setting.
 - There is nothing more ugly than an orthodoxy without understanding or compassion.
 - I am convinced that when Nietzsche came to Switzerland and went insane, it was not because of venereal disease, though he did have this disease. Rather, it was because he understood that insanity was the only philosophic answer if the infinite-personal God does not exist.
 - We should not view men with a cynical eye, seeing them only as meaningless products of chance, but, on the other hand, we should not go to the opposite extreme of seeing them romantically. To do either is to fail to understand who men really are – creatures made in the image of God but fallen.
 - Tell me what the world is saying today, and I’ll tell you what the church will be saying in seven years.
 - We as Bible-believing evangelical Christians are locked in a battle. This is not a friendly gentleman’s discussion. It is a life and death conflict between the spiritual hosts of wickedness and those who claim the name of Christ.
 - He who loses the arts loses the culture.
 - If the church is what it should be, young people will be there. But they will not just ‘be there’ – they will be there with the blowing of horns and the clashing of high-sounding cymbals, and they will come dancing with flowers in their hair.
 - The soul is not more important than the body. God made the whole man and the whole man is important.
 - Sometimes the greatest deterrent to a great marriage is believing you have a perfect marriage.
 - The spiritual battle, the loss of victory, is always in the thought-world.
 - If I’m going to be in the right relationship with God, I should treat the things he has made in the same way he treats them.
 - If Christianity is really true, then it involves the whole man, including his intellect and creativeness. Christianity is not just ‘dogmatically’ true or ‘doctrinally’ true. Rather, it is true to what is there, true in the whole area of the whole man in all of life.
 - A Christian should use these arts to the glory of God, not just as tracts, mind you, but as things of beauty to the praise of God. An art work can be a doxology in itself.
 - All men bear the image of God. They have value not because they are redeemed, but because they are God’s creation in God’s image.
 - Truth carries with it confrontation.
 - Christianity believes that God has created an external world that is really there; and because He is a reasonable God, one can expect to be able to find the order of the universe by reason.
 - Things, things, things. Always more things, and success is seen as the abundance of things.
 - The church’s or Christian group’s methods are as important as its message.
 - This is not an age in which to be a soft Christian.
 - Christianity provides a unified answer for the whole of life.
 - If one starts with an impersonal beginning, the answer to morals eventually turns out to be the assertion that there are no morals.
 - Modern multiple divorce is rooted in the fact that many are seeking in human relationships what human relationships can never give. Why do they have multiple divorce, instead of merely promiscuous affairs? Because they are seeking more than merely sexual relationship.
 - Some psychological and sociological conditioning occurs in every man’s life and this affects the decisions he makes. But we must resist the modern concept that all sin can be explained merely on the basis of conditioning.
 - The modern concept of separation is an argument for a total separation of religion from the state. The consequence of the acceptance of the doctrine leads to the removal of religion as an influence in civil government.
 - Modern man has not only thrown away Christian theology, he has thrown away the possibility of what our forefathers had as a basis for morality and law.
 - There would have been no Bach had there been no Luther.
 - If Christians win a battle by using worldly means, they have really lost.
 - The Christian in the one whose imagination should fly beyond the stars.
 - Our trusting the Lord does not mean that there are not times of tears. I think it is a mistake as Christians to act as though trusting the Lord and tears are not compatible.
 - And the purpose of our creation, in which all our subsidiary purposes fit, is to be in a personal relationship to God, in communion with him, in love, by choice, the creature before the Creator.
 - Eve doubted God, and I as a child of God am now to be exactly the opposite: I am to believe him. Eve doubted, and mankind in revolt doubts God. To believe him, not just when I accept Christ as Savior, but every moment, one moment at a time: this is the Christian life, and this is true spirituality.
 - Any denomination or church group that forsakes inerrancy will end up shipwrecked. It is impossible to prevent the surrender of other important doctrinal teachings of the Word of God when inerrancy is gone.
 - You must not lose confidence in God because you lost confidence in your pastor. If our confidence in God had to depend upon our confidence in any human person, we would be on shifting sand.
 - Christian art today should be twentieth-century art.
 - Preaching the gospel without the Holy Spirit is to miss the entire point of the command of Jesus Christ for our era. In the area of “Christian activities” or “Christian service,” how we are doing it is at least as important as what we are doing.
 - Reformation is a return to the sound doctrine of the Bible. Revival is the practice of that sound doctrine under the power of the Holy Spirit.
 - If you want a significant man, with absolutes, morality, and meaning, then you must have what the Bible insists upon – that God will judge men justly, and they will not be able to raise their voices because of the base upon which He judges them.
 - The overall way of thinking in the United States has shifted away from basic Biblical values, and the media share in the responsibility for this change.
 - When my conscience under the Holy Spirit makes me aware of a specific sin I should at once call that sin sin and bring it consciously under the blood of Christ.
 - Humanism is not wrong in its cry for sociological healing, but humanism is not producing it.
 - A compassionate open home is part of Christian responsibility, and should be practiced up to the level of capacity.
 - The church is something beautiful.
 - If there is no final place for civil disobedience, then the government has been made autonomous, and as such, it has been put in the place of the living God.
 - If we do not show love to one another, the world has a right to question whether Christianity is true.
 - The Christian should be the person who is alive, whose imagination absolutely boils, which moves, which produces something a bit different from God’s world because God made us to be creative.
 - The inward area is the first place of loss of true Christian life, of true spirituality, and the outward sinful act is the result.
 - In God’s world the individual counts. Therefore, Christian art should deal with the individual.
 - There are two main reasons why we may not be bringing forth the fruit we should. It may be because of ignorance, because we may never have been taught the meaning of the work of Christ for our present lives.
 - The basic problem of the Christians in this country in the last eighty years or so, in regard to society and in regard to government, is that they have seen things in bits and pieces instead of totals.
 - We must stress that the basis for our faith is neither experience nor emotion but the truth as God has given it in verbalized, prepositional form in the Scripture and which we first of all apprehend with our minds.
 - To die is to be with the Lord. It is not just an idea, it is a reality.
 - As Christians, we must see that just because an artist-even a great artist-portrays a worldview in writing or on canvas, it does not mean that we should automatically accept that worldview. Good art heightens the impact of that worldview, but it does not make it true.
 - Christ’s crucifixion was on a hill, by a road, where everybody who passed by could not only see his pain, but also his shame. It was not done in a shadow, hidden away somewhere.
 - The one thing the media abhors almost without exception is anyone who takes a firm stand on any issue out of religious principle, unless their stand happens to coincide with their expressed views.
 - If God exists and we are made in his image we can have real meaning, and we can have real knowledge through what he has communicated to us.
 - This shift from the Judeo-Christian basis for law and the shift away from the restraints of the Constitution automatically militates against religious liberty.
 - Truth always carries with it confrontation. Truth demands confrontation; loving confrontation nevertheless. If our reflex action is always accommodation regardless of the centrality of the truth involved, there is something wrong.

 - We must not only be True. We must be Beautiful.
 - The ordinary Christian with the Bible in his hand can say that the majority is wrong.
 - Today the separation of church and state in America is used to silence the church. When Christians speak out on issues, the hue and cry from the humanist state and media is that Christians, an all religions, are prohibited from speaking since there is a separation of church and state.
 - Reality is not meant to be only creedal, though the creeds are important. Reality is to be experienced, and experienced on the basis of a restored relationship with God through that finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ on the cross.
 - I have come to the conclusion that none of us in our generation feels as guilty about sin as we should or as our forefathers did.

 - The central problem is always in the midst of the people of God, not in the circumstances surrounding them.
 - It is only as we consciously bring each victory to His feet, and keep it there as we think of it – and especially as we speak of it – that we can avoid the pride of that victory, which can be worse than the sin over which we claim to have had the victory.
 - What we, the Christian community, have to do is to refuse men the right to ravish our land, just as we refuse them the right to ravish our women; to insist that somebody accepts a little less profit by not exploiting nature.
 - So our building of the visible Church becomes much like any natural business function, using natural means and natural motives.
 - Christianity is the greatest intellectual system the mind of man has ever touched.
 - When a man comes under the blood of Christ, his whole capacity as a man is refashioned. His soul is saved, yes, but so are his mind and his body. True spirituality means the lordship of Christ over the total man.
 - Most people do not realize that there was a paid chaplain in Congress even before the Revolutionary War ended.
 - If man has been kicked up out of that which is only impersonal by chance, then those things that make him man-hope of purpose and significance, love, motions of morality and rationality, beauty and verbal communication-are ultimately unfulfillable and thus meaningless.
 - Belief does not change what is.
 - I hesitate to add, but I will, that this is fun. God means Christianity to be fun. There is to be a reality of love and communication in the Christian-to-Christian relationship, individually and corporately, which is completely and truly personal.
 - To fail to exhibit that we take truth seriously at those points where there is a cost in our doing so, is to push the next generation in the relative, dialectical millstream that surrounds us.
 - There is no place in God’s world where there are no people who will come and share a home as long as it is a real home.
 - How should an artist begin to do his work as an artist? I would insist that he begin his work as an artist by setting out to make a work of art.
 - The difference between Christian thinking and the non-Christian philosopher has always been at this point. The non-Christian philosopher has always said that man is normal now, but biblical Christianity says he is abnormal now.
