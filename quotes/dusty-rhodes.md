 - Get a dream, hold on to it and shoot for the sky.
 - I have wined and dined with kings and queens and I’ve slept in alleys and dined on pork and beans.
 - I am the hit-maker, the record-breaker. I got style and grace, a pretty face. I’ll make your back crack, your liver quiver.
 - I have supped mead with lords and ladies; so to have I slumbered in nameless lanes and gored upon mutton.
 - Ric Flair, the stratosphere is reserved for you and me.
 - I’m thankful for my POLKADOTS!
