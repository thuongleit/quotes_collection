 - There is no remedy, but you must either turn or burn.
 - O miserable man, what a deformed monster has sin made you! God made you “little lower than the angels”; sin has made you little better than the devils.
 - There is no surer evidence of an unconverted state than to have the things of the world uppermost in our aim, love, and estimation.
 - None are drawn to Christ by their calling, nor come to him by believing, but only his sheep, those whom the Father has given him,. Effectual calling runs parallel with eternal election.
