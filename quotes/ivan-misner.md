 - Networking is more about farming than it is about hunting.
 - Success is the uncommon application of common knowledge.
 - First, you have to be visible in the community. You have to get out there and connect with people. It’s not called net-sitting or net-eating. It’s called networking. You have to work at it.
 - Referrals aren’t given easily. If you don’t take the time to establish credibility, you’re not going to get the referral. People have to get to know you. They have to feel comfortable with who you are and what you do.

 - You can make a good living while serving a greater good.
