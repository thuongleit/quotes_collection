 - No great achiever – even those who made it seem easy – ever succeeded without hard work.
 - Follow your passion. Nothing – not wealth, success, accolades or fame – is worth spending a lifetime doing things you don’t enjoy.
 - True freedom requires the rule of law and justice, and a judicial system in which the rights of some are not secured by the denial of rights to others.

 - The supreme religious challenge is to see God’s image in one who is not in our image.
 - It is through exchange that difference becomes a blessing, not a curse.
 - The Holocaust survivors are among the most inspiring people I have had the privilege to meet.
 - Values are tapes we play on the Walkman of the mind: any tune we choose so long as it does not disturb others.
 - The test of faith is whether I can make space for difference. Can I recognize God’s image in someone who is not in my image, who language, faith, ideal, are different from mine? If I cannot, then I have made God in my image instead of allowing him to remake me in his.
 - In our interconnected world, we must learn to feel enlarged, not threatened, by difference – that is what I have argued.
 - Happiness is not made by what we own. It is what we share.
 - To defend a country you need an army, but to defend a civilization you need education.
 - Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.
 - What creates freedom? A revolution in the streets? Mass protest? Civil war? A change of government? The ousting of the old guard and its replacement by the new? History, more often than not, shows that hopes raised by such events are often dashed, sooner rather than later.
 - Some years ago there was a study to discover the most stressful occupation. It turned out not to be the head of a large business, football manager or prime minister, but rather: bus driver.
 - Just as the natural environment depends on biodiversity, so the human environment depends on cultural diversity, because no one civilization encompasses all the spiritual, ethical and artistic expressions of mankind.
 - There’s always hope. You can lose everything else in the world, but Jews never lose hope.
 - Close to a billion people – one-eighth of the world’s population – still live in hunger. Each year 2 million children die through malnutrition. This is happening at a time when doctors in Britain are warning of the spread of obesity. We are eating too much while others starve.
 - Faith is not a certainty. Faith is the courage to live with uncertainty.
 - Science takes things apart to see how they work. Religion puts things together to see what they mean.
 - Technology gives us power, but it does not and cannot tell us how to use that power. Thanks to technology, we can instantly communicate across the world, but it still doesn’t help us know what to say.
 - Cyberspace can’t compensate for real space. We benefit from chatting to people face to face.
 - If you want a free society, teach your children what oppression tastes like. Tell them how many miracles it takes to get from here to there. Above all, encourage them to ask questions. Teach them to think for themselves.
 - Parenthood involves massive sacrifice: money, attention, time and emotional energy.
 - We do not always appreciate the role the Queen has played in one of the most significant changes in the past 60 years: the transformation of Britain into a multi-ethnic, multi-faith society. No one does interfaith better than the Royal family, and it starts with the Queen herself.
 - God’s forgiveness allows us to be honest with ourselves. We recognize our imperfections, admit our failures, and plead to God for clemency.
 - The wisest rule in investment is: when others are selling, buy. When others are buying, sell. Usually, of course, we do the opposite. When everyone else is buying, we assume they know something we don’t, so we buy. Then people start selling, panic sets in, and we sell too.
 - The world we build tomorrow is born in the stories we tell our children today. Politics moves the pieces. Education changes the game.
 - When we love and make loving commitments, we create families and communities within which people can grow and take risks, knowing that hands will be there to catch them should they fall.
 - When money rules, we remember the price of things and forget the value of things, and that is dangerous.
 - In Judaism faith means wrestling with God as Jacob once wrestled with an angel...
 - We should challenge the relativism that tells us there is no right or wrong, when every instinct of our mind knows it is not so, and is a mere excuse to allow us to indulge in what we believe we can get away with. A world without values quickly becomes a world without value.
 - Religion survives because it answers three questions that every reflective person must ask. Who am I? Why am I here? How then shall I live?
 - The first of the request prayers in the daily Amidah is a fractal. It replicates in miniature the structure of the Amidah as a whole.
 - Freedom is not won by merely overthrowing a tyrannical ruler or an oppressive regime. That is usually only the prelude to a new tyranny, a new oppression.
 - Religious ritual is a way of structuring time so that we, not employers, the market or the media, are in control. Life needs its pauses, its chapter breaks, if the soul is to have space to breathe.
 - A perfect storm is in the making: financial uncertainty, economic downturn, government cuts, rising unemployment and a future that looks less clear the more we try to fathom it.
 - Jews read the books of Moses not just as history but as divine command. The question to which they are an answer is not, ‘What happened?’ but rather, ‘How then shall I live?’ And it’s only with the exodus that the life of the commands really begins.
 - Jews survived all the defeats, expulsions, persecutions and pogroms, the centuries in which they were regarded as a pariah people, even the Holocaust itself, because they never gave up the faith that one day they would be free to live as Jews without fear.

 - Jews have deep respect for the Queen and the royal family. We say a prayer for them every Sabbath in synagogue. We recite a special blessing on seeing the Queen.
 - In virtually every Western society in the 1960s there was a moral revolution, an abandonment of its entire traditional ethic of self-restraint.
 - The message of Passover remains as powerful as ever. Freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home. Teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it.

 - Find people not to envy but to admire. Do not the profitable but the admirable deed. Live by ideals.
 - Yahoo has gone too far in wrongfully accusing us of a conspiracy that doesn’t exist. If they are having problems retaining engineers, they should be looking at the internal sources of employee dissatisfaction rather than trying to cover that up with this legal action.
 - The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world. Across the centuries, Passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of Jews with its annually re-enacted drama of slavery and liberation.
 - In her religious role, the Queen is head of the Church of England, but in her civic role she cares for all her subjects, and no one is better at making everyone she meets feel valued.
