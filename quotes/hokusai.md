 - Since the age of six I have had the habit of sketching forms of objects. Although from about fifty I have often published my pictorial works, before the seventieth year none is worthy.
 - What is drawing? It is working oneself through an invisible iron wall that seems to stand between what one feels and what one can do. â€“ Vincent van Gogh, The Letters of Vincent van Gogh to His Brother.
 - If heaven gives me ten more years, or an extension of even five years, I shall surely become a true artist.
