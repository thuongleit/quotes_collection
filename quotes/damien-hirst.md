 - I think suicide is the most perfect thing you can do in life.
 - So smoking is the perfect way to commit suicide without actually dying. I smoke because it’s bad, it’s really simple.
 - I love art. It is uplifting.
 - The spot paintings, the spin paintings, they’re all a mechanical way to avoid the actual guy in a room, myself, with a blank canvas.
 - Great art – or good art – is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don’t think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.

 - When we are no longer children, we are already dead.
 - It’s amazing what you can do with an E in A-Level art, a twisted imagination and a chainsaw.
 - I always try to make everyone mellow down, make sure everybody’s happy. The people I have employed have always kind of stayed with us. A lot of people who come to work for you are artists in their own right. And they want to work for you because they want to pick something up.
 - Since I was a child, death is definitely something that I think about every day. But I think that everybody does. You try and avoid it, but it’s such a big thing that you can’t.

 - If the choice is between buying another building or a Pollock, I’d go for the Pollock every time.

 - I definitely think about death. And every day your relationship with death changes. And every day I sort of feel like I know it more. I’ve always thought about it.
 - I was taught to confront things you can’t avoid. Death is one of those things. To live in a society where you’re trying not to look at it is stupid because looking at death throws us back into life with more vigour and energy. The fact that flowers don’t last for ever makes them beautiful.

 - I love color. I feel it inside me. It gives me a buzz.

 - I wanted a shark that’s big enough to eat you, and in a large enough amount of liquid so that you could imagine you were in there with it.

 - A lot of people thought I wasn’t doing anything because I was spending a lot of time socialising and going out, but I’ve always managed to get work actually done.
 - I think an ashtray is the most fantastically real thing.
 - When I used to do abstract paintings at school, like everyone else, the tutor said these would make great curtains. I would always neglect the formal stuff that was going on by using colour, because colour kind of came naturally to me.
 - I think I’ve always been afraid of painting, really. Right from the beginning. All my paintings are about painting without a painter. Like a kind of mechanical form of painting. Like finding some imaginary computer painter, or a robot who paints.
 - I have titles floating around in my head; I have sculptures floating around in my head. It’s like a collage.
 - I sometimes feel that I have nothing to say and I want to communicate this.
 - I’ve never learned to drive because I get lots of ideas when I’m a passenger in a car. I love to get in a car with a driver and just think and work things out.
 - For me, art is always a kind of theater. When I started the spot paintings I made them as an endless series. But I was never serious about it being an endless series. It was just an implied endless series. The theater means you just have to make it look good for that moment in the spotlight.
 - I can’t wait to get into a position to make really bad art and get away with it.

 - I realised that you couldn’t use the tools of yesterday to communicate today’s world. Basically, that was the big light that went on in my head.
 - I can’t wait to get into a position to make really bad art and get away with it. At the moment if I did certain things people would look at it, consider it and then say “f off”. But after a while you can get away with things.
 - In fact, the first piece of art I ever sold, I paid someone else to make the next one, so I could actually keep going out drinking.
 - Death’s just something that inspires me, not something that pulls me down. I used to get called morbid at school. I have always loved horror films; I like being frightened.
 - What I really like is minimum effort for maximum effect.
 - Even as a kid in drawing class, I had real ambition. I wanted to be the best in the class, but there was always some other feller who was better; so I thought, It cant be about being the best, it has to be about the drawing itself, what you do with it. Thats kind of stuck with me.
 - Here’s one from me: ‘You have to be aware that everyone else is thinking far too hard about themselves to be thinking about you, whoever you are.’ If you want it, you can have it. Once you know that, you can be free.
 - As an artist, you don’t stop making art because people are not buying it.

 - You’ve got to be able to copy things faithfully before you can deviate.

 - For artists it’s a lot easier to make art in bad times than it is in good times. When you’ve got no money it’s easy to just drink your way through it and make great art. But if you’re making lots of money it can be very problematic.
 - It’s such a crass idea – you’re either in love or out of love.
