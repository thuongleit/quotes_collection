 - Management is, above all, a practice where art, science, and craft meet.
 - Strategy is a pattern in a stream of decisions.
 - Leadership, like swimming, cannot be learned by reading about it.
 - Learning is not doing; it is reflecting on doing.
 - An enterprise is a community of human beings, not a collection of “human resources”.
 - The real challenge in crafting strategy lies in detecting subtle discontinuities that may undermine a business in the future. And for that there is no technique, no program, just a sharp mind in touch with the situation.
 - While hard data may inform the intellect, it is largely soft data that generates wisdom.
 - Strategy is not the consequence of planning, but the opposite: its starting point.
 - Never set out to be the best. It’s too low a standard. Set out to be good. Do Your best.
 - Managers who don’t lead are quite discouraging, but leaders who don’t manage don’t know what’s going on. It’s a phony separation that people are making between the two.
 - Strategic planning is not strategic thinking. Indeed, strategic planning often spoils strategic thinking, causing managers to confuse real vision with the manipulation of numbers.
 - Five coordinating mechanisms seem to explain the fundamental ways in which organizations coordinate their work: mutual adjustment, direct supervision, standardization of work processes, standardization of work outputs, and standardization of worker skills.
 - Effective managing therefore happens where art, craft, and science meet. But in a classroom of students without managerial experience, these have no place to meet there is nothing to do.
 - No job is more vital to our society than that of the manager. It is the manager who determines whether our social institutions serve us well or whether they squander our talents and resources.
 - Empowerment is what managers do to people. Engagement is what managers do with people.
 - Everyone is against micro managing but macro managing means you’re working at the big picture but don’t know the details.
 - Organizational effectiveness does not lie in that narrow minded concept called rationality. It lies in the blend of clearheaded logic and powerful intuition.
 - Data don’t generate theory – only researchers do that.
 - Basically, managing is about influencing action. Managing is about helping organizations and units to get things done, which means action. Sometimes, managers manage actions directly. They fight fires. They manage projects. They negotiate contracts.

 - Anecdotal data is not incidental to theory development at all, but an essential part of it.
 - Technologies tend to undermine community and encourage individualism.
 - If you ask managers what they do, they will most likely tell you that they plan, organise, co-ordinate and control. Then watch what they do. Don’t be surprised if you can’t relate what you see to those four words.
 - I describe management as arts, crafts and science. It is a practice that draws on arts, craft and science and there is a lot of craft – meaning experience – there is a certain amount of craft meaning insight, creativity and vision, and there is the use of science, technique or analysis.
 - Management is a curious phenomenon. It is generously paid, enormously influential, and significantly devoid of common sense.
 - We’re all flawed, but basically, effective managers are people whose flaws are not fatal under the circumstances. Maybe the best managers are simply ordinary, healthy people who aren’t too screwed up.
 - Strategy-making is an immensely complex process involving the most sophisticated, subtle, and at times subconscious of human cognitive and social processes.
 - Strategies grow initially like weeds in a garden, they are not cultivated like tomatoes in a hothouse.

 - We have great managers who havent spent a day in management school. Do we have great surgeons that havent spent a day in surgical school?
 - It is time to recognize conventional MBA programs for what they are – or else to close them down. They are specialized training in the functions of business, not general educating in the practice of management.
 - My feeling about executive bonuses is that any candidate for a chief executive job who even raises the issue of bonuses should be dismissed out of hand.
 - Most of the time, strategies should not be formulating strategy at all; they should be getting on with implementing strategies they already have.
 - An obsession with control generally seems to reflect a fear of uncertainty.
 - A leader has to be one of two things: he either has to be a brilliant visionary himself, a truly creative strategist, in which case he can do what he likes and get away with it; or else he has to be a true empowerer who can bring out the best in others.
 - Corporations are economic entities, to be sure, but they are also social institutions that must justify their existence by their overall contribution to society.
 - The idea that you can take smart but inexperienced 25-year-olds who never managed anything and turn them into effective managers via two years of classroom training is ludicrous.
 - Theory is a dirty word in some managerial quarters. That is rather curious, because all of us, managers especially, can no more get along without theories than libraries can get along without catalogs and for the same reason: theories help us make sense of incoming information.
 - So technologies, whether it is a telephone or an iPhone, computers in general or automobiles, television even, all individualize us. We all sit in front of our iPhones and communicating but are we really communicating?
 - Why does every generation have to think that he lives in the period with the greatest turbulence?
