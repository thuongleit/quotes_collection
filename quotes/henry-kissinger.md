 - There are only two reasons to sit in the back row of an airplane: Either you have diarrhea, or you’re anxious to meet people who do.
 - High office teaches decision making, not substance. It consumes intellectual capital; it does not create it. Most high officials leave office with the perceptions and insights with which they entered; they learn how to make decisions but not what decisions to make.

 - NAFTA represents the single most creative step towards a New World Order.
 - At any rate, mutually assured destruction was never our policy.

 - Donald Rumsfeld is the most ruthless man I have ever met? and I mean that as a compliment.
