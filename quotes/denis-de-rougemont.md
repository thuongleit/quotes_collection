 - Animals do feel like us, also joy, love, fear and pain but they cannot grasp the spoken word. It is our obligation to take their part and continue to resist the people who profit by them, who slaughter them and who torture them.
 - To love in the sense of passion-love is the contrary of to live. It is an impoverishment of oneâ€™s being, an askesis without sequel, an inability to enjoy the present without imagining it as absent, a never-ending flight from possession.
 - Social confusion has now reached a point at which the pursuit of immorality turns out to be more exhausting than compliance with the old moral codes.
