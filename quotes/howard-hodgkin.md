 - I am happy for people to talk about my pictures, but I wish devoutly that I was not expected to talk about them myself.
 - Collecting has been my great extravagance. It’s a way of being. I collect for the same reason that I eat too much-I’m one of nature’s shoppers.
 - In England, it’s thought to be morally suspect to worry about what your surroundings look like.
 - In the United States there has been a kind of a structure in the Modern art world. The New York School was nearly a coherent thing-for a minute.
