 - They are not long, the days of wine and roses. Out of a misty dream, our path emerges for a while, then closes, within a dream.
 - I cried for madder music and for stronger wine...
 - They are not long, the days of wine and roses.
 - I understand that absinthe makes the tart grow fonder.
 - They are not long, the weeping and the laughter. Love and desire and hate; I think they have no portion in us after We pass the gate.
