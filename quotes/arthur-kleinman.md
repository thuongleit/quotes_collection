 - Hope is what makes the human condition liveable.
 - We are storied folk. Stories are what we are; telling and listening to stories is what we do.
 - Stories open up new paths, sometimes send us back to old ones, and close off still others. Telling and listening to stories we too imaginatively walk down those paths â€“ paths of longing, paths of hope, paths of desperation.
