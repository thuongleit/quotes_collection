 - I think the difference between finding happiness, or moments of happiness, is how you choose to interpret things. That’s a rather shocking responsibility. That we’re responsible for our own happiness. It’s not those around us.
 - My grandparents never understood why my mother Noreen chose such exotic names for her children: Damon and me. My granny insisted on calling my brother Dermot – a good Irish name – until she died; I was just known as wee one.
 - Scribbling things down is my therapy. I filter later.
 - I always keep myself busy. I’m writing. Or I’m creating something. Or I’m doing stuff with the kids. I’m up incredibly early in the morning; I go to bed incredibly late at night.
 - Living with very limited expectations is a much more immediate way of living. You really do just make the best of everything you have. I guess kids have that ability; they wait in joyful anticipation of something rather than that sense of entitlement.
 - I feel awful for women who are trying to raise kids on their own, with zero income and no fathers present – that’s single motherhood.
 - I grew up with my stepfather in Brighton, but I did spend a lot of time with my natural father, and I was loved by both, so I suppose the advantage of this was that I wasn’t bound by one set of experiences; I always had an alternative.
 - I’m very different to my mum. I’m not as beautiful as she is, nor – she probably despairs about this – as groomed. I certainly rebelled against her idea of looking well turned-out. I spent several years with a shaved head in jeans and baggy shirts.

 - I have a massive divide between being a competent human being and being completely hopeless, when it comes to logic.
 - I play Nitin Sawhney’s ‘Letting Go’ repeatedly, nonstop. I find it transformative. I’m so glad iPods were invented so I didn’t have to drive everyone around me mad with the repetition.
 - I think it’s incumbent on actresses to bring something else to the part which isn’t in the script.
 - In terms of ‘Solaris,’ I didn’t really think about the religious aspect an awful lot. There’s one scene at a dinner party, and it’s discussed, but it wasn’t an overwhelming theme for me.
 - I always think I love work, and I knew early on that I wanted to be an actress. Then I meet people who have truly dedicated their lives to acting, and I realise that Im so completely in the back seat.
 - My stepfather introduced me to The London Library when I was about 18; the clientele has definitely changed since then, but it is still a wonderful oasis in the middle of London.
 - I happen to find motherhood a very natural state, but I know a lot of other people don’t.
