 - I will not be triumphed over.
 - Be it known that we, the greatest, are misthought.
 - And make death proud to take us.
 - My honour was not yielded, but conquered merely.
 - Fool! Donâ€™t you see now that I could have poisoned you a hundred times had I been able to live without you.
 - All strange and terrible events are welcome, but comforts we despise.
 - In praising Antony I have dispraised Caesar.
 - Leave the fishing-rod, Great General, to us sovereigns of Pharos and Canopus. Your game is cities and kings and continents.
