 - This is strength; this is peace; to feel, in entering on every day, that all its duties and trials have been committed to the Lord Jesus â€“ that, come what may, He will use us for His own glory and our real good!
 - Nothing so clears the vision and lifts up the life, as a decision to move forward in what you know to be entirely the will of the Lord.
 - I had my nearest and most intimate glimpses of the presence of my Lord in those dread moments when musket, club or spear was being levelled at my life.
 - If I die here in Glasgow, I shall be eaten by worms; If I can but live and die serving the Lord Jesus, it will make no difference to me whether I am eaten by cannibals or by worms; for in the Great Day my resurrection body will arise as fair as yours in the likeness of our risen Redeemer.
