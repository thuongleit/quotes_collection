 - When you’re dead, you’re dead. No one is going to remember me when I’m dead. Oh maybe a few friends will remember me affectionately. Being remembered isn’t the most important thing anyhow. It’s what you do when you are here that’s important.
 - My life is fair game for anybody. I spent an unhappy, penniless childhood in Brooklyn. I had to slug my way up in a town called Hollywood where people love to trample you to death. I don’t relax because I don’t know how. I don’t want to know how. Life is too short to relax.
 - You’re beautiful in your wrath.
 - I never thought of myself as a movie star. I’m just a working girl. A working girl who worked her way to the top – and never fell off.
 - I defy any newcomer not to believe his or her publicity at the very beginning. It’s only natural. At least it was for me.
