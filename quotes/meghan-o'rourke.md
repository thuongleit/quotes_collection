 - The truth is, I need to experience my mother’s presence in the world around me and not just in my head.
 - Funerals cost so much money, and are likely to be an additional source of stress in this recession – it’s sad that we don’t have a more humane, less commercialized way to approach burial.
 - To mourn is to wonder at the strangeness that grief is not written all over your face in bruised hieroglyphics. And it’s also to feel, quite powerfully, that you’re not allowed to descend into the deepest fathom of your grief – that to do so would be taboo somehow.
