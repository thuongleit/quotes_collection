 - Humans are pattern-seeking story-telling animals, and we are quite adept at telling stories about patterns, whether they exist or not.
 - Science is not a thing. It’s a verb. It’s a way of thinking about things. It’s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
 - Smart people believe weird things because they are skilled at defending beliefs they arrived at for non-smart reasons.
 - Science is the best tool ever devised for understanding how the world works.
 - I’m a skeptic not because I do not want to believe, but because I want to know. How can we tell the difference between what we would like to be true and what is actually true? The answer is science.

 - Absolute morality leads logically to absolute intolerance.
 - In principle, skeptics are neither closed-minded nor cynical. We are curious but cautious.

 - Skepticism is not a position; it’s a process.
 - Myths are stories that express meaning, morality or motivation. Whether they are true or not is irrelevant.
 - In science, all conclusions are provisional, subject to new evidence and better arguments, the very antithesis of religious faith.
 - In the past 10,000 years, humans have devised roughly 100,000 religions based on roughly 2,500 gods. So the only difference between myself and the believers is that I am skeptical of 2,500 gods whereas they are skeptical of 2,499 gods. We’re only one God away from total agreement.
 - The human capacity for self-delusion is boundless, and the effects of belief are overpowering.

 - The whole point of faith, in fact, is to believe regardless of the evidence, which is the very antithesis of science.
 - It is sad that while science moves ahead in exciting new areas of research, fine-tuning our knowledge of how life originated and evolved, creationists remain mired in medieval debates about angels on the head of a pin and animals in the belly of an Ark.
 - Belief is the natural state of things. It is the default option. We just believe. We believe all sorts of things. Belief is natural; disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.

 - The reason is that in a group, individual errors on either side of the true figure cancel each other out.
 - We’re all talking about the same thing, whether it’s religious people or New Age spiritual people or Buddhists or scientists. We’re all talking about having a sense of awe and wonder at something grander than ourselves.
 - I care what is actually true, even more than what I hope is true.
 - If spirituality is the sense of awe and humility in the face of the creation, what could be more awesome and humbling than the deep space discovered by Hubble and the cosmologists, and the deep time discovered by Darwin and the evolutionists.
