 - No rain but thunder, and the sound of giants.
 - But if there must be an end, let it be loud. Let it be bloody. Better to burn than to wither away in the dark.
 - Don’t mess with me, lady. I’ve been drinking with skeletons.
 - Since the beginning of the world, a prayer is a prayer and a curse is a curse – no matter the people – no matter the language – Man has given a thousand different namesto his god, but look into the face of each one – long enough – hard enough – You will find one truth.
 - Okay, I know I said I wasn’t going to shake things up, but we’re going to have to get some pants on this one.
