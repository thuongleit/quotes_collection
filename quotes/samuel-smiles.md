 - Sow a thought, and you reap an act; Sow an act, and you reap a habit; Sow a habit, and you reap a character; Sow a character, and you reap a destiny.
 - We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.

 - Self-control is only courage under another form.
 - Hope is like the sun, which, as we journey toward it, casts the shadow of our burden behind us.

 - All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. But all play and no work makes him something worse.
 - The great leader attracts to himself men of kindred character, drawing them towards him as the loadstone draws iron.
 - The very greatest things – great thoughts, discoveries, inventions – have usually been nurtured in hardship, often pondered over in sorrow, and at length established with difficulty.
 - The battle of life is, in most cases, fought uphill; and to win it without a struggle were perhaps to win it without honor. If there were no difficulties there would be no success; if there were nothing to struggle for, there would be nothing to be achieved.
 - The spirit of self-help is the root of all genuine growth in the individual.
 - He who never made a mistake, never made a discovery.

 - It is the close observation of little things which is the secret of success in business, in art, in science, and in every pursuit of life.

 - Lost wealth may be replaced by industry, lost knowledge by study, lost health by temperance or medicine, but lost time is gone forever.

 - Example teaches better than precept. It is the best modeler of the character of men and women. To set a lofty example is the richest bequest a man can leave behind him.

 - Men whose acts are at variance with their words command no respect, and what they say has but little weight.
 - Good sense, disciplined by experience and inspired by goodness, issues in practical wisdom.
 - A woman’s best qualities do not reside in her intellect, but in her affections. She gives refreshment by her sympathies, rather than by her knowledge.
 - Men who are resolved to find a way for themselves will always find opportunities enough; and if they do not find them, they will make them.
 - The experience gathered from books, though often valuable, is but the nature of learning; whereas the experience gained from actual life is one of the nature of wisdom.
 - I see nothing quite conclusive in the art of temporal government, But violence, duplicity and frequent malversation. King rules or barons rule: The strong man strongly and the weak man by caprice. They have but one law, to seize the power and keep it.
 - Obedience, submission, discipline, courage – these are among the characteristics which make a man.
 - Practical wisdom is only to be learned in the school of experience. Precepts and instruction are useful so far as they go, but, without the discipline of real life, they remain of the nature of theory only.
 - Time is of no account with great thoughts. They are as fresh today as when they first passed through their author’s minds, ages ago.
 - The great high-road of human welfare lies along the old highway of steadfast, well-doing; and they who are the most persistent, and work in the truest spirit, will invariably be the most successful; success treads on the heels of every right effort.

 - The noble people will be nobly ruled, and the ignorant and corrupt ignobly.
 - Sympathy is the golden key that unlocks the hearts of others.

 - The duty of helping one’s self in the highest sense involves the helping of one’s neighbors.

 - The truest politeness comes of sincerity.
 - Alexander the Great valued learning so highly, that he used to say he was more indebted to Aristotle for giving him knowledge than to his father Philip for life.

 - An intense anticipation itself transforms possibility into reality; our desires being often but precursors of the things which we are capable of performing.
 - Life will always be to a large extent what we ourselves make it.

 - Energy of will may be defined to be the very central power of character in a man.
 - Great men are always exceptional men; and greatness itself is but comparative. Indeed, the range of most men in life is so limited that very few have the opportunity of being great.
 - Luck lies in bed, and wishes the postman would bring him news of a legacy; labor turns out at six, and with busy pen or ringing hammer lays the foundation of a competence.
 - The government of a nation itself is usually found to be but the reflux of the individuals composing it. The government that is ahead of the people will be inevitably dragged down to their level, as the government that is behind them will in the long run be dragged up.

 - Character is undergoing constant change, for better or for worse – either being elevated on the one hand, or degraded on the other.
