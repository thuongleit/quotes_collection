 - Globalisation has made us more vulnerable. It creates a world without borders, and makes us painfully aware of the limitations of our present instruments, and of politics, to meet its challenges.
 - Firstly, economic globalisation has brought prosperity and development to many countries, but also financial crises to Asia, Latin America and Russia, and increasing poverty and marginalisation.
 - Human rights are praised more than ever – and violated as much as ever.
 - The WTO has one of the most impressive records in global economic governance, by promoting trade liberalisation and economic development.
 - Globalisation makes it clear that social responsibility is required not only of governments, but of companies and individuals. All sources must interact in order to reach the MDGs.
 - The globalisation of information makes people aware of what they have – and have not. Problems and oppression are impossible to hide, and the new and powerful tools of information provide us with more opportunities than ever to react and act.
 - Developed countries and advanced developing countries must open their markets for products from the developing world, and support in developing their export and import capacity.
 - We need a reform of the Security Council. It must be perceived as truly representative by all the 191 member states, to uphold the credibility and legitimacy of the UN as the main political arena.
 - Global markets must be balanced by global values such as respect for human rights and international law, democracy, security and sustainable economic and environmental development.
 - The world is richer than ever, and the gaps between rich and poor are wider.
 - Terrorism can never be accepted. We must fight it together, with methods that do not compromise our respect for the rule of law and human rights, or are used as an excuse for others to do so.
 - The United Nations remains our most important global actor. These days we are continuously reminded of the enormous responsibility of the Security Council to uphold international peace and stability.
 - The developing countries must be able to take a more active part in trade negotiations, through technical assistance and support from the developed countries.
 - Poverty does not make people terrorists, but terrorists can exploit the frustration it creates and use it as a breeding-ground for violent ideas.
 - One of the gaps in our international development efforts is the provision of global public goods – that is, goods or conditions we need that no individual or country can secure on their own, such as halting global warming, financial stability and peace and security.
 - Still, corruption and oppression are far too common threats to the democratic society.
 - We urge President Bush to abstain from the National Missile Defense, just as we urge China, India and Pakistan to discontinue their nuclear arsenals.
 - The most important issue we have to deal with is freedom of movement.
 - To properly reflect the changes of the world and of the UN, with its growing number of member states, we would like to see an enlargement of the SC that gives room for new members, not least developing countries.
 - We need the UN, to deal with the threats to our common security from nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, not only in the case of Iraq. They must be tackled by the international community together, by strengthening conventions, treaties and agreements.
 - Regional exchange can be a source of growth and development, and of enhancing good governance.
 - We need new partnerships in fighting terrorism and building peace.
 - States have the responsibility to create rules and conditions for growth and development, and to channel the benefits to all citizens by providing education and making people able to participate in the economies, and in decision-making.
 - Poverty must be reduced not only for reasons of moral and justice, but also of security.
 - In a case like Iraq the UN has again shown what important role it plays as the guarantor for protecting international peace and stability in the global political structure.
 - That was for instance the case in Mocambique a couple of years ago, during the flooding catastrophe. Instead of co-ordinating assistance properly, to much time and resources was spent on fighting about the same helicopters and local guides.
