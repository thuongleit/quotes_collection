 - This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

 - Keep it simple, make it general, and make it intelligible.
 - Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.
