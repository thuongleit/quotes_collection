 - I see myself being 5 times hotter than I am now every year. I just focus on being hotter than the year before.
 - I always say if you can’t buy it three times over, you can’t afford it. Don’t drive a Bentley on a Benz income.
 - It was mix tapes, that’s my story, I did a lot of mix tapes, that’s what I started doing when I was 17. I got with a hot DJ out here and you know Texas, the rap scene is different, everyone out here is on the Screw music.
