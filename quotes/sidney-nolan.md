 - Painting is an extension of man’s means of communication. As such, it’s pure, difficult, and wonderful.
 - One ends up with a landscape one has never seen before but it is presumably the landscape you were feeling as you started the painting.
 - Love slowly like a ship full of flowers.
 - When the critics come around it’s always too late.
 - I’m compelled and dedicated to transmitting emotions and I care for very little else.
