 - I really would not change anything. Have a passion for what you do, work hard, have great people with good personalities, enjoy the ride.
 - Some family trees bear an enormous crop of nuts.
 - I’m not leaving until you say yes.
 - My father always said working for somebody else never amounted to anything. You have to be an entrepreneur.
 - I’m going to miss Blockbuster. I’m gonna miss being CEO and all that stuff. We had an atmosphere where everybody was happy. When people make money, they’re happy.
