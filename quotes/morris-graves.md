 - I paint to evoke a changing language of symbols, a language with which to remark upon the qualities of our mysterious capacities which direct us towards the ultimate reality.
 - It may not always be obvious at first, but I think that everyone can make a valuable contribution if only they put their minds to it.
 - It takes waking prayer and working prayer and going to bed in prayer each day with increasing dedication. I must be the best person that I am able to be when I am painting. Tonight the wind is howling and the barrels are full of sky water.
 - Such compositions, line and color ideas, such wonders come into my mind and have stuck! – They will this time be dismissed only by being painted out...
 - I paint to rest from the phenomena of the external world – to pronounce it – and to make notations of its essences with which to verify the inner eye.
 - The painting cannot be laid aside even for a day; for it takes constant work to keep ‘flowing,’ but above that it takes concentration, which in our language is consecration.
