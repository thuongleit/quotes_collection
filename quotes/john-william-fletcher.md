 - Calamity is man’s true touchstone.
 - To work a fell revenge a man’s a fool, if not instructed in a woman’s school.
 - Fanaticism is the child of false zeal and of superstition, the father of intolerance and of persecution.
 - Deeds, not words shall speak to me.
 - Leap hearts to lips, and in our kisses meet.
 - Vice gets more in this vicious world than piety.
