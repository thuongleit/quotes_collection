 - Follow your heart, and listen when it speaks to you.
 - But in order to be strong, you have to love yourself, and in order to love yourself, you need thorough self-knowledge, you need to know everything about yourself, including your most hidden secrets, the ones most difficult to accept.
 - Love doesn’t suit the lazy; sometimes it requires strong, precise actions.

 - The love withheld is always the love we long for most.
 - To make mistakes is natural, but to go to one’s grave without having understood them is to make life a pointless exercise.
