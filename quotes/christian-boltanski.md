 - We all die twice – once when we actually die and once when no one on earth recognizes our photograph.
 - Art-making is not about telling the truth but making the truth felt.
 - We’re painting the same people all our life – it’s just the way we look at them that changes. If you experience trauma, you can speak about it in so many different ways. You can speak about landscape, you can speak about your food; it’s always different. Trauma is the beginning of life as an artist.
 - When I was four or five years old, I heard a lot of stories about the Holocaust because both my parents were survivors. I’m sure that was very important in my life. My father snuck out from under the floorboards to make love to my mother. I can’t imagine why they kept me.
 - I think that all human activity is stupid. Artistic activity is also stupid, but you can see it more clearly.
 - The photo replaces the memory. When someone dies, after a while you can’t visualize them anymore, you only remember them through their pictures.
 - Photography is used to give evidence, and the evidence is always deceiving.
 - I’ve filled my whole life trying to preserve the memory of living, in the fight against dying. Perhaps the only thing I’ve done, since stopping death is impossible, is to show this fight. The fight itself does not satisfy us either.
 - I like looking at the finger of God. Why it takes one and not another, why this one or that one, why now or why then. The finger of God is always on us. When you get older and you see your friends dying around you, you say “Why not me?” That machine is always there.
 - The science about life is very optimistic. Every second, four people in the world die, and six are born. This is optimistic.
 - I never take photographs myself. I don’t feel like a photographer, more like a recycler.
 - I was lucky to be born during the time of minimalism. I think I can be colder because of this. In form I speak with minimalism but my feeling is sentimental – I am a sentimental minimalist.
 - There are very few times in creation in your life. One time is when you become an adult, one time is when your parents die, and the other time is when you are very old.
 - You are what you are because your parents made love at that exact moment, and if they made love one second after you would be different.
 - In most of my photographic pieces I have manipulated the quality of the evidence that people assign to photography, in order to subvert it, or to show that photography lies – that what it conveys is not reality but a set of cultural codes.
 - The fact that you were born means that there are no other children born because of you – you’ve killed them in a way.
