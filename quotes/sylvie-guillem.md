 - Having limits to push against is how you find out what you can do.
 - Technical perfection is insufficient. It is an orphan without the true soul of the dancer.
 - Having limits to push against is how you find out what you can do. I have always been full of contradictions. I am shy but I love the freedom of the stage. I need reassurance but at the same time I don’t want it. I hate being afraid but I can’t help wanting to frighten myself. That is how you grow.
 - My body is very nice to me. I have a lucky physique – I just don’t take weight on.
 - No, dance is not a monster. The stage is monstrous, not in the negative sense but on the grandiose side. And dance is sacred as something emotionally strong happens.
 - When I was very young I was very shy but at the same time I was very open cause I was very curious so I wanted to try many things.
 - I just know that when I go onstage, I give everything I have, not only my feet, not only my legs, not only my body. I try to tell a story. Sometimes I am able to cry because I feel like it. Sometimes I am able to love because I feel like it.
