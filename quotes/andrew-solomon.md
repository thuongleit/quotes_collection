 - The opposite of depression is not happiness, but vitality, and it was vitality that seemed to seep away from me in that moment.
 - When you banish the dragons you banish the heroes.
 - Depression is the flaw in love. There’s no such thing as love without the anticipation of loss. And that specter of despair can be the engine of intimacy.

 - It is nearly impossible to hate anyone whose story you know.
 - Grief is depression in proportion to circumstance; depression is grief out of proportion to circumstance.
 - Our needs are our greatest asset. It turns out I’ve learned to give all the things that I need.
 - The absence of words is the absence of intimacy. There are experiences that are starved for language.
 - I don’t accept subtractive models of love, only additive ones. And I believe that in the same way we need species diversity to ensure that the planet can go on, so we need this diversity of affection and diversity of family in order to strengthen the ecosphere of kindness.
 - Living with depression is like trying to keep your balance while you dance with a goat – it is perfectly sane to prefer a partner with a better sense of balance.
 - One of the things that frequently gets lost in descriptions of depression is that the depressed person often knows that it is a ludicrous condition to feel so disabled by the ordinary business of quotidian life.
 - Listen to the people who love you. Believe that they are worth living for even when you don’t believe it.
 - We live in the right time, even if it doesn’t always feel like it.
 - We don’t seek the painful experiences that hew our identities, but we seek our identities in the wake of painful experiences.
 - The experience of being depressed and emerging from depression made me understand the idea of a soul. I felt that the language in which one could best acknowledge that drew from faith.
 - Oppression breeds the power to oppose it.
 - Some people are trapped by the belief that love comes in finite quantities, and that our kind of love exhausts the supply upon which they need to draw. I do not accept competitive models of love, only additive ones.
 - You don’t think in depression that you’ve put on a gray veil and are seeing the world through the haze of a bad mood. You think that the veil has been taken away, the veil of happiness, and that now you’re seeing truly.
 - Your gender identity is who you are. Sexual identity is who you bounce that off of.
 - Fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph.

 - Loving our own children is an exercise for the imagination.
 - Life is enriched by difficulty; love is made more acute when it requires exertion.
 - Kids with Down syndrome are, by and large, quite affectionate and relatively guileless, and frequently, the attachments to them grow and deepen. And the meaning that parents find in it grows and deepens.
 - I believe that words are strong, that they can overwhelm what we fear when fear seems more awful than life is good.
 - Identity itself should be not a smug label or a gold medal but a revolution.
 - That, in essence, is the catastrophe of suicide for those who survive: not only the loss of someone, but the loss of the chance to persuade that person to act differently, the loss of the chance to connect.
 - Grief is depression in proportion to circumstance; depression is grief out of proportion to circumstance. It is tumbleweed distress that thrives on thin air, growing despite its detachment from the nourishing earth. It can be described only in metaphor and allegory.
 - Ease makes less of an impression on us than struggle.
 - I’m not studying everything that can go wrong. What I’m studying is how much love there can be, even when everything appears to be going wrong.
 - If you are married and you go off and have an affair with someone, if you are a husband who does that, it may potentially hurt your wife enormously. But it seems to me likely also to compromise your marriage. That seems to me to be a harm.
 - A sense of humor is the best indicator that you will recover; it is often the best indicator that people will love you. Sustain that and you have hope.
 - When you believe that you cannot stitch your own heart back together, go to work on the hearts of other people; there is no surer way to repair yourself than to repair them.
 - There is a line that I always loved from Lucretius. He said, “The sublime is the art of exchanging easier for more difficult pleasures.” The presumption of that formulation is that the more difficult pleasures are actually better than the easier pleasures. That is why one makes the exchange.
 - You need to take the traumas and make them part of who you’ve come to be, and you need to fold the worst events of your life into a narrative of triumph, evincing a better self in response to things that hurt.
 - I think a lot of the time people assume that their values are universal. And they don’t understand which aspects of their values are actually universal and which aspects are very specific.

 - Treating an identity as an illness invites real illness to make a braver stand.
 - Being in a marriage and having children is the greatest pleasure, but it is certainly not the easiest pleasure. It is not like eating ice cream.

 - Science still won’t explain the mysterious nature of love and despair.
 - Depression is the flaw in love. To be creatures who love, we must be creatures who can despair at what we lose, and depression is the mechanism of that despair.
 - Labeling a child’s mind as diseased-whether with autism, intellectual disabilities, or transgenderism-may reflect the discomfort that mind gives parents more than any discomfort it causes their child. Much gets corrected that might better have been left alone.

 - It is easy to keep secrets by being honest in an ironic tone of voice.
 - I just look at my own life, which is full of error as all life is. I have done plenty of things that I am not proud of.
 - There is a tendency to dehumanize kids that commit crimes. The system is focused on punishment, not on rehabilitation. These kids are the most misunderstood and most cruelly treated.

 - I believe that organized religion is an ornament to the truth, and that aesthetics are part of its power.
 - Fixing is the illness model; acceptance is the identity model; which way any family goes reflects their assumptions and resources.
 - Sometimes, people end up thankful for what they mourned. You cannot achieve this state by seeking tragedy, but you can keep yourself open more to sorrow’s richness than to unmediated despair. Tragedies with happy endings may be sentimental tripe, or they may be the true meaning of love.
 - Depressed people cannot lead a revolution because depressed people can barely manage to get out of bed and put on their shoes and socks.
 - There is neither a cure for nor a way to repair autism. There is no implant like there is for the deaf.

 - I think what the Church should ideally do, and does appear to do in the context of straight relationships, is to support people in crossing from the easier pleasure of momentary carnal satisfaction, into the more difficult pleasure of love and family and relationship.
 - The idea of anyone contemplating our family and witnessing the affection that we all have for one another and seeing evil in it is deeply hurtful and sad; and also deeply bewildering.

 - I’m a huge believer in science. But I don’t think it explains everything.
