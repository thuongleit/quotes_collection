 - America! America! God shed His grace on thee.
 - Adversity is the true school of the mind.
 - 0 beautiful for patriot dream That sees beyond the years Thine alabaster cities gleam Undimmed by human tears! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea!
 - Love planted a rose, and the world turned sweet.
 - It is the hour to rend thy chains, The blossom time of souls.
 - The life of Liverpool is commerce; it is a city of warehouses and shops.
