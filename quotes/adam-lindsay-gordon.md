 - Life is mostly froth and bubble, Two things stand like stone. Kindness in another’s trouble, Courage in your own.
 - Don’t worry about people from your past there’s a reason why they didn’t make it to your future.
 - There comes a point in your life when you realize: Who matters, Who never did, Who won’t anymore, And who always will. So, don’t worry about people from your past, there’s a reason why they didn’t make it to your future.
 - Life is mostly froth and bubble.
 - For good undone, and gifts misspent, and resolutions vain.
 - In a thousand years we shall all forget The things that trouble us now.
