 - God is never too late, nor too early, but just on time.
 - God is predictably unpredictable.
 - Love is a choice. Total forgiveness is a choice. It is not a feeling-at least at first-but is rather an act of the will. It is the choice to tear up the record of wrongs we have been keeping.
 - God made only one you and He threw the mold away.
 - The power of the Holy Spirit cannot be successfully duplicated. If a person is supernaturally changed and given a love for God’s glory, God did it.
 - The ultimate proof of total forgiveness takes place when we sincerely petition the Father to let those who have hurt us off the hook – even if they have hurt not only us, but also those close to us.
 - The more conscious of God’s presence the more I feel like being myself, the less conscious of His presence, the more I feel I need to prove myself.
 - A full relationship is what God offers to those who come to God by Jesus. Imagine this! An open invitation to become a member of the royal family and a joint-heir with the Son of God.
 - The happiest pillow on which you may rest your head is the knowledge of God’s will. I cannot imagine a more miserable situation than consciously to be out of God’s will.
 - When the Spirit is absent, our excuses always seem right, but in the presence of the Spirit our excuses fade away.
 - You are probably at your sanest when you come to the place where you abandon all else but your desire for God.
 - I want to inspire people to desire to see the praise that comes from the one and only true God. Above all else. That is what God has laid on my heart and the message that I bring to you.
