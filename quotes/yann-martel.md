 - I suppose in the end, the whole of life becomes an act of letting go, but what always hurts the most is not taking a moment to say goodbye.
 - You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it.
 - To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.
 - My life is like a memento mori painting from European art: there is always a grinning skull at my side to remind me of the folly of human ambition.
 - I have a story that will make you believe in God.
 - Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, he was watching. Even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering, he was watching. And when I was beyond all hope of saving, he gave me rest. Then he gave me a sign to continue my journey.
 - I can only tell my story, what you believe is up to you.
 - How long does it take for a broken spirit to kill a body that has food, water and shelter?
 - Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can. But life leaps over oblivion lightly, losing only a thing or two of no importance, and gloom is but the passing shadow of a cloud...
 - When you’ve suffered a great deal in life, each additional pain is both unbearable and trifling.
 - It is simple and brutal: a person can get used to anything, even to killing.
 - If you don’t have dreams, how do you maneuver reality? Where do you get the ideas to change reality if not from dreams?
 - There is nothing more satisfying than having a sentence fall into place in a way you feel is right, and then adding another one and then another one. It’s extraordinarily satisfying.
 - If we, citizens, do not support our artists, then we sacrifice our imagination on the altar of crude reality and we end up believing in nothing and having worthless dreams.
 - Afterwards, when it’s all over, you meet God. What do you say to God?
 - I challenge anyone to understand Islam, its spirit, and not to love it. It is a beautiful religion of brotherhood and devotion.
 - Work, work, work, but what mark do we leave, what point do we make? People who are too beholden to work become like erasers: as things move forward, they leave in their wake no trace of themselves.
 - Faith in God is an opening up, a letting go, a deep trust, a free act of love – but sometimes it was so hard to love.
 - Reality is how we interpret it. Imagination and volition play a part in that interpretation. Which means that all reality is to some extent a fiction.
 - It is true that those we meet can change us, sometimes so profoundly that we are not the same afterwards, even unto our names.
 - Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart.
 - All living things contain a measure of madness that moves them in strange, sometimes inexplicable ways. This madness can be saving; it is part and parcel of the ability to adapt. Without it, no species would survive.
 - I love cinema. I think the risk of the aesthetics being fixed is compensated by other advantages. Cinema is visually powerful, it is a complete experience, reaches different audience. It’s something I really like. I like movies.
 - The animals might embody certain traits. We think of tigers as being ferocious, etc. But to my mind, it was the other way around: the humans embodied certain animal traits.
 - Bapu Gandhi said, ‘All religions are true.’ I just want to love God.
 - I love Canada. Its a wonderful political act of faith that exists atop a breathtakingly beautiful land.
 - I did not count the days or the weeks or the months. Time is an illusion that only makes us pant. I survived because I forgot even the very notion of time.
 - To me, religion is about our dignity, not our depravity.
 - Fanatics do not have faith – they have belief. With faith you let go. You trust. Whereas with belief you cling.
 - That’s what fiction is about, isn’t it, the selective transforming of reality? The twisting of it to bring out its essence?
 - As much as I love movies, it would be presumptuous of me to think that I know how to make one.
 - He’s a shy man. Life has taught him not to show off what is most precious to him.
 - If you stumble about believability, what are you living for? Love is hard to believe, ask any lover. Life is hard to believe, ask any scientist. God is hard to believe, ask any believer. What is your problem with hard to believe?
 - It’s important in life to conclude things properly. Only then can you let go. Otherwise you are left with words you should have said but never did, and your heart is heavy with remorse.
 - The reason death sticks so closely to life isn’t biological necessity – it’s envy.
 - Don’t you bully me with your politeness!
 - Words are much better at relating emotions and thoughts.
 - If literature does one thing, it makes you more empathetic by making you live other lives and feel the pain of others. Ideologues don’t feel the pain of others because they haven’t imaginatively got under their skins.
 - As for hearing, the sloth is not so much deaf as uninterested in sound.
 - Life is an interpretation of a series of facts, and that interpretation is really what life is about. So the division between non-fiction and fiction has a certain logic, but it’s a very limited one. And by and large, it isn’t helpful.
 - Art is the suitcase of history, carrying the essentials. Art is the life buoy of history. Art is seed, art is memory, art is vaccine.
 - Books, like people, can’t be reduced to the cost of the materials with which they were made. Books, like people, become unique and precious once you get to know them.
 - Life on a lifeboat isn’t much of a life.
 - The lower you are, the higher your mind will want to soar.
 - My gratitude to him is as boundless as the Pacific ocean.
 - You might think I lost all hope at that point. I did. And as a result I perked up and felt much better.
 - A realization that the founding principle of existence is what we call love, which works itself out sometimes not clearly, not cleanly, not immediately, nonetheless ineluctably.
 - My suffering left me sad and gloomy.
 - Life on a lifeboat isn’t much of a life. It is like an end game in chess, a game with few pieces. The elements couldn’t be more simple, nor the stakes higher.
 - Religion is more than rite and ritual.
 - If there’s only one nation in the sky, shouldn’t all passports be valid for it?
 - We think we live in a global village. We don’t. The world is a big and beautiful and incredibly varied place. It can only be known locally, with your two feet on the ground. We should stick to our own gardens, as Voltaire said.
 - I’m not a consumer. I hate buying clothes. I don’t have a mobile. I just don’t need things. I don’t like things.
 - India is a place where all stories are possible. You forget that the imagination can take hold of anything and contemplate it and love it and describe it.
 - You can get used to anything – haven’t I already said that? Isn’t that what all survivors say?
 - I have nothing to say of my working life, only that a tie is a noose, and inverted though it is, it will hang a man nonetheless if he’s not careful.
 - I know what you want. You want a story that won’t surprise you. That will confirm what you already know. That won’t make you see higher or further or differently. You want a flat story. An immobile story. You want dry, yeastless factuality.
 - Misery loves company, and madness calls it forth.
 - Blessed be shock. Blessed be the part of us that protects us from too much pain and sorrow. At the heart of life is a fusebox.
 - Hindus, in their capacity for love, are indeed hairless Christians, just as Muslims, in the way they see God in everything, are bearded Hindus, and Christians, in their devotion to God, are hat wearing Muslims.
 - Jesus, Mary, Muhammad and Vishnu, how good to see you Richard Parker!
 - Atheists are my brothers and sisters of a different faith, and every word they speak speaks of faith. Like me, they go as far as the legs of reason will carry them – and then they leap.
 - Stories – individual stories, family stories, national stories – are what stitch together the disparate elements of human existence into a coherent whole. We are story animals.
 - Fiction and nonfiction are not so easily divided. Fiction may not be real, but it’s true; it goes beyond the garland of facts to get to emotional and psychological truths.
 - Artists invent things as a way of telling the truth.
 - The presence of God is the finest of rewards.
 - Quickly you make rash decisions. You dismiss your last allies: hope and trust. There, you’ve defeated yourself. Fear, which is but an impression, has triumphed over you.
 - My greatest wish – other than salvation – was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One I could read again and again, with new eyes and a fresh understanding each time.
 - Books are something social – a writer speaking to a reader – so I think making the reading of a book the center of a social event, the meeting of a book club, is a brilliant idea.
 - Was it the forgetfulness of old age or personal incapacity that made the man able to say please but not thank you?
 - If you are pitched into misery, remember that your days on this earth are counted and you might as well make the best of those you have left.
 - I find that movies tend to fix the aesthetics of a story in people’s minds.
 - Just do it. Get it down on the page. Work hard. And then let go. Ask yourself why you want to write. You have to be clear about that.
 - It’s amazing how willpower can build walls.
 - Everything was screaming: the sea, the wind, my heart.
 - I couldn’t get Him out of my head. Still can’t. I spent three solid days thinking about Him. The more He bothered me, the less I coul forget Him. And the more I learned about Him, the less I wanted to leave Him.
 - I wish I could convey the perfection of a seal slipping into water or a spider monkey swinging from point to point or a lion merely turning its head. But language founders in such seas. Better to picture it in your head if you want to feel it.
 - When your own life is threatened, your sense of empathy is blunted by a terrible, selfish hunger for survival.
 - First wonder goes deepest; wonder after that fits in the impression made by the first.
 - High calls low and low calls high. I tell you, if you were in such dire straits as I was, you too would elevate your thoughts. The lower you are, the higher your mind will want to soar.
 - My zoology thesis was a functional analysis of the thyroid gland of the three-toed sloth. I chose the sloth because its demeanour – calm, quiet and introspective – did something to soothe my shattered self.
 - I thought they were helping me. I was so full of trust in them that I felt grateful as they carried me in the air. Only when they threw me overboard did I begin to have doubts.
 - It was as unbelievable as the moon catching fire.
 - Life is a peephole, a single tiny entry onto a vastness – how can I not dwell on this brief, cramped view of things? This peephole is all I’ve got!
 - At moments of wonder, it is easy to avoid small thinking, to entertain thoughts that span the universe, that capture both thunder and tinkle, thick and thin, the near and the far.
 - We are all born like Catholics, aren’t we – in limbo, without religion, until some figure introduces us to God?
 - The blackness would stir and eventually go away, and God would remain, a shining point of light in my heart. I would go on loving.
 - The reason death sticks so closely to life isn’t biological necessity; it’s envy. Life is so beautiful that death has fallen in love with it, a jealous, possessive love that grabs at what it can.
 - Life will defend itself no matter how small it is.
 - It is a vast country, so that inspires you. It’s also the greatest hotel on earth: It welcomes people from everywhere. It’s a good country to write from because in many ways Canada is the world.
 - Gloom is but a shadow of a cloud passing by.
 - Much hostile and aggressive behaviour among animals is the expression of social insecurity.
 - My feelings can perhaps be imagined, but they can hardly be described.
 - Scientists are a friendly, atheistic, hard-working, beer-drinking lot whose minds are preoccupied with sex, chess and baseball when they are not preoccupied with science.
 - It is pointless to say that this or that night was the worst of my life. I have so many bad nights to choose from that I’ve made none the champion.
 - Survival starts by paying attention to what is close at hand and immediate. To look out with idle hope is tantamount to dreaming one’s life away.
 - If Christ spent an anguished night in prayer, if He burst out from the Cross, ‘My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?’ then surely we are also permitted doubt. But we must move on. To choose doubt as a philosophy of life is akin to choosing immobility as a means of transportation.
 - Can there be any happiness greater than the happiness of salvation?
 - My alarm clock during my childhood was a pride of lions.
 - How do you live with evil? Art is traditionally – certainly with my secular background – the answer, but art is very self-referential, whereas religion claims to go beyond the bounds of human existence.

 - In my youth, it was my good luck to have a few good teachers, men and women, who came into my head and lit a match.
 - I know zoos are no longer in people’s good graces. Religion faces the same problem. Certain illusions about freedom plague them both.
 - Just as art brings you to another place, so does religion – and to ask questions of factuality tends to reduce both. If you say you were inspired by a novel, that implies that your book is a work of fiction.
 - Mockery be damned, my urine looked delicious.
 - If you stumble at mere believability, what are you living for? Isn’t love hard to believe?
