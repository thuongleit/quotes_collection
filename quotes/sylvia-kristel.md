 - As a painter you’re responsible yourself, 100 percent. In film, you have the editor, the director, the other actors. It has the advantage of not being solitary.
 - I have a talent for happiness. I look with the eyes of a painter, and I see beauty.
 - I don’t expect too much from the afterlife, I think that I know very well what pain is. When I think of the end of my life, I think mainly: I didn’t do nothing, but I could have done more.
 - The only thing I was trying to portray was serenity. Also, innocence, vulnerability and elegance.
 - You’re much better off as a love goddess to die around the age of 40.
 - Men still assume I must be like the girl I played in ‘Emmanuelle.’ John Wayne was never accused of killing people during his free time, but I’m forever stuck with the image of ‘Emmanuelle.’ The truth is, I should have got an Oscar for that role because I’m nothing like that woman.
 - I love to invent – avoiding the truth. I need to dramatize.
 - I still have agents in France, Los Angeles and Amsterdam who call and suggest parts. I’d love to keep on doing both painting and acting until the end of my days.
 - The film was made in 1973. It was a golden time for people to experiment without risking, for example, AIDS. Today one has to be so much more careful and I don’t think a character like that could exist now.
 - Back then I didn’t think a woman like that, or a relationship like that, could exist with complete freedom and no jealousy or possessiveness. I thought it sounded too good to be true and I was certainly convinced it wasn’t the life for me!
 - I have to be careful not to be too proud in life, because there is always room for improvement.
 - I’m very glad to have something to be passionate about. I can’t imagine a life without passion.
 - Self confidence for me is a fragile fleece.
 - I like this other world, this forgetting of myself. The actor works in order to escape, not to find himself. You become an actor by leaving yourself, and then you have to keep acting. How tragic!
 - My mother was Protestant, and in her mind life was more about work and obligations and responsibilities.
 - Of course it’s difficult to top a box office success like Emmanuelle, so it will always be my most important work. But that’s nothing to be ashamed of.
