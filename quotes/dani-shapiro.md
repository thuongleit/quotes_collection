 - From spiritual connection springs kindness, connection, social activism, and love.

 - In my life as a wife and mother, I’m always conscious of my desire to be present.
 - I’ve always felt like my nose is pressed to glass. I always feel a little bit like an outsider.

 - If you write memoir, it can’t be about blame or hurt; it has to be creative.
 - Strange – I’m not much of a film person. I love watching films, but they don’t stay with me the way books do. Stranger still, because my husband is a screenwriter!
 - There’s something about urban life – you walk out your door, and you’re in a steady of stream of life happening around you, and it’s very easy to get caught up in that stream and simply kind of keep on moving.
 - My parents made the decision never to focus on my looks, and I had no sense of myself as beautiful.
 - We don’t ruminate during a fight. Maybe in a bath, or driving a car, or as we take a walk. But not right smack in the middle of a dramatic moment.

 - I’ll have my students try to follow their minds during the course of a day, just to see the way their minds work, the way our minds hop from thing to thing to thing. The Internet mirrors that to such a degree you can actually see it. Show me your search history and I’ll show you who you are.
