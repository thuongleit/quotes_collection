 - The secret of endurance is to remember that your pain is temporary but your reward will be eternal.
 - People may refuse our love or reject our message, but they are defenseless against our prayers.
 - If God was small enough for you to completely understand him, he wouldn’t be big enough for you to completely trust him.

 - Worry is focused thinking on something negative. Meditation is doing the same thing only focusing on God’s word instead of your problem.

 - Salvation is not a religion. It’s not rules or regulations or rituals. Salvation is a relationship. That relationship doesn’t begin when you get to Heaven; it begins here on Earth.
 - Love pays attention. Love listens to the fears and the doubts of others and treats them with respect. Love accepts others the way Jesus accepts you.

 - Real life begins by committing yourself completely to Jesus Christ.
 - Real security can only be found in that which can never be taken from you – your relationship with God.

 - Great people are just ordinary people with an extraordinary amount of determination. They simply don’t know how to quit. They just keep on ‘keepin’ on’.
 - Other people are going to find healing in your wounds. Your greatest life messages and your most effective ministry will come out of your deepest hurts.
 - The Bible teaches that we are to love people and use money, but we often get that reversed and you start loving money and using people to get more money. Money is simply a tool to be used for good.

 - If you talked to others the way you talk to yourself, would you have any friends?

 - Being successful and fulfilling your lifes purpose are not at all the same thing; You can reach all your personal goals, become a raving success by the worlds standard and still miss your purpose in this life.
 - Jesus modeled a purpose-driven life, and he taught others how to live it, too. That was the ‘work’ that brought glory to God.

 - A person without conviction is a weak, jellyfish type of individual who mindlessly follows the crowd.
 - There’s a Grand Designer behind everything. Your life is not a result of random chance, fate, or luck. There is a master plan. History is His story. God is pulling the strings.
 - A father, finding time for what is most important is the true marker of a successful person.
 - God is the Father who is full of mercy. God is the Father who is full of comfort. That is the kind of relationship he offers to you.
 - Becoming like Christ is a long, slow process of growth.
 - Your birth was no mistake or mishap, and your life is no fluke of nature. Your parents may not have planned you, but God did. He was not at all surprised by your birth. In fact, he expected it.
 - At the end of your life on earth you will be evaluated and rewarded according to how well you handled what God entrusted to you.

 - To begin loving people today, we must close the door on the past. And that cannot happen without forgiveness! Forgive those who have hurt you – for your sake, not because they deserve it.
 - Every small group has at least one ‘difficult’ person in it. If you don’t immediately recognize who that person is – it’s probably you!
 - We must learn to share the gospel in ways that show it is both GOOD and NEWS. The gospel is about what God has done for us and what we can become in Christ.

 - I believe that you measure the health or strength of a church by its sending capacity rather than its seating capacity.
 - Longing for the ideal while criticizing the real is evidence of immaturity. On the other hand, settling for the real without striving for the ideal is complacency. Maturity is living with the tension.
 - God is much more concerned about your character than your career, because you will take your character into eternity, but not your career.

 - Gods plan isn’t a map for your life that you see all at once, but a scroll unrolled a little at a time.

 - To accomplish anything you must first have a mission, a goal, a hope, a vision.
 - The easiest way to discover the purpose of an invention is to ask the creator of it. The same is true for discovering your life’s purpose: Ask God.
 - The first purpose of your life is to be loved by God! Yes, it is important to serve him, obey, and trust him, but your first purpose is to love him.
