 - It’s not very fun to do spectroscopy.
 - Spectroscopy can probably answer the question, ‘Is there anybody out there?’ Are we alone?
 - When discs form around stars, there is interaction of angular momentum between disc, planets and parent star, and this interaction affects the rotation of the parent star, and that will affect the lithium abundance.
 - Connection between life and radioactive nuclei is straightforward. No life without tectonic activity, without volcanic activity. And we know very well that geothermal energy is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.
 - If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star, strange chemical elements, it can be a signal from a civilization which is there.
 - The one way to discover about aliens is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.
 - Let me mention that not all sun-like stars host planets – perhaps about 30% of them are planet-builders. It’s not so easy to form a planet!
 - There are many unidentified bands in the spectra of stars. Wide bands are produced by some complex molecules in the interstellar space.
