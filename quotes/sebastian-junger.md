 - Of the primary emotions, fear is the one that bears most directly on survival. Children show fear. Adults try not to, maybe because it’s shameful, or, in some circumstances, dangerous. The fear response is automatic, though, and your body runs through its reflexes whether you want it to or not.

 - At 19, your brain hasn’t finished wiring itself. So the first time you have a good friend die, most people don’t go through that at 19. Soldiers do. They’re facing life in this accelerated, compressed form, and a lot of times, they’re not ready for it.
