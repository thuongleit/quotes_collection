 - We are all full of discourses that we only half understand and half mean.
 - The fear that all this will end. The fear that it wonâ€™t.
 - The ghosts swarm. They speak as one person. Each has left something undone.

 - But here I hold your dream in my poem.
 - We sleep together in the dark but confuse light with love.
 - I know you by your willingness.
 - Thus drivers inching southward will see the phalanx of birds heading west as one spontaneous gesture.
 - Carried by light, images remain while sensation is so evanescent as to be always beyond belief.
