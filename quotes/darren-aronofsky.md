 - Classical scores go up and down; they’re kind of hysterical in a way. And movie scores are much more – they just drive and move forward, and they build and can’t go up and down at that same speed. It’s a big job to turn that into something that pushes the movie along.
 - I’m Godless. I’ve had to make my God, and my God is narrative filmmaking.
