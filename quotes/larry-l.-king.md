 - Write. Rewrite. When not writing or rewriting, read. I know of no shortcuts.
 - Good writers are in the business of leaving signposts saying, Tour my world, see and feel it through my eyes; I am your guide.
 - Texas is my mindâ€™s country, that place I most want to understand and record and preserve. Four generations of my people sleep in its soil; I have children there, and a grandson; the dead past and the living future tie me to it.
