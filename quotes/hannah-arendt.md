 - One must think with the body and the soul or not think at all.

 - The greatest enemy of authority, therefore, is contempt, and the surest way to undermine it is laughter.
 - For excellence, the presence of others is always required.
 - Political questions are far too serious to be left to the politicians.
 - Violence can always destroy power; out of the barrel of a gun grows the most effective command, resulting in the most instant and perfect obedience. What never can grow out of it is power.
 - Generally speaking, violence always arises out of impotence. It is the hope of those who have no power...
 - Violence is an expression of impotence.

 - The emotions I feel are no more meant to be shown in their unadulterated state than the inner organs by which we live.

 - If men were ever to lose the appetite for meaning we call thinking, they would lose the capacity for asking all the unanswerable questions upon which every civilization is founded.
 - If we don’t know our own history, we are deemed to live it.
 - Conscience is the anticipation of the fellow who awaits you if and when you come home.
 - Promises are the uniquely human way of ordering the future.
 - When evil is allowed to compete with good, evil has an emotional populist appeal that wins out unless good men and women stand as a vanguard against abuse.
 - The point, as Marx saw it, is that dreams never come true.
 - Fear is an emotion indispensable for survival.
 - The human condition is such that pain and effort are not just symptoms which can be removed without changing life itself; they are the modes in which life itself, together with the necessity to which it is bound, makes itself felt. For mortals, the easy life of the gods would be a lifeless life.
 - Action, as distinguished from fabrication, is never possible in isolation; to be isolated is to be deprived of the capacity to act.
 - The most radical revolutionary will become a conservative the day after the revolution.
 - Since one cannot educate adults, the word “education” has an evil sound in politics; there is a pretense of education, when the real purpose is coercion without the use of force.
 - Only the hypocrite is really rotten to the core.
 - It is in the nature of a group and its power to turn against independence, the property of individual strength.
 - The practice of violence, like all action, changes the world, but the most probable change is a more violent world.
 - Courage is indispensible because in politics not life but the world is at stake.
 - The need of reason is not inspired by the quest for truth but by the quest for meaning. And truth and meaning are not the same. The basic fallacy, taking precedence over all specific metaphysical fallacies, is to interpret meaning on the model of truth.

 - Thinking does not lead to truth; truth is the beginning of thought.
 - The good things in history are usually of very short duration, but afterward have a decisive influence on what happens over long periods of time.

 - Under conditions of tyranny it is far easier to act than to think.
 - The chief qualification of a mass leader has become unending infallibility; he can never admit an error.
 - Nihilism is but the other side of conventionalism; its creed consists of negations of the current so-called positive values, to which it remains bound.
 - It is quite gratifying to feel guilty if you haven’t done anything wrong: how noble! Whereas it is rather hard and certainly depressing to admit guilt and to repent.
 - Man’s chief moral deficiency appears to be not his indiscretions but his reticence.
 - Totalitarianism is never content to rule by external means, namely, through the state and a machinery of violence; thanks to its peculiar ideology and the role assigned to it in this apparatus of coercion, totalitarianism has discovered a means of dominating and terrorizing human beings from within.
 - Ideological thinking becomes emancipated from the reality that we perceive with our five senses, and insists on a ‘truer’ reality concealed behind all perceptible things, dominating them from this place of concealment and requiring a sixth sense that enables us to become aware of it.
 - Manipulations of opinion, insofar as they are inspired by well-defined interests, have limited goals; their effect, however, if they happen to touch upon an issue of authentic concern, is no longer subject to their control and may easily produce consequences they never foresaw or intended.

 - Scientific and philosophic truth have parted company.

 - The cultural treasures of the past, believed to be dead, are being made to speak, in the course of which it turns out that they propose things altogether different than what had been thought.
 - Action painting has to do with self-creation or self-definition or self-transcendence; but this dissociates it from self-expression, which assumes the acceptance of the ego as it is, with its wound and its magic.
 - Of all human activities, only labor, and neither action nor work, is unending, progressing automatically in accordance with life itself and outside the range of willful decisions or humanly meaningful purposes.
 - The way God has been thought of for thousands of years is no longer convincing; if anything is dead, it can only be the traditional thought of God.

 - The possible redemption from the predicament of irreversibility – of being unable to undo what one has done – is the faculty of forgiving.
 - There always comes a point beyond which lying becomes counterproductive. This point is reached when the audience to which the lies are addressed is forced to disregard altogether the distinguishing line between truth and falsehood in order to be able to survive.
 - Truthfulness has never been counted among the political virtues, and lies have always been regarded as justifiable tools in political dealings.
 - The totalitarian attempt at global conquest and total domination has been the destructive way out of all impasses. Its victory may coincide with the destruction of humanity; wherever it has ruled, it has begun to destroy the essence of man.
 - A life spent entirely in public, in the presence of others, becomes, as we would say, shallow. While it retains its visibility, it loses its quality of rising into sight from some darker ground which must remain hidden if it is not to lose its depth in a very real, non-subjective sense.
 - Under conditions of terror, most people will comply but some people will not.

 - The new always happens against the overwhelming odds of statistical laws and their probability, which for all practical, everyday purposes amounts to certainty; the new therefore always appears in the guise of a miracle.
 - Even though we have lost yardsticks by which to measure, and rules under which to subsume the particular, a being whose essence is a beginning may have enough of origin within himself to understand without preconceived categories and to judge without the set of customary rules which is morality.
 - No punishment has ever possessed enough power of deterrence to prevent the commission of crimes. On the contrary, whatever the punishment, once a specific crime has appeared for the first time, its reappearance is more likely than its initial emergence could ever have been.

 - Death not merely ends life, it also bestows upon it a silent completeness, snatched from the hazardous flux to which all things human are subject.
 - You think that you can judge what’s good or evil from whether you enjoy doing it or not. You think that evil is what always appears in the form of a temptation, while good is what you never spontaneously want to do. I think this is all total rubbish, if you don’t mind my saying so.
 - Ideas, as distinguished from events, are never unprecedented.
 - There are many great authors of the past who have survived centuries of oblivion and neglect, but it is still an open question whether they will be able to survive an entertaining version of what they have to say.
 - It is in the very nature of things human that every act that has once made its appearance and has been recorded in the history of mankind stays with mankind as a potentiality long after its actuality has become a thing of the past.
