 - He who is silent and bows his head dies every time he does so. He who speaks aloud and walks with his head held high dies only once.
 - He who doesn’t fear death dies only once.
 - If you are scared you die every day. If you are not scared, you die only once.
 - The important thing is not establishing if you are afraid or not but it’s to be able to live with your own fear without being influenced by it. Otherwise it’s not courage anymore, but recklessness.
 - One usually dies because one is alone, or because one has got into something over one’s head. One often dies because one does not have the right alliances, because one is not given support. In Sicily the Mafia kills the servants of the State that the State has not been able to protect.
