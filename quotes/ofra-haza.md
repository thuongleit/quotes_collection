 - Sometimes, if things are not going so well, I don’t cry. I say maybe it’s meant to be.
 - My childhood was filled with music and singing and a passion for traditional Yemenite songs, picked up from my mother.
 - I don’t know what I would have done without believing in God. His support gives me power and energy to continue to be optimistic, to smile, not to be depressed. Sometimes, if things are not going so well, I don’t cry. I say maybe it’s meant to be.
