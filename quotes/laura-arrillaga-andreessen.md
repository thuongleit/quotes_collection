 - Nonprofits are the intermediaries between generosity and social change.
 - Giving is an expression of gratitude for our blessings.
 - Giving is a universal opportunity. Regardless of your age, profession, religion, income bracket, and background, you have the capacity to create change.
 - The word ‘philanthropy’ brings up an image of somebody who’s had an illustrious career, has retired and is giving to highly established institutions that may or may not have ivy growing up their walls. I personally have felt the need to give philanthropy a reboot.
 - Being innovative in your philantropy allows you to stride forward in your giving journey; you can marry your mind and heart to turn charity into lasting impact; and you can become more ambitious in your giving.
 - Philanthropy is often seen as society’s risk capital. That means the onus is on philanthropists, nonprofit leaders and social entrepreneurs to innovate. But philanthropic innovation is not just about creating something new. It also means applying new thinking to old problems, processes and systems.
 - When I look at founders and CEOs like Mark Zuckerberg at Facebook and Brian Chesky at Airbnb and Sebastian Thrun at Udacity, these are companies that are creating extraordinary social good and extraordinary economic and educational empowerment, all within with context of a for-profit model.
 - Shouldn’t you put the same amount of effort into your giving as you might for your for-profit investments? After all, philanthropy is an investment, and one in which lives – not profits – are at stake.
 - The fact that 35 percent of all American giving went to religious organizations in 2010 reflects how closely bound many of us are with our place of worship.
 - Too often we’re happy to receive thanks from the nonprofits we fund, accepting gratitude instead of feedback or performance measurements.
 - We’re seeing that business models and philanthropic models are not mutually exclusive.
 - Actively deciding to give to causes that move you deeply is far more fulfilling than the momentary gratification derived from signing a check and mailing it to a nonprofit about which you know little more than what’s on the brochure they sent you.
 - You can express your generosity in ways that are virtually limitless. This was what I wanted to convey in ‘Giving 2.0’ – that whether you have $10 or $10 million to give, if you identify the right opportunities and make the most of your resources, your impact can be tremendous.
