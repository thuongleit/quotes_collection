 - I am determined to defend my rights and maintain my freedom or sell my life in the attempt.
 - Permit me then to recommend from the sincerity of my heart, ready at all times to bleed in my countryâ€™s cause, a Declaration of Independence, and call upon the world and the Great God who governs it to witness the necessity, propriety and rectitude thereof.
 - America must raise an empire of permanent duration, supported upon the grand pillars of Truth, Freedom, and Religion, encouraged by the smiles of Justice and defended by her own patriotic sons.
