 - We don’t “have” a great day, we “make it” a great day!
 - You are either green and growing, or ripe and rotting.
 - The more honor and self-respect among players, the greater the team.
 - Be a tough-minded optimist.
 - Make the big time where you are!
 - The big time is not a place; it’s the state of your heart. It’s not something you get; it’s something you become.
