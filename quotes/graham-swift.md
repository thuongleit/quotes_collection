 - Literature is the voice of the human heart.
 - How quick and rushing life can sometimes seem, when at the same time it’s so slow and sweet and everlasting.

 - I do my thinking while I walk. It just loosens up the mind in the way that you don’t get when you are sitting at a desk.
 - What we wish upon the future is very often the image of some lost, imagined past.
 - There has always been, for me, this other world, this second world to fall back on – a more reliable world in so far as it does not hide that its premise is illusion.

 - That’s the way it is: life inculdes a lot of empty space. We are one-tenth living tissue, nine-tenths water; life is one-tenth Here and Now, nine-tenths a history lesson. For most of the time the Here and Now is neither now nor here.
 - Today’s news, which may be yesterday’s anyway, will be eclipsed tomorrow.
 - All nature’s creatures join to express nature’s purpose. Somewhere in their mounting and mating, rutting and butting is the very secret of nature itself.
 - When anything goes digital, let alone something as immaterial as a book, there is a tendency to see it as just in the air to be taken, and to lose the sense that somebody once made it.
 - London is like no other city I know in its ability to become beautiful. You can suddenly turn a corner and there are odd moments – of light, of weather.

 - If people read ‘Tomorrow’ and feel that it is offering them some view of my own household, they would be very, very wrong.
 - I think the purveyors of e-books are only too happy for this atmosphere of ‘everything belongs to everybody’ to increase because it means they don’t have to think so much about the original maker of the thing, or they can get away with paying them less.
