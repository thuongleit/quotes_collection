 - Prototype, then polish. Get it working before you optimize it.

 - When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible – and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
 - If Unix could present the same face, the same capabilities, on machines of many different types, it could serve as a common software environment for all of them.
 - Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
 - Complexity control is the central problem of writing software in the real world.

 - That stupid people are more violent is a fact independent of skin color.
 - The only way to write complex software that won’t fall on its face is to hold its global complexity down – to build it out of simple pieces connected by well-defined interfaces, so that most problems are local and you can have some hope of fixing or optimizing a part without breaking the whole.
 - Linux evolved in a completely different way. From nearly the beginning, it was rather casually hacked on by huge numbers of volunteers coordinating only through the Internet.
