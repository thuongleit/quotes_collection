 - Sometimes the hardest people to love are the ones who need it the most.
 - I don’t know how you say good-bye to whom and what you love. I don’t know a painless way to do it, don’t know the words to capture a heart so full and a longing so intense.
 - That’s what innocence is, you know. A blissful oblivion of what’s coming, of what you’ll lose and what you’ll gain, and what kind of person you’ll grow up to be.
 - Ignorance of the outcome doesn’t exempt you from the consequences.
