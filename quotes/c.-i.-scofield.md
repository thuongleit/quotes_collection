 - The promise to the Church is a promise of persecution, if faithful in this world, but a promise of a great inheritance and reward hereafter.
 - The Word of truth teaches in the clearest and most positive terms that all of the dead will be raised. No doctrine of the faith rests upon a more literal and emphatic body of Scripture authority than this, nor is any more vital to Christianity.
 - In contrast with the law, which imposed giving as a divine requirement, Christian giving is voluntary, and a test of sincerity and love.
