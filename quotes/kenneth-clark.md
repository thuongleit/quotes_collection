 - Children who are treated as if they are uneducable almost invariably become uneducable.
 - I believe that in spite of the recent triumphs of science, men haven’t changed much in the last two thousand years; and in consequence we must still try to learn from history. History is ourselves.
 - No nude, however abstract, should fail to arouse in the spectator some vestige of erotic feeling, even if it be only the faintest shadow – and if it does not do so it is bad art and false morals.
 - It is often said that Leonardo drew so well because he knew about things; it is truer to say that he knew about things because he drew so well.
 - The nude does not simply represent the body, but relates it, by analogy, to all structures that have become part of our imaginative experience.
 - Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of Western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process.

 - All color is no color.
 - Lives devoted to Beauty seldom end well.
 - We can hardly imagine a state of mind in which all material objects were regarded as symbols of spirtual truths or episodes in sacred history. Yet, unless we make this effort of imagination, Medieval art is largely incomprehensible.

 - To hurry through the rise and fall of a fine, full sentence is like defying the role of time in human life.
 - People sometimes tell me that they prefer barbarism to civilisation. I doubt if they have given it a long enough trial. Like the people of Alexandria, they are bored by civilisation; but all the evidence suggests that the boredom of barbarism is infinitely greater.

 - A racist system inevitably destroys and damages human beings; it brutalizes and dehumanizes them, blacks and whites alike.
 - Changes in the structure of society are not brought about solely by massive engines of doctrine. The first flash of insight which persuades human beings to change their basic assumptions is usually contained in a few phrases.
 - We are part of a great whole. All living things are our brothers and sisters.
 - You have no idea what portrait painters suffer from the vanity of their sitters.
 - Few people can look at a painting longer than it takes to peel an orange and eat it.
 - Racial prejudices are indication of a disturbed and potentially unstable society.
 - The Cathedrals were built to the glory of God; New York was built to the glory of Mammon.
 - The dark ghettos are social, political, educational and-above all-economic colonies. Their inhabitants are subject peoples, victims of the greed, cruelty, insensitivity, guilt, and fear of their masters.
 - Evidently one cannot look for long at the Last Supper without ceasing to study it as a composition, and beginning to speak of it as a drama. It is the most literary of all great pictures, one of the few of which the effect may largely be conveyed – can even be enhanced – by description.
 - Pride, like humility, is destroyed by one’s insistence that he possesses it.
 - Energy is eternal delight; and from the earliest times human beings have tried to imprison it in some durable hieroglyphic. It is perhaps the first of all the subjects of art.

 - A lot of people you think you know you don’t know until you find out you don’t know then it may be too late to know.
 - It would be unfair to say that I prefer the back of a book to its contents, but it is true that the sight of a lot of books gives me the hope that I may some day read them, which sometimes develops into the belief that I have read them.

 - Ingres was one of those artists to whom the outline was something sacred and magical, and the reason is that it was the means of reconciling the major conflict in his art, the conflict between abstraction and sensibility.
 - Over and above the political, economic, sociological, and international implications of racial prejudices, their major significance is that they place unnecessary burdens upon human beings.
 - The various parts of the body cannot be perceived as simple units and have no clear relationship to one another. In almost every detail the body is not the shape that art has led us to believe it should be.
 - Those who wish, in the interest of morality, to reduce Leonardo, that inexhaustible source of creative power, to a neutral or sexless agency, have a strange idea of doing service to his reputation.
 - The great artist takes what he needs.
 - Just as a classical dancer repeats the same movements again and again, in order to achieve a greater perfection of line and balance, so Degas repeats the same motifs – it was one of the things that gave him so much sympathy with dancers.
