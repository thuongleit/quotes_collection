 - Everyone has a story.
 - I didn’t choose BYU, I like to think it chose me.
 - Without In The Company of Men, I could still be teaching, so who knows if this would’ve existed.
 - My best male friend is my best friend until he crosses me. We’re all protective of the self.
 - Everybody has the ability to be manipulative, to be hateful and deceitful.
 - Unrequited love is always a great thing.
 - I will say that the idea of a woman being deceptive came from that original discussion with critics and reporters about if woman could do that kind of thing. Evelyn, herself, grew out of the discussions about how capable women are of deceit and lying and manipulation.
 - I’m more than open to hope, but I think men and women have a difficult time dealing with each other and often take the low road.
 - It’s funny how that comes up, because sometimes I’ll write something and I’ll think, I don’t know if that’s a film or a play, and then other things I feel very strongly about them just being plays – they feel very theatrical to me.
 - In a relationship you have to open yourself up.
 - I felt, if I’m going to take on some of the most overdone material, which is men and women and affairs and betrayal of friends, I had better have a new take on it. I think my films come from a desperation not to be boring.
 - With In the Company of Men, the misogynist label stuck early and firmly. In the end, it probably did hurt the film a bit, because getting women into the theaters was difficult.
 - People have perhaps gotten to the point where for the most part movies are a just bit of escape.

 - I see bits and pieces of me in all the characters in my films.
 - Just in the past few years – since I’ve been making movies, which isn’t a very long time – you now have a culture that is fascinated and informed about the box office in a way that sometimes filmmakers weren’t even.
 - There is a lot of absurdity sometimes, not just in Mormonism but often in other religions that want to pretend that no bad happens in their church, rather than taking care of what bad does happen.
 - But for me, it feels like a natural extension of what I’ve been doing: exploring relationships. Here you have two relationships and we can explore how difficult it is for people to be together.

 - I think Christine and Chad are on the opposite extremes of the spectrum. Christine is a model victim, and Chad is a model perpetrator, and Howard is closer to the middle.

 - I would be more frightened as a writer if people thought my movies were like science fiction.
 - Movies are – all I’ve found is that they’re just tougher and tougher to make.
