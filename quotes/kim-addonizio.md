 - I only want to walk a little longer in the cold blessing of the rain, and lift my face to it.
 - Love me like a wrong turn on a bad road late at night.
 - Maybe you’re one of those people who writes poems, but rarely reads them. Let me put this as delicately as I can: If you don’t read, your writing is going to suck.
 - Love’s merciless, the way it travels in and keeps emitting light.
 - I want to walk like I’m the only woman on earth and I can have my pick.
 - I’m so in love with you I can’t stand up.
