 - Startups Are Hard. So Work More, Cry Less, And Quit All The Whining.
 - Best startups generally come from somebody needing to scratch an itch.
 - I believe the term “blog” means more than an online journal. I believe a blog is a conversation. People go to blogs to read AND write, not just consume.
 - Most people have an aversion to risk, my college economics professor told me. Which means they have to be rewarded to take on that risk. The higher the risk, the higher the possible payout has to be for people to jump.
 - I always try to find the truth in a situation. That unvarnished, pure nugget of truth at the core of every issue that I write about.
 - Everyone wants the rich to pay more in taxes.
 - Customer research produces bland products. We’re producing a piece of art.
