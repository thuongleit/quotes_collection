 - What you know is just a point of departure. So let’s move!
 - When the clouds clear we shall know the colour of the sky.
 - Those things in life that matter will give you pain as you learn to understand life.
 - But any Time is with us. And if we take control to shape our attitude and reshape our memories, that time is always now, – our time for the best possible uses of our lives.
 - What you already know is merely a good departure point.
