 - Retain a calm heart, sit like a turtle, walk swiftly like a pigeon, and sleep like a dog.
 - Every day, mindful practice. When the mind is disciplined then the Way can work for us. Otherwise, all we do is talk of Tao; everything is just words; and the world will know us as its one great fool.
 - We can hold back neither the coming of the flowers nor the downward rush of the stream; sooner or later, everything comes to its fruition.
