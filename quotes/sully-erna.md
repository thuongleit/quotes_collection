 - I’m not the one who’s so far away When I feel the snake bite enter my veins. Never did I wanna be here again, And I don’t remember why I came.
 - Searching for nothing Wondering if I’ll change I’m trying everything But everything still stays the same I thought if I showed you I could fly Wouldn’t need anyone by my side I’m running backwards With broken wings I know I’ll die.
