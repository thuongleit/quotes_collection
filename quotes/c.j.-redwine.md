 - No matter what has happened. No matter what you’ve done. No matter what you will do. I will always love you. I swear it.
 - Silent acquiescence in the face of tyranny is no better than outright agreement.
 - It’s probably my job to tell you life isn’t fair, but I figure you already know that. So instead, I’ll tell you that hope is precious, and you’re right not to give up.
 - I love how you still think if you tell me to do something, I’ll just check my brain at the door and do it.
