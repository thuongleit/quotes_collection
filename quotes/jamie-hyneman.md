 - Duct tape is not a perfect solution to anything. But with a little creativity, in a pinch, it’s an adequate solution to just about everything.
 - Sometimes the best people to be around are not exactly like you – because if they were, what is the point? If they contribute something different than you can, that is when they are valuable.
 - I always telling people to “not try this at home,” because most of what we do on MythBusters is really dangerous. Consequently, we can’t encourage people to try that stuff.
 - We have relatively little time and a whole lot of curiosity, so the most efficient way to get there is what we do, and that often happens to be some form of science.
 - From our point of view, we’re just curious, we’re poking around and having fun. If it’s science, if it’s accurate, if it’s not accurate, we did the best we can to keep things clean and understandable, but we’re just having fun, so sue us if we got something wrong.
 - I think “MythBusters” is a step up from special effects because we not only have to make things look like they work, they actually do have to work. It’s more challenging and even transcendental.
 - Any day we create that much shrapnel is a good day.
 - Fun for us just happens to be screwing around with anything that gets our attention and is thought-provoking.

 - I’ve learned that I can pretty much do anything I’ve wanted to as long as I was methodical and diligent about it. It may not sound very exciting really, but it works.
 - Science isn’t just for scientists and guys in lab coats. It’s something that everybody can do.

 - There are a lot of times when we can just time something and say “busted” or “confirmed” or whatever, instead of building a robot or some gadget to make it happen more elaborately. In those cases, we’re simply enjoying ourselves.
 - There’s no director who wants to portray cheese puffs with a certain color that’s going to make or break the commercial, in his opinion. We don’t have to do that, so I don’t miss it at all, really.
 - The idea that you can contribute is really important, especially for a kid.
