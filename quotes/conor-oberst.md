 - My favorite rhymes are sort of half-rhymes where you might just get the vowel sound the same, but it’s not really a true rhyme. That gives you far more flexibility to capture the feeling you’re trying to express. But sometimes it’s best not to have any rhyme.
 - Cause a costume can be comfortable It can make you feel more beautiful It can even make you look like someone else But it’s still you, so there’s nothing you can do Like a bad habit, the one you couldn’t kick, there it always is And it’s nothing that no doctor’s gonna fix.
 - The world’s become a little too mean.
 - I think there’s so much about Rasta culture that’s interesting. Just the idea of preaching one-ness, that we’re all in this together.
 - I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health. I said, ‘There’s nothing that I can do for you that you can’t do for yourself.’ He said, ‘Oh yes you can. Just hold my hand. I think that that would help.’ So I sat with him a while then I asked him how he felt. He said, ‘I think I’m cured.’
 - Because the truth is that gossip is as good as gospel in this town. You can save face but you won’t ever save your soul. And that’s a fact.
 - Love’s an excuse to get hurt.
 - I think it is more like a ghost that has been following us both. Something vague that we’re not seeing, something more like a feeling.

 - My head’s a carousel of pictures and The spinning never stops.
 - I think in a lot of ways unconditional love is a myth. My mom’s the only reason I know it’s a real thing.
 - Cause I swear that I’m dying, slowly but its happening.
 - I’ve cried, and you’d think I’d be better for it, but the sadness just sleeps, and it stays in my spine the rest of my life.
 - We’re going to sing about things that matter to us. The balancing act is to present these ideas but also make the music exciting and sort of fun enough that even if you’re not paying attention to the lyrics, you might still like the songs anyway. That’s the idea.
 - If I loved you, well that’s my fault.
 - I need some meaning I can memorize. The kind I have always seems to slip my mind.
 - You mean nothing to no one but that’s nobody’s fault.
 - When everything is lonely I can be my best friend.
 - I don’t feel real confident expressing myself except when I’m writing. I feel kind of scatterbrained. I can see everything from both sides and that makes it hard to reach conclusions. Writing enables me to clarify things.
 - There’s a lot of optimism in changing scenery, in seeing what’s down the road.
 - I know a girl who cries when she practices violin because each note sounds so pure it just cuts into her, and then the melody comes pouring out her eyes. Now, to me, everything else just sounds like a lie.

 - And I sing and sing of awful things The pleasure that my sadness brings.
 - It’s exploding bags, aerosol cans Southbound buses, Peter Pan They left it up to us again I thought you knew the drill It’s kill or be killed.
 - Little soldier, little insect You know war it has no heart It will kill you in the sunshine Or happily in the the dark Where kindness is a card game Or a bent up cigarette In the trenches, in the hard rain With a bullet and a bet.
 - To outsiders it probably seems like splitting hairs, but to me, Bright Eyes is a simply the collaboration between myself and Mike Mogis and Nate Walcott. What you hear is definitely the sum of all our ideas and represents all three of us. But I still write the songs myself.
 - Rastafarianism and reggae music have always kind of resonated with me. Those ideas of redemption, liberation and overcoming oppression through music, weed and community. Fighting evil through love and music, I think it’s just a really powerful idea.
 - I started to sink like the moon tends to do if you stare at it too long Then you blink and it’s gone.
 - On every Bright Eyes record, there’s some kind of sound collage that begins it. Some of them have dialogue, some don’t. I like it because it can kind of slow down the attention span a bit. It’s a way to draw you in to the rest of the record.
 - I’ve given up trying to understand what people think about me.
 - Everything must belong somewhere. I know that now, that’s why I’m staying here.
 - I find that moving keeps me optimistic, the idea of what’s going to be down the road a bit or around the next bend.
 - A boycott is, inherently, a blunt instrument. It is an imperfect weapon, a carpet bomb, when all involved would prefer a surgical strike.

 - And in the morning when the sun rise. Look in the water, see the blue sky. As if heaven has been laid there at our feet.
 - It’s always the negative things that seep through into your consciousness. Most of the positive things just roll off real fast. I just try not to pay attention to it, because I’ve never read anything about my band that’s accurate.
 - Considering our history, I can think of nothing more American than an immigrant.
 - And me I’m in the bathroom crying out my eyelids because it’s hard to be a man when you’re scared, just like a little kid.
 - It’s dangerous to buy into praise and criticism for what you do when you’re trying to present your music to people. I don’t ignore it completely, but I don’t dwell on it too much.
 - There is no Hell when you die so don’t look so worried.
 - I find that life is easier when it is just a blur With no details to confuse who or what or where I was So when the ending comes the full regret will be obscure.
 - So when your new eyes meet mine they won’t see no lies, just love...
 - The Bible’s blind, the Torah’s deaf, the Qur’an is mute; if you burned them all together you’d get close to the truth.
 - On good days, I can see the inherent goodness in people, and that human beings have a high capacity to learn and adapt. But things like the environment, nuclear weapons and ideas like peak oil – if you think about them too much, they can really freak you out.

 - Screaming is bad for the voice, but it’s good for the heart.
 - We’re all too busy working, entertaining ourselves With forty hours, television and prescription pills Well, I take two a day to help my brain behave It never does, but who’s to say? At least my doctor gets paid.
 - Much of appreciating art or music is really the interpretation of the listener. To a certain extent it’s projection – it’s what people need or lack in themselves that they then put upon these people that they admire.
 - You can only really understand good if you have bad, so the idea of heaven or anything that happens for eternity, even if it’s nice, I can’t imagine it being nice forever. Even the idea of forever is kind of ridiculous, which is unfortunate because it’s kind of a nice thing to say, you know.
 - I think our music is more about seeing ourselves in each other and trying to find a more humanistic viewpoint for the world.
 - Art is essentially communication. It doesn’t exist in a vacuum. That’s why people make art, so other people can relate to it.

 - A kid that picks up a record, he doesn’t need to know anything other than the music and have it in his or her headphones. They’re getting ideas directly, it’s like someone whispering in their ear. That’s such a personal way to receive information.
 - The one recurring theme in my writing, and in my life in general, is confusion. The fact that anytime you think you really know something, you’re going to find out you’re wrong – that is the rule. The moments where you think you have something figured out, those are the exceptions.
