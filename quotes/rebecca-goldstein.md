 - So dogma, doctrine, unexamined assumptions, that’s what it is to be sharing that, the hippies shadow, no way of grounding it to reality. It’s where we’re just cut off from reality unless we can argue, we can substantiate, we can justify, we can convince each other.
 - I’m a Spinozist. I believe in reason. I think all the progress that we’ve made making this a better world have been because of reason and not religion. I think religion has been pulled along by reason and that’s why we read The Bible now so differently, even believers.
