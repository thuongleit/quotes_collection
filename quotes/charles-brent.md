 - Pray hardest when it is hardest to pray.
 - A man must not stop listening any more than praying when he rises from his knees. No one questions the need of times of formal address to God, but few admit in any practical way the need of quiet waiting upon God, gazing into His face, feeling for His hand, listening for His voice.
 - Peace comes when there is no cloud between us and God. Peace is the consequence of forgiveness, God’s removal of that which obscures His face and so breaks union with Him.
 - The World will go limping until Christ’s prayer that all may be one is answered.
 - It seems to me, as time goes on, that the only thing that is worth seeking for is to know and to be known by Christ – a privilege open alone to the childlike, who, with receptivity, guilelessness, and humility, move Godward.
 - The happy sequence culminating in fellowship with God is penitence, pardon, and peace – the first we offer, the second we accept, and the third we inherit.
 - There is no chasm in society that cannot be firmly and permanently bridged by intercession; there is no feud or dislike that cannot be healed by the same exercise of love.
 - Repeatedly place your pet opinions and prejudices before God. He will surprise you by showing you that the best of them need refining and some the purification of destruction.
 - A low standard of prayer means a low standard of character and a low standard of service. Those alone labor effectively among men who impetuously fling themselves upward towards God.
 - Pray with your intelligence. Bring things to God that you have thought out and think them out again with Him. That is the secret of good judgment.
 - God has special confidences for each soul. Indeed, it would seem as though the deepest truths came only in moments of profound devotional silence and contemplation.
 - It makes a great difference in our feeling towards others if their needs and their joys are on our lips in prayer; as also it makes a vast difference in their feelings towards us if they know that we are in the habit of praying for them.
