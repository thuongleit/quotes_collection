 - I didn’t want to be like a punch-drunk fighter, going around and reliving the big moment...
 - We grew up quickly, surrounded by guys eighteen and older, in their prime. They lived to surf, drink, raise hell and score heavily with women. I saw these guys going up and down the coast on surf trips, drinking and bagging girls, and all I could think of was ‘What a neat life!’
 - I’d love to say something heroic. I’d love to say we made history. But basically it was a bunch of guys parked around the Bay there, and somebody grabbed a board and went surfing, and it looked so good the rest of us guys said, ‘Hey, we got to get in on this.’
 - It took me longer to get through this site, than to get outside at Waimea.
