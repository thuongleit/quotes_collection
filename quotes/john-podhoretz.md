 - Pop culture is a reflection of social change, not a cause of social change.
 - The most passionately anti-Obama Republican politicians and activists consider themselves the truest and purest of conservatives, and often unleash their scorn and fury on others who also call themselves conservative but differ on strategy and tactics.
 - Christopher Nolan’s astounding third Batman feature, ‘The Dark Knight Rises,’ represents the true maturation of the superhero movie – and provides the key to understanding the bottomless craving moviegoers have for these films, 34 years after the Christopher Reeve Superman gave birth to the genre.
 - The problem is that borrowing money to pay back more borrowed money that will oblige you in the future to borrow even more money doesn’t sound kosher. Because it isn’t.
 - What people adore about superhero movies is the signal quality of the Christopher Nolan films – their complete lack of irony when it comes to the portrayal of heroism and the need for heroes to confront evil.
 - Every great political campaign rewrites the rules; devising a new way to win is what gives campaigns a comparative advantage against their foes.
 - Making recess appointments when the Senate isn’t in recess is neither rational nor moderate. It’s a raw misuse of executive power by a president whose love of government is his most vulnerable spot with the electorate.
 - Conservatives must avoid the siren song of schism, or all is lost.
 - The real story of the Ground Zero mosque is that the project only became feasible because of the appalling and astonishing fecklessness of the officials who were charged with the reconstruction of the site and the neighborhood all the way back in 2001.

 - Back in 1995, Bill Gates himself didn’t understand that the internet was the direction computing was going.
 - Robots have a rich and storied history in movies.
 - It has never made any sense to argue that, unique among the people of the world, Arabs are more concerned on a day-to-day basis about the treatment of people they don’t know than they are about how they’re going to put food on their own tables, or whether their sons will ever find a job.
 - The United States established itself as a trustworthy new nation in its first two decades after the Revolutionary War by paying its debts, even when many in the country believed it had no obligation to do so. Alexander Hamilton, the founder of this newspaper, insisted on it.

 - Your race and gender don’t change, but you can choose to change your political affiliation at will.
 - Over the next decade, cities and states across America will be compelled to tighten their belts as the really big bills – the pension bills they cannot afford – come due. They’ll have to go after existing contracts with current workers.
 - Obama’s coalition would have consigned him to the political margins as little as 12 years ago, but the nation’s demographic changes are moving far more quickly than most Republicans anticipated.
 - I think making a pretense of civility toward Eric Alterman is like making a pretense of civility to a scorpion.
 - Romney is a good, intelligent, extraordinarily generous man who put on a great fight. But he didn’t understand the country or the people he sought to lead, and that is why he lost.

 - The exit polls suggest that after a relatively disappointing first term, Obama managed to reassemble almost all of his 2008 electorate.
 - Many people crave security and stability rather than risk-taking, and that doesn’t make them any less American. They are the workers rather than the job creators, and all societies need both.
 - This has always been the way of presidential politics. The president rises above the fray while his surrogates go on the attack. They throw the spears and fling the mud; he sits upon the throne.
 - America may be in a dour condition, but it is not going to elect a dour president.
 - You’d think experienced political professionals would know better than to place their trust in exit polls, notoriously inaccurate surveys that had John Kerry winning the 2004 election by five points when he actually lost by three.

 - Romney is right that the Obama vision is too centered on government. But his is too centered on the promotion of business and wealth creation at the expense of everything else.
 - Electoral contests have nothing but polls, which is why people have grown so obsessed with them; we’re desperate for an objective rendering of what is happening and what may happen.
 - She needs to seem tough, and whatever Hillary’s weaknesses, tough is a pretty good word to describe her.
 - America is great not because it’s a team. America is great because it is a nation whose founding documents elevated the rights of the individual.
 - Romney has adopted almost every position conservatives want their candidate to espouse: He’s pro-life, he wants to repeal ObamaCare, he wants to cut taxes and cut the federal budget, and he wants an unapologetic foreign policy dedicated to the proposition that this too will be the American century.
 - When Obama was inaugurated, he and his team had an insight – though whether the insight was conscious or not I don’t know. But it was this: The TARP $700 billion price tag was a new kind of model.
 - Here’s a very good rule of thumb in politics: losing begets losing.
 - The great mystery is why robots come off so well in science-fiction films when the human characters are often so astoundingly wooden.
 - Newt Gingrich has a restless and outsized intelligence that is tragically unleavened by any kind of critical sensibility.

 - Comedians and impressionists used to be two different showbiz animals entirely, but now there’s no such thing as a comedian who doesn’t do impressions.
 - As a matter of policy, increasing taxes on the most economically productive group, which already generates 60 percent of the nation’s federal revenues, during a sustained period of economic doldrums is a wretched idea.
 - Obama has seen to the passage of the most radical legislation in recent American history and so-called ‘progressives’ should be thanking him for it – even as many of the rest of us rear in horror from its implications.
 - You want a political culture that works to create conditions under which an economy can thrive? Since signing the Oslo Accords with the Palestinians, Israel has spent two decades working to unshackle its economy from its socialist roots, with remarkable results.
 - For Obama to save himself, he should be thinking about the example of an unlikely Republican predecessor: Richard Nixon.
 - The presidency is not an entry-level electoral job.
 - The classic rule of thumb is that if you are an intellectual ideological magazine, you do better in opposition than you do if your views are reflected by people in power.
 - Obama is talking to voters as though he is their boss, or their principal, or their father. He is not any of those things. He is their employee. And employers don’t like it when their employees yell at them – even if their employees have it right.

 - The thing is, Obama is right that it would be a calamity for the government to default on its debt by not meeting its obligations. Such a thing has never happened and can’t be allowed to happen.
 - Memories of the last nine years have turned Ground Zero from a site of horror, to a reminder of grief, to an occasion for ludicrous artistic posturing – and now to something very close to parody.
 - Why, listening to Obama talk about his economic triumphs over the last three years might make you want to move to the country he was describing. Too bad that country exists primarily in his own head.
 - Unquestionably, American political rhetoric can be repugnant, and the Right can certainly be as guilty as the Left.

 - Nixon in 1968, unlike Obama 2008, was elected as a minority president with only 43 percent of the vote. Yet, in 1972, he won what, in some measures, was the most lopsided election in American history with 61 percent.
