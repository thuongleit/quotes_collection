 - This is the land of dreamings, a land of wide horizons and secret places. The first people, our ancestors, created this country in the culture that binds us to it.
 - Our culture is something that has sustained us for thousands and thousands of years and will continue to do so in generations to come.
 - Our artists have the power to bring our dreams and our nightmares to life so we will never forget.
