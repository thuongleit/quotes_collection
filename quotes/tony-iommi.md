 - It has always been my goal to believe in what I do and love what I do and be true to that.
 - I didn’t follow any rules at all. I made my own.

 - Eddie Van Halen was probably the most influential.
 - I was mostly surprised by the rap artists, actually, that were influenced by Sabbath. That was a surprise. But it’s very nice and I’m very honoured. It’s nice to know after 27 years now that what I said in the first place has stuck, and that was the belief in it.
