 - We must be holy without holiness. We must be whole, complete. That’s being holy. Any other kind of holiness is false, a snare, and a delusion.

 - I want to undress you, vulgarize you a bit.
 - You start with the sublime and end up in an alley jerking away for dear life.
 - The tragedy of it is that nobody sees the look of desperation on my face. Thousands and thousands of us, and we’re passing one another without a look of recognition.

 - It is no accident that propels people like us to Paris.
 - Surrealism is merely the reflection of the death process. It is one of the manifestations of a life becoming extinct, a virus which quickens the inevitable end.

 - The purpose of life is to remember.
 - No matter how vast, how total, the failure of man here on earth, the work of man will be resumed elsewhere. War leaders talk of resuming operations on this front and that, but man’s front embraces the whole universe.
 - The most difficult thing to adjust to, apparently, is peace and contentment.
 - Forget the books you want to write. Think only of the book you are writing.
 - The word which gives the key to the national vice is waste. And people who are wasteful are not wise, neither can they remain young and vigorous. In order to transmute energy to higher and more subtle levels one must first conserve it.

 - The man who looks for security, even in the mind, is like a man who would chop off his limbs in order to have artificial ones which will give him no pain or trouble.

 - The full and joyful acceptance of the worst in oneself may be the only sure way of transforming it.
 - Human beings make a strange fauna and flora. From a distance they appear negligible; close up they are apt to appear ugly and malicious. More than anything they need to be surrounded with sufficient space – space even more than time.

 - The concert is a polite form of self induced torture.

 - Even if it doesn’t work, there is something healthy and invigorating about direct action.
 - It is the American vice, the democratic disease which expresses its tyranny by reducing everything unique to the level of the herd.

 - How different the new order would be if we could consult the veteran instead of the politician.
 - If the poet can no longer speak for society, but only for himself, then we are at the last ditch.
 - Reality is not protected or defended by laws, proclamations, ukases, cannons and armadas. Reality is that which is sprouting all the time out of death and disintegration.

 - And what is the potential man, after all? Is he not the sum of all that is human? Divine, in other words?

 - Music is a beautiful opiate, if you don’t take it too seriously.
 - The vast difference between astrology and other sciences, if I may put it thus, is that astrology deals not with facts but with profundities. The solid ground on which the scientist pretends to rest gives way, in astrology, to imponderables.
 - What is not in the open street is false, derived, that is to say, literature.

 - What does it matter how one comes by the truth so long as one pounces upon it and lives by it?
 - Art is only a means to life, the life more abundant. It merely points the way.
 - The Frenchman is first and foremost a man. He is likeable often just because of his weaknesses, which are always thoroughly human, even if despicable.
