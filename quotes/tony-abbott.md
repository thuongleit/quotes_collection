 - No cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts to pensions.
 - Middle income families with children are Australia’s new poor.
 - I’m not saying that people on welfare don’t contribute in their own way, but as many as possible should be encouraged to be economically active as well as socially and culturally active.

 - If you want to put a price on carbon why not just do it with a simple tax.
