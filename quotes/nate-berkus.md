 - Your home should tell the story of who you are.
 - Your home should tell the story of who you are, and be a collection of what you love brought together under one roof.
 - You will enrich your life immeasurably if you approach it with a sense of wonder and discovery, and always challenge yourself to try new things.
 - It’s important how we feel in our homes, because feeling good makes us more gracious. And that makes it easier to welcome others not only into our homes but into our lives.
 - Layering in different patterns will keep things from appearing too studied.
 - One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned during my time on ‘Oprah’ is that everyone wants to be heard. We all want to have our humanity acknowledged – to have others see us for who we truly are. We all want to know that we are valued, we are heard, we are understood.
 - The truth is that things matter. They have to, they are what we live with and touch each and every day. They represent what we’ve seen, who we’ve loved and where we hope to go next. They remind us of the good times and the rough patches and everything in between that’s made us who we are.
 - Even as a 10-year-old, I remember trying to explain to my mother and stepfather how upset and frustrated a messy room made me. But they just couldn’t grasp it. They wanted me to be playing with baseballs and frogs while I wanted to be scouring garage sales.
 - I believe your home tells a story about who you are and who you aspire to be. We represent ourselves through the things we own. I don’t believe in trends. I believe in collecting things that you connect with. We should surround ourselves with things we care about, that have meaning.
 - Design, to me, is part psychology, part sociology, and part magic. A good decorator should know what’s going on in someone’s marriage and how their kids are doing in school.
 - You don’t have to paint your walls lime green just to try to have your home feel decorated. If you’re a classic dresser or preppy dresser or a modern dresser, you wear a lot of black – whatever it is – your home should reflect that as well.
 - The Things That Matter convincingly lays out Nate Berkus’s philosophy that things do matter. Our homes tell our stories, they reflect the places we’ve been and the people we’ve loved along the way – and there can be no more beautiful design for living than that.
 - Go outside! I mean, even leaves from a park are beautiful in a clear glass vase. I’d rather see that than fake anything any day.
 - Everywhere your eye travels in your home, it should land on something that resonates with you.
 - I’m interested in fashion; I buy fairly good pieces, and I think as I’ve gotten older, I’ve pared down a lot.
 - I see it every day: People trying to create a home that somebody else tells them they should have. I don’t care if it’s a magazine or a bossy friend – when somebody says, ‘This is what’s elegant, this is what’s trendy,’ if it doesn’t represent you, you’re not going to be happy.
 - Color is a very personal thing. You need to make sure to choose a color that makes you happy. But I don’t recommend accent walls – choose a color you can live with on all four walls.
 - People first. Dogs second. Things last.
 - I always had this New York fantasy of living in a glass high-rise.
 - A lot of guys go in immediately for status, as opposed to comfort and allowing their home to tell a story about them.
 - I got my first Charvet knit tie when I was 15. I actually stole it from my father. I love them because you can wear them day to night. They’re French and preppy and have been around since the 1800s.
 - I made my parents crazy. As a kid, I redecorated my bedroom every month. I would literally save my allowance and go buy things.
 - You don’t need to spend a lot of money on stuff when you have amazing architecture.
 - I didn’t necessarily want to be famous growing up, but I knew I would be a good famous person because I’m not offended if somebody comes up to me and knows things about me and wants to engage me in a conversation.
 - I tend not to wear ties very often. I’m usually in old stuff: Hermes or Marc Jacobs boots and jeans and a T-shirt and a leather jacket or a jean jacket.
 - There’s something beautiful and very circular about passing by something that was important to the person you loved, or touching something that once meant something to him – that brings me some peace.
 - Home has always been one of the most important things. If I don’t feel at home in my space, then I feel really unmoored.
 - When you have a bunch of comfortable upholstered pieces, a single bronze or brass chair really turns the energy up.
 - As a kid, I think I rearranged the rooms of almost every house on the block.
 - I can change a light fixture, and I can do certain things. But I’m really bad in terms of construction. I can’t do any of it on my own.
 - In a modern loft, you can’t just fill a space with furniture. Each piece has to be perfect.
 - I’ve always felt that color is intrinsically personal. It evokes a tremendous amount of emotion. If there’s a color you respond to, that’s something you can incorporate into your home. No one can tell you it’s wrong.
 - In a minimal interior, what you don’t do is as important as what you do.
 - I’m not going to say paint is an easy spruce-up. It takes time, it needs touch-ups, and you have to be very methodical. But it is worth it, and it isn’t particularly expensive.
 - Thread count is actually a lie. Just because a thread count is 1,500 on a set of sheets doesn’t mean that they’re well-made sheets. Truly, the quality of the cotton and the quality of the way something is woven is much more important than thread count.
 - About 90 percent of the pieces in my home are vintage, and I’m a ruthless editor. I only live with things that I love. There is not one thing in my home that doesn’t have meaning to me.
 - My favorite thing about decorating is mixing different periods and styles. If you have something that’s old, and you really do want to mix those styles, then you have to add something that’s obviously modern with it. You can’t put a kind of a mediocre thing in the middle.
 - I was barely in grade school when I helped my mother rearrange the living room furniture for the first time.
 - When you buy things that are expensive, like a sofa or something that really feels like an investment, you need to keep it as plain as possible, as simple as possible. Make sure that it’s a clean design that will work with whatever style you want it to.
 - You can’t be around Oprah and not have her influence you, and I don’t mean that because she’s doling out the free advice. I mean it because she is someone that leads with truth and follows her heart. She’s a force.
 - They used to tease me at the ‘Oprah’ show, ‘Are you really going to do another white Shaker kitchen, with white subway tile and stainless steel appliances?’ And my answer is, ‘I can vary it a bit, but I’m never going to err from classic materials.’
 - We’re not handling things anymore before they arrive on our doorstep. I like to feel how thin porcelain can be, run my hand over a textile, see if I want to sit in a chair.
 - You can change the feel of your sofa by adding a thick, cozy throw and playing a couple of classic pillows off a more Moroccan-inspired one.
 - If you actually keep things very organized and clutter-free, you can have more furniture than you think you can in a small space.
 - I can look at a photo and the dimensions of any piece and tell you if it’s going to sit well with the four other pieces in your room.
 - I didn’t grow up thinking I’d be a decorator. Design is my greatest passion, and it naturally just pulled me down the path. Same with TV. Being famous or having a show was never the motivation. I got a call and was swept up by the challenge of that first small space redesign.
 - Before you begin designing or buying anything, you need to get real and ask yourself: What do you really want to use this room for? What do you want to do in this room but can’t now?
 - You can find a lot of reasonable buys at Wal-Mart. But one key to making it on a budget is by donating your time and labor to the project. Do-it-yourself projects will always help you save.
 - I don’t believe in having spaces in the home that don’t get used. We pay so much for square footage that to waste it is criminal.
 - In design-speak, ‘a library’ means a room lined with books, floor-to ceiling, but it all depends on the space you have. You may have a free-standing bookshelf of your favorite books if that’s all you have room for.
 - Mixing in some rusty oranges is a warm way to update your place for fall.
 - I really can’t live without my In-N-Out burgers. Honestly, I can’t. Even when I’m doing the whole no-carb thing occasionally, I make an exception for these. They’re too delicious to count.

 - I live in a beautiful vintage building that was built in the heart of downtown Chicago.
 - Everywhere in my house are these little things that have meanings and make me think of great memories.
 - Books are the heart of any home, and I spend hours going through books for design inspiration.
 - First and foremost, I’m a decorator and product designer. Everything I do, the television shows, the books, that comes from the design work. It’s what I love.
 - In a small space, you want to keep the bedding as simple as possible so it looks clean, calm and collected.
 - When I see a wall that’s hung with different objects, framed or unframed, what I like about it is its fluidity and rule-breaking nature. Just experiment a bit.
 - I always want objects in my home that have a connection to me or something I’ve loved. It’s still stuff, but it’s stuff that has meaning.
 - I am not ever in the business of making anyone feel bad.
 - Buying found objects means repurposing something that was already made years before, sometimes decades before. It strikes a nice balance between the new and used equation we should strive for in our lives.

 - I hate sets. I’ve always hated sets. I think that if you have a dining room set, break it up!
 - I think that a lot of guys reach for electronics first, but the truth is that you can never keep up with electronics. You buy a flat-screen TV, and then six months later, there’s one that has 3D and Blu-ray and all this business, and that is just going to keep continuing.
 - It’s my job to know what’s available from every retailer, catalog, website, antiques mall, and craftsperson. A good designer or decorator has to have an almost encyclopedic knowledge.
