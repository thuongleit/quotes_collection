 - A springlike autumn’s balmy breeze reaches afar. The sun shines on the house of a recluse South of the river; They encourage the December apricots To burst into bloom: A simplehearted person Faces the simplehearted flowers.
 - The secret of the receptive Must be sought in stillness; Within stillness there remains The potential for action.
 - When you’ve cooked the marrow of the sun and moon, The pearl is so bright you don’t worry about poverty.
 - Cut brambles long enough, Sprout after sprout, And the lotus will bloom Of its own accord: Already waiting in the clearing, The single image of light. The day you see this, That day you will become it.
