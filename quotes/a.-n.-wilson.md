 - I don’t write books inadvertently.
 - We, while noting many things amiss about Victorian society, more often sense them judging us.
 - I suppose if I’d got a brilliant first and done research I might still be a don today, but I hope not. People become dons because they are incapable of doing anything else in life.

 - History does not eliminate grievances. It lays them down like landmines.
