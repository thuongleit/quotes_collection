 - I think a lot of making art is listening to yourself.
 - I like that feeling when you’re making art, that you’re taking the energy out of your body and putting it into a physical object. I like things that are labor-intensive : you make a little thing and another little thing and another little thing, and eventually you see a possibility.
 - You can have fantasies about having control over the world, but I know I can barely control my kitchen sink. That is the grace I’m given. Because when one can control things, one is limited to one’s own vision.

 - Prior to my father’s death, I was having a hard time committing to a career as an artist, but that’s not because of who he was – it was because of who I am. It’s true, though, that I felt I shouldn’t compete with him, and that those feelings went away after he died.
 - I think that objects have memories. I’m always thinking that I’ll go to the museum and see something and have a big memory about some other lifetime.
