 - When I was little the sky was closer.
 - I still don’t know what it really means to grow up. However, if I happen to meet you, one day in the future, by then, I want to become someone you can be proud to know.
 - I probably just want to leave a trace of myself behind in this world.
 - It must really be a lonelier journey than anyone could imagine. Cutting through absolute darkness, encountering nothing but the occasional hydrogen atom. Flying blindly into the abyss, believing therein lie the answers to the mysteries of the universe.
 - I see why now Tohno-kun is different from the others. Like the rocket shooting off into space, on the loneliest journey? to the far end of the solar system. Because he’s always looking at something beyond me. He can never see me. I cried myself to sleep, thinking of him.
