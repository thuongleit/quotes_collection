 - If we are not a little bit uncomfortable every day, we’re not growing. All the good stuff is outside our comfort zone.
 - What have you done for YOURSELF this year to create a better life?
 - Part of paying the price is the willingness to do whatever it takes to get the job done. It comes from a declaration that you are going to get it done no matter what it takes, no matter how long it takes, no matter what comes up.

 - The things that bring you the greatest joy are in alignment with your purpose.
 - I’m a big believer in growth. Life is not about achievement, it’s about learning and growth, and developing qualities like compassion, patience, perseverance, love, and joy, and so forth. And so if that is the case, then I think our goals should include something which stretches us.

 - I consider myself to be an inverse paranoid. I always operate as if everything is part of a universal plot to enhance my well-being.
 - True freedom is an inward state of being. Once it is attained, no situation in the world can bind one or limit one’s freedom.
