 - Adventure is just about doing something you’ve never done – doing it with enthusiasm and curiosity: doing something difficult with passion.
 - Life is too brief and too rich to tiptoe through half-heartedly, rather than galloping at it with whooping excitement and ambition.
 - See the opportunities for adventures, not the constraints that get in the way.
 - Sometimes all you need is to climb a simple hill, to spend time staring at an empty horizon, to jump into a cold river or sleep under the stars, or perhaps share a whisky at a small country inn in order to remind yourself what matters most to you in life.
 - You do not need to fly to the other side of the planet to find wilderness and beauty.
