 - Things will get worse before they get better.
 - Fall has always been my favorite season. The time when everything bursts with its last beauty, as if nature had been saving up all year for the grand finale.
 - I miss something I never even had.
 - Maybe hope isn’t the most dangerous thing a person can have. Maybe love is.
 - To die trying would be better than to die without purpose.
 - I shake my head, watching snow tumble and swirl from an all-white sky. The world seems so clean if you only look up.
 - In another time, in another place, I wonder who they might have been.
 - We destroy things with our curiosity. We shatter with our best intentions.
 - It was a terrible decision, and I confess I’d make it again.

 - I don’t have too many books, I have too little shelving.
 - But instead of tears, when I press my face against the pillow, a horrible, primal scream comes out of me. It’s unlike anything I thought myself capable of. Rage, unlike anything I’ve ever known.
 - It isn’t a perfect place. There are no perfect places. But nobody cares about perfection when there are sand castles to build and kites to chase, children that are being born, old hearts that are giving in.
 - Maybe it is desperation. Maybe we can’t let things fall apart without trying. We can’t let go of the people we love.
 - I don’t dare touch her. Loss is a knowledge I’m sorry to have. Perhaps the only thing worse than experiencing it, is watching it replay anew in someone else – all the awful stages picking up like a chorus that has to be sung.
 - It’s quiet for a while, and then Rowan says; “We could talk now. We’re alone out here. No walls.” “There are always walls.” I say.
 - The trick was looking past the illusion, because the exit was never as far away as it seemed.
 - There’s a world out there that nobody has bothered to promise her.
 - The only characters I ever don’t like are ones that leave no impression on me. And I don’t write characters that leave no impression on me.

 - He gathers me up and I’m weightless before he sets me on the railing. He’s the only thing keeping me from falling back, out of the reach of daylight. I’m not afraid of falling. I don’t fear the sky beyond the train tracks like I did before. I can go anywhere just so long as it’s with him.
 - I think she’s brave. I think that nobody has ever believed what she could be capable of. All her life, nobody was listening.

 - I can almost see what Gabriel meant when he asked, ‘What has the free world got that you can’t get here?’ Almost. Freedom, Gabriel. That’s what you can’t get here.
 - Linden just wants to protect her, is what I want to say. She’s all he has. I left him. I’m at arms reach, but I’ve left him.
 - I like the idea of something greater than us. We destroy things with our curiosity. We shatter with our best intentions. We are no closer to perfection than we were one hundred years ago, or five hundred.
 - There is no choice for him but to believe. He has nothing left to give in offering.
 - My head is my favorite swimming pool.
 - I always knew I was an excellent liar; I just didn’t know that I had it in me to fool myself.
 - It was my fifth grade teacher who introduced the idea that writing could be more than a hobby for me.
 - A party in the orange grove. The pain on Linden’s face is immediate. I am unwavering. He has cost me more pain than I will ever be able to repay.
 - I’ll tell you something about true love. There’s no science to it. It’s as natural as the sky.
 - We can change so many times in our lives. We’re born into a family, and it’s the only life we can imagine, but it changes. Buildings collapse. Fires burn. And the next second we’re someplace else entirely, going through different motions and trying to keep up with this new person we’ve become.

 - I wonder if she has figured out that I’ll never love Linden, especially not in the way she does, and that he’ll never love anyone the way he loves her. I wonder if she realizes, despite all her efforts to train me, that I can never take her place.
 - I think, in this strange world of beautiful things, there may be some humanity after all.
 - Don’t forget how you got here. Don’t Forget.
 - Time was our very first king. We all live our lives to the aggressive ticking of the clock. We don’t question that our lives are a grid of seconds; even our pulses oblige. No succeeding king can hope to hold this kind of power.
 - When I am writing anything in general, I just want to tell the story that exists in my head; I don’t try to write a parable or make a point.
 - She’s been conned, ruined, left for dead, and she’s not going to forgive any of it. She will soldier on, if only out of spite.
 - Tell freedom I said hello.
 - Gabriel’s voice can reach me anywhere. Even in a hurricane.
 - I should not have loved my daughter as I did. Not in this world in which nothing lives for long. You children are flies. You are roses. You multiply and die.
 - She’s beautiful and graceful, and she is very compassionate and loyal when you aren’t responsible for the murder of her family.

 - Because even if the lie is beautiful, the truth is what you face in the end.
 - The world seems so clean if you only looked up.
 - So many of the things I’ve wanted are the things I’ve been taught to fear.
 - The seeds are tiny, unborn things, and I resent them. They’ll be planted and they’ll grow into exactly what they’re meant to be.
 - Did you tell freedom hello for me?
 - He looks at me, and I don’t know what he sees. I used to think it was Rose. But she’s not here with us now, in this room. It’s just him and me, and the books. I feel like our lives are in those books. I feel like all the words on the pages are for us.

 - A feeling can’t kill you.
 - None of the wives mention the security guards by the door, who will probably tackle us to the ground if we try to leave without our husbands.
 - We’ll squeeze every second that we can from our lives, because we’re young, and we have plenty of years to grow. We’ll grow until we’re braver. We’ll grow until our bones ache and our skin wrinkles and our hair goes white, and until our hearts decide, at last, that it’s time to stop.
 - There is warmth shooting through my broken body where there should be pain, and I put my arms around the back of his neck and I hold on to him. I hold on because you never know in this place when something good will be taken away.
 - We figure out what death means when we’re born, practically, and we live our whole lives in some kind of weird denial about it.

 - Forget who you are and what you think is there, and you’ll discover things that don’t exist to be known.
