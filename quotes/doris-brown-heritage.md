 - When you put yourself on the line in a race and expose yourself to the unknown, you learn things about yourself that are very exciting.
 - Running is a road to self-awareness and reliance-you can push yourself to extremes and learn the harsh reality of your physical and mental limitations or coast quietly down a solitary path watching the earth spin beneath your feet.
 - When you love to run and you train hard enough to really feel it, running is all about freedom. Also, I find that sharing the value of our sport is very important. When I think back on my life, it isn’t the winning that I remember so much, it’s the people who I met through running.
