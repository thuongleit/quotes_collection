 - Free will and consciousness is an illusion, and the self is a complex of memes.
 - Parapsychology seems to be growing further away from the progress and excitement of the rest of consciousness studies.
 - Certainly almost everything we do and think is colored in some way by memes, but it is important to realize that not everything we experience is a meme. If I walk down the street and see a tree, the basic perception that’s going on is not memetic.
 - Memetics provides a new approach to the evolution of language in which we apply Darwinian thinking to two replicators, not one. On this theory, memetic selection, as well as genetic selection, does the work of creating language.
 - Just as the design of our bodies can be understood only in terms of natural selection, so the design of our minds can be understood only in terms of memetic selection.

 - Take male strategies for success in the world. If you’ve got all the advantages, if you’re attractive and clever and all of that, you will generally go for very high quality females.
 - For the planet’s sake, I hope we have bird flu or some other thing that will reduce the population, because otherwise we’re doomed.
 - If you found a mammal with feathers, then you’d know that Darwin was wrong. Well, it’s rather the same with memes.
