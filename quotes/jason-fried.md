 - Unless you are a fortune-teller, long-term business planning is a fantasy.
 - What you do is what matters, not what you think or say or plan.
 - When you don’t know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious.
 - Plus, if you’re a copycat, you can never keep up. You’re always in a passive position. You never lead; you always follow. You give birth to something that’s already behind the times – just a knockoff, an inferior version of the original. That’s no way to live.
