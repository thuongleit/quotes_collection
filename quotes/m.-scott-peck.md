 - Until you value yourself, you won’t value your time. Until you value your time, you will not do anything with it.
 - The truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable, unhappy, or unfulfilled. For it is only in such moments, propelled by our discomfort, that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers.
 - Share our similarities, celebrate our differences.
 - Life is difficult. This is the great truth, one of the greatest truths-it is a great truth because once we see this truth, we transcend it.

 - Mental health is an ongoing process of dedication to reality at all costs.

 - As Benjamin Franklin said, ‘Those things that hurt, instruct.’ It is for this reason that wise people learn not to dread but actually to welcome problems and actually to welcome the pain of problems.
 - Discipline is the basic set of tools we require to solve life’s problems. Without discipline we can solve nothing. With only some discipline we can solve only some problems. With total discipline we can solve all problems.
 - Love is the free exercise of choice. Two people love each other only when they are quite capable of living without each other but choose to live with each other.
 - Genuine love not only respects the individuality of the other but actually cultivates it, even at the risk of separation or loss. The ultimate goal of life remains the spiritual growth of the individual, the solitary journey to peaks that can be climbed only alone.
 - Emotional sickness is avoiding reality at any cost. Emotional health is facing reality at any cost.

 - God wants us to become himself or herself or itself. We are growing toward Godhood. God is the goal of evolution.
 - The feeling of being valuable is a cornerstone of self-discipline because when you consider yourself valuable you will take care of yourself- including things like using your time well. In this way, self-discipline is self-caring.

 - We are most often in the dark when we are the most certain, and the most enlightened when we are the most confused.
 - Spiritually evolved people, by virtue of their discipline, mastery and love, are people of extraordinary competence, and in their competence they are called on to serve the world, and in their love they answer the call.

 - There is no act of love that is not an act of work or courage. No exceptions.
 - Community is and must be inclusive. The great enemy of community is exclusivity. Groups that exclude others because they are poor or doubters or divorced or sinners or of some different race or nationality are not communities; they are cliques – actually defensive bastions against community.
 - Often the most loving thing we can do when a friend is in pain is to share the pain-to be there even when we have nothing to offer except our presence and even when being there is painful to ourselves.
 - The only real security in life lies in relishing life’s insecurity.
 - Discipline, it has been suggested, is the means of human spiritual evolution. What provides the motive, the energy for discipline? This force I believe to be love. I define love thus: The will to extend one’s self for the purpose of nurturing one’s own or another’s spiritual growth.
 - It is only because of problems that we grow mentally and spiritually.
 - The will to grow is, in essence, the same phenomenon as love. Genuinely loving people are, by definition, growing people.
 - Listening well is an exercise of attention and by necessity hard work. It is because they do not realize this or because they are not willing to do the work that most people do not listen well.
 - Falling in love is not an extension of one’s limits or boundaries; it is a partial and temporary collapse of them.
 - Not only do self-love and love of others go hand in hand but ultimately they are indistinguishable.

 - The quickest way to change your attitude toward pain is to accept the fact that everything that happens to us has been designed for our spiritual growth.
 - Whenever we think of ourselves as doing something for someone else, we are in some way denying our own responsibility. Whatever we do is done because we choose to do it, and we make that choice because it is the one that satisfies us the most.

 - Integrity is never painless.
 - It is our task-our essential, central, crucial task-to transform ourselves from mere social creatures into community creatures.

 - There can be no vulnerability without risk; there can be no community without vulnerability; there can be no peace, and ultimately no life, without community.
 - Jesus was lonely and sorrowful and scared-an unbelievably real person.
 - Falling in love is not an act of will. It is not a conscious choice. No matter how open to or eager for it we may be, the experience may still elude us. Contrarily, the experience may capture us at times when we are definitely not seeking it, when it is inconvenient and undesirable.
 - The path to holiness lies through questioning everything.
 - When any institution becomes large and compartmentalized, with departments and subdepartments, then the conscience of the institution will often become so fragmented and diluted as to be virtually nonexistent, and the organization becomes inherently evil.
 - In and through community lies the salvation of the world.
