 - What a waste my life would be without all the beautiful mistakes I’ve made.
 - If anyone hits me, they can expect to be hit back, and harder. I never turn the other cheek because in my experience that doesn’t work.
 - I don’t want to accidentally end up looking back on my life to find that I’m ashamed of myself, I want to live a life I can be proud of.
 - My sexuality is not an inferior trait that needs to be chaperoned by emotionalism or morality.
 - If Jesus himself, or Mohammed, or Buddha spoke to me personally and said that women are inferior to men, I would still reject that as false dogma because I know with every ounce of my being that this is not true.
 - If you’re not smiling at yourself in the mirror, you probably need to check that the life you’re building is aligned to the life you dreamed for yourself. And if you’re not dreaming, you need to start dreaming.
 - The longer you live, the more dreams you should have to keep you occupied.
