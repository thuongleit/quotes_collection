 - God works in mysterious, inefficient, and breathtakingly cruel ways.
 - Behaving morally because of a hope of reward or a fear of punishment is not morality. Morality is not bribery or threats. Religion is bribery and threats. Humans have morality. We don’t need religion.
 - Religion cannot and should not be replaced by atheism. Religion needs to go away and not be replaced by anything. Atheism is not a religion. It’s the absence of religion, and that’s a wonderful thing.
 - Only Atheists have morals, the religious have reward and punishment. That’s not morality, that’s sucking up.

 - Every time something really bad happens, people cry out for safety, and the government answers by taking rights away from good people.
 - Believing there’s no God means I can’t really be forgiven except by kindness and faulty memories. That’s good; it makes me want to be more thoughtful. I have to try to treat people right the first time around.
 - The whole world is pretending the breakthrough is in technology. The bottleneck is really in art.
 - People need to be fed, medicated, educated, clothed, and sheltered, and if we’re compassionate we’ll help them, but you get no moral credit for forcing other people to do what you think is right. There is great joy in helping people, but no joy in doing it at gunpoint.

 - So many people say, ‘You know, your taxes aren’t taken by force,’ and that’s foolish. If you don’t pay your taxes and you don’t answer the warrant and you don’t go to court, eventually someone will pull a gun. Eventually someone with a gun will show up.
 - Exploration of space is worth it because humans need to explore. Knowledge is always good, and it’s a really cool thing to see.

 - Direct confrontation, direct conversation is real respect. And it’s amazing how many people get that.
 - You don’t have to be brave or a saint, a martyr, or even very smart to be an atheist. All you have to be able to say is “I don’t know”.

 - If you can just convince the dope people that the gun people are right and the gun people that the dope people are right, we could actually live in a lot more freedom.

 - Computers absolutely changed my life. Before I had a computer, I had never written one thing. Not one thing. I’m a very bad speller and I was embarrassed by that. When I would type, the little mistakes would make me nutty, and I would never edit anything.

 - I love nuts. I’m for nuts. I am nuts.
 - Jay-Z, he knows precisely who he’s going for – 14-year-old white suburban girls.
 - In music, if you hit a wrong note, people forgive you. In magic when something goes wrong, the entire art is destroyed.

 - I’m not greedy. I have love, blue skies, and Hallmark cards, and that has to be enough. It has to be enough, but it’s everything in the world – and everything in the world is plenty for me. It seems just rude to beg the invisible for more.
 - It’s fair to say that the Bible contains equal amounts of fact, history, and pizza.
 - My love of computers, besides being practical, is very direct and visceral. I love the way things look on the screen.
 - I started out as a juggler, so I know what it means to spend eight hours a day, seven days a week practicing something that people just dismiss with a wave of hand.
 - Teller and I worked Renaissance Festivals and street performing – actually more real, no kidding around, Philadelphia street performing than we did Renaissance Festivals.

 - Much better than the feeling of having things is the feeling of having earned things.

 - Twelve magicians and two carnies have been shot dead doing the bullet catch. That’s cool enough, but every night when we close our show with that trick and the loaded gun gets pointed in my face, it goes so far beyond cool. All I can think is 12 magicians, two carnies.

 - Whereas you have someone like Houdini, who works really, really hard to get really, really famous, and then has actual intellectual ideas that he puts into the culture that stay there.

 - Poker would have never gotten on TV when we only had three networks.
