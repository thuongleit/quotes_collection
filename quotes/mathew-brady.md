 - The camera is the eye of history.
 - No one will ever know what I went through to secure those negatives. The world can never appreciate it. It changed the whole course of my life.
 - I had to go. A spirit in my feet said ‘go,’ and I went.
 - My greatest aim has been to advance the art of photography and to make it what I think I have, a great and truthful medium of history.
 - From the first, I regarded myself as under obligation to my country to preserve the faces of its historic men and mothers.
