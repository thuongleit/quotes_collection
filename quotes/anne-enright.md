 - If you try to control it too much, the book is dead. You have to let it fall apart quite early on and let it start doing its own thing. And that takes nerve, not to panic that the book you were going to write is not the book you will have at the end of the day.
 - Only bad writers think that their work is really good.

 - We have lost the art of public tenderness, these small gestures of wiping and washing; we have forgotten how abjectly the body welcomes a formal touch.

 - If you can just actually let the character be for a bit, then you get the right sense.

 - I think young children in the Western middle classes are objects of incredible anxiety.
