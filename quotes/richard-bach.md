 - You will begin to touch heaven, Jonathan, in the moment that you touch perfect speed. And that isn’t flying a thousand miles an hour, or a million, or flying at the speed of light. Because any number is a limit, and perfection doesn’t have limits. Perfect speed, my son, is being there.

 - When you’re flying, an airplane doesn’t care who you are; it doesn’t care how much money you make or don’t make. All it cares about is: How well do you fly? How well do you know the airplane? How well do you know the sky?
 - We thought humble and proud at the same time, all at once in love again with this painful bittersweet lovely thing called flight.

 - That’s why love stories don’t have endings! They don’t have endings because love doesn’t end.
 - Dying is like diving into a deep lake on a hot day. There’s the shock of that sharp, cold change, the pain of it for a second, and then accepting is a swim in reality. But after so many times, even the shock wears off.
 - It is by not always thinking of yourself, if you can manage it, that you might somehow be happy. Until you make room in your life for someone as important to you as yourself, you will always be searching and lost.
 - Anybody who’s ever mattered, anybody who’s ever been happy, anybody who’s ever given any gift into the world has been a divinely selfish soul, living for his own best interest. No exceptions.

 - The meaning I picked, the one that changed my life: Overcome fear, behold wonder.
 - Laughing on the way to your execution is not generally understood by less-advanced life forms, and they call you crazy.

 - I gave my life to become the person I am right now. Was it worth it?
 - You can achieve a goal; you never really achieve your purpose, because your purpose is ongoing. It never stops.
 - Sometimes when learning comes before experience It doesn’t make sense right away.
 - The world is your exercise book, the pages on which you do your sums. It is not reality, though you may express reality there if you wish. You are also free to write lies, or nonsense, or to tear the pages.
 - Every step in every proud life is a run from safety to the dark, and the only thing to trust is what we think is true.
 - Everything is exactly as it is for a reason. The crumb on your table is no mystical reminder of this morning’s cookie, it is there because you have chosen not to remove it. No exceptions.
 - Real integrity is doing the right thing, knowing that nobody’s going to know whether you did it or not. Sooner or later, those who win are those who think they can.

 - How can we resent the life we’ve created for ourselves? Who’s to blame, who’s to credit, but us? Who can change it, any time we wish, but us?
 - Silly ideas, worth the admission price in smiles, but they’re true. Is high-energy physics interesting because it’s true or because it’s crazy?

 - The space for what you want is already filled with what you settled for instead.
 - No one does anything uncharacteristic of who they are.

 - How easy it is to be compassionate when it’s yourself you see in trouble.
 - Live enough of what you’ve always dreamed of doing, and there’s no room left for feeling bad.

 - When we put up with any situation we don’t have to put up with, it’s not because we’re dumb. We put up with it, because we want the lesson only that situation can teach, and we want it more than freedom myself.

 - I do not enjoy writing at all. If I can turn my back on an idea, out there in the dark, if I can avoid opening the door to it, I won’t even reach for a pencil.
 - I don’t think any of my books tell the reader anything new. But they do remind, in a time that is strident and screeching about the limitations of this world and all the trouble we can get ourselves into.
 - Only a few people are interested in what you have to say, but that is all right. You don’t have to tell the quality of a master by the size of his crowds.
 - As long as we believe in sequential time, we see becoming instead of being. Beyond time, we are all one.

 - I’m a writer as rarely as possible, when forced by an idea too lovely to let die unwritten.
 - I don’t think creativity is mine to maintain. It automatically comes when we declare that “I am an expression of life, and life will express itself through me in the most playful and wonderful of ways, if I let it.”

 - Anything we need to know, we can learn it from a book.

 - If we agree that the world is not what it seems, then we have an important question: What shall we do about it?
 - In the highest sense, we are all creatures of light. And I have a very difficult time talking with people who are cynical about the world. “The world is no damn good, and we’re all animals,” and that kind of thing. Well, I’m an animal.

 - Everything in this book may be wrong. – The Savior’s Manual.

 - The ideas behind the words are simple ones that work in everyday life; find what we most want to do; do it, no matter what; and in the doing be guaranteed a very difficult and a very happy lifetime.

 - I think our learning lies along the path of whatever it is we love.
 - Our disasters have been some of the best things that ever happened to us. And what we swore were blessings have been some of the worst.
