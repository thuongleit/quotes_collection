 - I believe there’s a god above me, I’m just the god of everything else!
 - Pain is joy when it cries, it’s my smile in disguise.
 - All I’m about is just the pen.
 - I just feel like I explain myself more, I’m trying to be more conscious about it, simply. Just enlightening my fans and letting them know to lock into me because I’m speaking real with them, more than anything.
 - In God we trust, the game is all us. Til the sky calls or its flames on us.
 - Sitting with the woman of your dreams and forgetting what her name is.
 - Hip-hop to me right now is really easy listening. It’s very easy listening, like there’s nothing abrasive about it. There’s no album that I put in my car that makes me roll down the windows – all the windows – and ride past the club line three times before I get out the car.
 - When I start a song, it’s the first thought. It’s the first thought and the first cadence, because that’s the most natural.
 - As a writer, you have a huge ego. You think that every line means something to everybody the same way it means to you. And that’s not true.
 - I feel like people can feel when something is natural. I think they can tell.
 - I find myself trying to explain more, and explain the perspective of my mentality, or the mentality I’m trying to convey.
 - I can’t say that music ever made me do anything.
 - No one wants to hear me over some smooth, regular beat, or just into the times. I try to do records sometimes that have a different bounce – maybe it’s a Southern bounce or something. And people shoot me all day long.
 - The fundamentals of hip-hop still play an important role, cause it’s about those similes, those metaphors, those parallels. And to some people it’s just about, “Man, I’m really relating to the lifestyle.”
 - I talk specifically to the lifestyle and those who can relate to it. And I feel like, where the creativity comes in, is where you draw the parallels that everybody can relate to. That’s where it’s creative for me. I feel like it works best that way.
 - I don’t ever want anyone to hear my music and look at it as just gratuitous violence, or hustling and money-getting – I try to tell the perspective of the woman, the man, the mind, why.
 - I didn’t come in as a writer that found producers, I came in under producers. So I’ve always respected the actual production process and producers in general.
