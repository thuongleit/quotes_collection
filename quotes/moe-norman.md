 - Winners see what they want. Losers see what they don’t want. Don’t let the game eat you; you eat the game.
 - I only see what I want to see. Winners see winning, Losers see losing. You are what you think you are.
 - What’s the longest walk in golf? It’s from the practice tee to the first tee. I don’t care if it’s 10 yards. It’s the longest walk in golf. Winners take their swing with them. Losers don’t.
 - If you want to win, but think you can’t, it’s almost certain that you won’t.
 - Every time I hit a shot, I feel like I am shaking hands with the flag stick.
 - Golf isn’t supposed to be work. It’s to have fun.
 - It’s not what the world gives you, but what you can give it. I’m lucky. I can give the world talent. I can explain it and show it to people. That’s what I love doing. I just love it.

 - Don’t say I gotta do anything in life. There is nothing you gotta do. But I want to.
