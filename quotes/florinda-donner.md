 - Freedom is the total absence of concern about yourself.
 - Freedom will cost you the mask you have on, the mask that feels so comfortable and is so hard to shed off, not because it fits so well but because you have been wearing it so long.
 - And the best way to quit being concerned with yourself is to be concerned about others.
 - It takes years for average persons in the nagualâ€™s world to remove themselves from their involvement with themselves and be capable of seeing the wonder of it all.
 - Death is your truest friend, and your most reliable adviser. If you have doubts about the course of your life, you have only to consult your death for the proper direction. Death will never lie to you.
