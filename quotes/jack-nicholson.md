 - Never rub another man’s rhubarb.
 - For a long time, I was afraid to be alone. I had to learn how to be alone. And there are still times when I think, Uh-oh! I gotta talk to somebody here or I’m gonna go crazy! But I like to be alone. Now I do. I really do. There’s a big luxury in solitude.
 - Just let the wardrobe do the acting.
 - And this, incidentally, is my thumbnail sketch of American marriage: A woman sees a man; she likes him. Now she jumps on this thing and rides it to some kind of standstill. Then she changes it and trains it, and to the exact degree that she’s able to do this, she disrespects him.

 - Charlize Theron and Cate Blanchett are very good actresses.
 - We are going as fast as we can as soon as we can. We’re in a race against time, until we run out of money.
 - You are more thoughtful because you don’t act as quickly anymore. When I turned 70 it was the first time I felt young for my age. Fifty dropped on me like a ton of bricks – there is something about that number – but when 70 came along I felt good about it.
 - Well, a younger woman is a type, but not necessarily a type for me. And what is a younger woman? I mean, I’m pretty old. Almost everyone is younger.
 - I’m definitely still wild at heart.

 - Staying together is a challenge. We all have to accept qualities in other people that aren’t always exactly what we want or need.

 - What’s beautiful is all that counts, pal. That’s ALL that counts.

 - I’m against cronyism, and I had to learn that early on. Like, I don’t have an entourage, because I saw the negative effects of those things.
 - I always knew there wasn’t going to be anybody to help me and emotionally support me, that whatever I did I’d have to do on my own.

 - I want a big 25-foot pink statue that holds my grave. Or I also might like the way the Indians did it. They hang you up on the top of a tree and the birds eat you. No, really I would probably choose cremating.

 - The most difficult thing about being well known? Getting out of a hotel room at 4am.
 - I suppose I can do more for a script as an actor than as a writer – in the film sense.
 - I think the Greeks invented sports as an antidote to philosophy. In sports there are absolute rules. It’s not, What about this? What about that? Either you’re safe or you’re out. It’s ten yards or it’s not. It’s in the hoop or out of the hoop. It’s certain.
 - Age is the first limitation on roles that I’ve ever had to encounter, and I hit that awhile ago.
 - Do you think God knew what he was doing when he created woman?
 - I love the company of people. I always have and always will, it comes with my family. But earlier in life I might have got a little nervous if I was alone for a day or two in a row. I might think, “Where are they?” Now, I just go on doing naturally what I do.

 - I did not want to be coming off the stage at the mercy of what somebody else told me I did.

 - If you want your freedom, you have to be willing to work hard to exercise it.
 - I don’t want to direct a movie as good as Antonioni, or Kubrick, or Polanski, or whoever. I want it to be my own. I think I’ve got the seed of it and, what’s more, that I can make movies that are different and informed by my taste.
 - When they say I’m a great actor, I close my ears because it’s not good for you to think that way.

 - There’s no point dwelling on what might or could have been. You just have to go forward.

 - There’s a tacit agreement today that the white male is the only legitimate target for any and all satire, criticism, and so forth. And we pretty much just accept it.
 - You have to do every movie one at a time. Trilogy is contrary to this ideology. My nightmare is to wake up and find myself the host of a TV series.

 - I don’t even own a cell phone.

 - How would I like to be seen? Very endearing, charming, intelligent, handsome.

 - Through all permutations and youthful poetry, I came to believe that the film actor was the great “literateur” of his time.

 - I don’t remember if I’ve been asked seriously to direct a picture. I understand that. I’m very good business for people as an actor and perhaps they’d rather I didn’t.
 - Comedy is much harder, it’s a lot more exacting. You can’t just be real and you can’t just use the same kind of techniques you use to fill up a regular scene.
 - It’s a slight stretch of the imagination but most people are alike in most ways so I’ve never had any trouble identifying with the character that I’m playing.

 - There is no way you can get people to believe you on screen if they know who you really are through television.
 - I want my kids to have a deep, inner feeling that it’s alright to be happy, that you don’t have to be constantly manufacturing problems that you don’t really have.
 - You can’t say, “I’m gonna make a hit movie.” You’re as dead as you could be.
 - I love women who have a strong sense of themselves because I know I have a pretty good idea of what I want out of life and I like to be around other people who are also pretty secure. It just makes things easier.
 - I don’t have any plugs or tucks but people do what they want. I look at it as mutilation.
 - I used to think that one of the great signs of security was the ability to just walk away.
 - There are major influences on us that people are not aware of. There are big lies that nobody’s willing to discuss.
 - There’s probably no one who understands Method acting better academically than I do, or actually uses it more in his work. But it’s funny – nobody really sees that. It’s perception versus reality, I suppose.
 - I’ve spent more time playing golf than anything else the last 18 years. Just wanted to be an 80s-shooter. Got there, too.

 - Because you know, down deep in my heart, when all is said and done, I still live under the illusion that basically people think of me as an up-and-coming young actor.
 - I’ve always had lots of friends who share my perspective – I guess you could say that I’m a guy who aggressively pursues his happiness.
 - I assume most of the characters I play are exactly like me.
 - I don’t believe in God now. I can still work up an envy for someone who has a faith. I can see how that could be a deeply soothing experience.
 - I just like art. I get pure pleasure from it. I have a lot of wonderful paintings, and every time I look at them I see something different.
 - I look for a director with a script he likes a lot, but I’m probably after the directors more than anything.
 - Everybody said I was good, but being known and not having a big film success is almost tougher than being completely new. It just kind of turned my life around and was definitely a highlight.
 - I sort of understood that when I first started: that you shouldn’t repeat a success. Very often you’re going to, and maybe the first time you do, it works. And you love it. But then you’re trapped.
 - Once I got started acting I loved it.
 - When I am cast in a movie where I feel that the woman’s part is more interesting, I usually start thinking about Spencer Tracy and Fred Astaire. They seem to be the most clear actors when working with women.

 - Take caution in your tone, commander. I’m a fair man, but this – heat is making me absolutely crazy.
 - Beer, it’s the best damn drink in the world.
 - Decent people shouldn’t live here. They’d be happier some place else.

 - For an actor, style comes last. You first have to implement the whole thing, but your style comes from the subconscious, which is the best part an actor brings to his work.

 - Now comes the part where I relieve you, the little people, of the burden of your failed and useless lives. But remember, as my plastic surgeon always said: if you gotta go, go with a smile.
 - Believe it or not, I supported Richard Nixon on the issue of presidential privilege. How could anyone conceive of being the president of the United States and think that every single thing that you say or do can become a part of the public record? It just seems so stupid to me.
 - If you get an impulse in a scene, no matter how wrong it seems, follow the impulse. It might be something and if it ain’t – take two!

 - I certainly knew my father. He just didn’t happen to be my biological father.
