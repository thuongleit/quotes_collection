 - The art of life lies in taking pleasures as they pass, and the keenest pleasures are not intellectual, nor are they always moral.
 - If extravagance were a fault, it would not have a place in the festivals of the gods.
 - Native ability without education is like a tree without fruit.
 - It is not abstinence from pleasures that is best, but mastery over them without being worsted.
 - Good cheer is no hindrance to a good life.
 - Those that study particular sciences, and neglect philosophy, are like Penelopeâ€™s wooers, that make love to the waiting women.
 - You can best reward a liar by believing nothing of what he says.
 - The vice lies not in entering the bordello but in not coming out.
