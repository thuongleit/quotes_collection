 - I feel more confident than ever that the power to save the planet rests with the individual consumer.
 - Zeroes are important. A million seconds ago was last week. A billion seconds ago, Richard Nixon resigned the presidency. A trillion seconds ago was 30,000 BC, and early humans were using stone tools.
 - Listen up, you couch potatoes: each recycled beer can saves enough electricity to run a television for three hours.
 - An acre of windy prairie could produce between $4,000 and 10,000 worth of electricity per year – which is far more than the value of the land’s crop of corn or wheat.
 - The sunshine that strikes American roads each year contains more energy than all the fossil fuels used by the entire world.
 - As a student of conservation biology, I believe that characteristics with survival value will ultimately prevail. There is no survival value in pessimism. If you think failure is inevitable, that view will probably become self-fulfilling.
 - Under communism, prices were not allowed to reflect economic reality. Under capitalism, prices don’t reflect ecological reality. In the long run, the capitalist flaw – if uncorrected – may prove to be the more catastrophic.
 - Asbestos, EMFs, and CFCs have given us a degree of humility. When yesterday’s “triumph of modern chemistry” turns out instead to be today’s deadly threat to the global environment, it is legitimate to ask what else we don’t know.
 - It is already too late to avoid mass starvation.

 - Earth Day gathered up those strands, and dozens more, and knitted them together in the public consciousness as “environmental” issues. The nation was pretty startled when 20 million people hit the streets. Congress, which had adjourned for the day to go back to its districts, was blown away.
 - There really wasn’t an environmental movement 30 years ago. The Sierra Club national office in 1969 consisted of one full-time volunteer.
