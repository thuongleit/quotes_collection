 - I don’t really care what people tell children – when you believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, one more fib won’t hurt. But I am infuriated by the growing notion, posited in some touchy-feely quarters, that all women are, or can be, beautiful.
 - I feel I’m trying to get this really crap car going, and it just keeps stalling on me. And then other times I feel like my life’s a train thundering toward me, and I’m in a car stuck on the crossroads and can’t get out. Isn’t it great being young!
