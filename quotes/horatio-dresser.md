 - Do your best every day and your life will gradually expand into satisfying fullness.
 - What I am thinking and doing day by day is resistlessly shaping my future â€“ a future in which there is no expiation except through my own better conduct. No one can save. No one can live my life for me. If I am wise I shall begin today to build my own truer and better world from within.
 - No one can live my life for me. If I am wise, I shall begin today to build my own truer and better world from within.
