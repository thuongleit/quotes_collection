 - I usually befriend the camera department very early on in the film and drive them nuts. I’m constantly bombarding them with questions and going through the stills photography. A film set is a great place for me and I love it.
 - If you can jump up onstage and make people laugh, shouldn’t you also be able to inhabit a character?

 - I always use the analogy that when you go to a jeans store and put on a new pair of jeans, it’s a pair of jeans and they feel different; so, when you’re dealing with these sort of costumes it’s a very big departure and really does make you feel quite different. But it’s wonderful.

 - My wife and I really, really like each other as well as love each other.
 - I’ve had frustrated storytelling juices that have been lying dormant for a long time, and I guess the documentary was a way of me telling a story that I felt most qualified to tell. And I loved it, and I’d love to do something else someday, probably more narrative-based. But I’m in no rush.
 - Throw your children in the surf and let them get used to it. They have to learn all about rips and tides and swimming between the flags and all that sort of stuff. I know that sounds ridiculous but it’s true.

 - The only thing that may make me different from other people is I have passionate interests outside of work.

 - If I read something and I love it, I’ll do it and I don’t even ask what the budget is.

 - I would never say never to returning to comedy.
 - I’ll give you a list of a hundred ways that I’m more likely to be injured than belting around a race track with people who know what they’re doing. It’s not a place where I feel I’m in unnecessary danger.
 - I don’t consciously seek out Australian projects. I put them on the same table as all the other scripts and I wouldn’t ever do a film just because it’s been shot at home.
 - There’s a plethora of wonderful documentaries. I made a point of not looking at anyone else’s portrayal of Henry because I think it would have been too confusing – so I’ve got a lot of films to look forward to.

 - If a great comedy landed on my doorstep, I would find it hard to say no.

 - We live our lives by the water and if you don’t know how to swim in Australia, it’s like not knowing how to cross a road. It’s an incredible survival thing that you really must learn when you’re a child.
 - When I was a kid, I would do stupid things on my bike. I’d jump any ramp, I’d jump over people, I’d jump over things – always crashing, never hurting myself badly but always wanting to take physical risks.
 - I wanted to be a mechanic. When I was 14 I wanted to quit school and go work on my car. But my dad said Son, you shouldn’t do that. You should stay in school until your education is finished, and when you’re done, don’t make your hobby your job.
 - The reason my kids come to the set is so I can actually see them.

 - I think if you had to map that out at the beginning and you said, “Right, sit down, this is what you’re going to be doing,” you’d probably freak out. But I’m someone who really enjoys not being himself. So if you consider that, then it all sort of makes sense.
 - The more I love the character, the harder it is to get it wrong. I have to get to a point that I can speak for them.

 - I never look at the size of the film when I’m looking for a part.
 - I’ve given no thought to moving to America at all.
 - I’m realistic about it. It’s been quite some years since I’ve worked full-time in that area, so I no longer have any material that bears any relevance to my life or the audience. I’d need to take probably a year off, which I wouldn’t be prepared to do, so it’s a romantic ideal.
