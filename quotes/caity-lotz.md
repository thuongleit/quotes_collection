 - I’ve danced my whole life. Martial arts is just fun for me, it’s all choreographed a bit like dance. I have done Muay Thai and Wushu, which is cool because it’s very fluid dance. I also do Tricking. It’s kind of like Taekwondo with the big kicks and flips and showier aspects of martial arts.
 - Wittiness turns me on more than anything else.
