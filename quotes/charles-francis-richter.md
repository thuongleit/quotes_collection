 - I have a sense of humor; but over the years that sense has developed one blind spot. I can no longer laugh at ignorance or stupidity. Those are our chief enemies, and it is dangerous to make fun of them.
 - As seismologists gained more experience from earthquake records, it became obvious that the problem could not be reduced to a single peak acceleration. In fact, a full frequency of vibrations occurs.
 - The laboratory routine, which involves a great deal of measurement, filing, and tabulation, is either my lifeline or my chief handicap, I hardly know which.
 - Nothing is less predictable than the development of an active scientific field.
 - It is a common remark that men talk most who think least; just as frogs cease their quacking when a light is brought to the water-side.

 - My main point today is that usually one gets what one expects, but very rarely in the way one expected it.
 - If the assumptions used in calculating energy are changed, then this seriously affects the final result, even though the same body of data might be used.
 - I would walk – not run – to the nearest seismograph.
 - If one introduces the concept of energy of an earthquake then that is a theoretically derived quantity.
