 - Forgiveness flounders because I exclude the enemy from the community of humans and myself from the community of sinners.
 - The difference between justice and forgiveness: To be just is to condemn the fault and, because of the fault, to condemn the doer as well. To forgive is to condemn the fault but to spare the doer. That’s what the forgiving God does.
 - To triumph fully, evil needs two victories, not one. The first victory happens when an evil deed is perpetrated; the second victory, when evil is returned. After the first victory, evil would die if the second victory did not infuse it with new life.
 - Honoring everyone contains the promise of possibility.
 - Christ’s indwelling presence has freed us from exclusive orientation toward ourselves and opened us up in two directions: toward God, to receive the good things in faith, and toward our neighbor, to pass them on in love.
 - Theology is not only about understanding the world; it is about mending the world.

 - Whatever the reasons, when forgiveness happens it is always a miracle of grace. The obstacles in its way are immense.
 - If I say, ‘I forgive you,’ I have implicitly said you have done something wrong to me. But what forgiveness is at its heart is both saying that justice has been violated and not letting that violation count against the offender.
 - Prejudice is a form of untruthfulness, and untruthfulness is an insidious form of injustice.
 - In a way, fraud in business is no different from infidelity in marriage or plagiarism in scholarly work. Even people committed to high moral standards succumb.
 - I do believe that Muslims and Christians and Jews pray to the same God. And yet they understand who God is in significantly different ways.
 - Christians believe that there will be a Judgment Day at the end. And it is my belief that on that day justice will be done and there will be a reconciliation between those who have profoundly injured one another takes place.
 - The goal of pursuit of justice must not simply be that justice happens but that reconciliation also happens.
 - If you take the ‘love your enemy’ out of Christianity, you’ve ‘unChristianed’ the Christian faith.
 - Every word and every deed, every thought and every gesture, even the simple act of paying attention can be a gift and therefore an echo of God’s life in us.
