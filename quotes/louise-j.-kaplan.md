 - During adolescence imagination is boundless. The urge toward self-perfection is at its peak. And with all their self- absorption and personalized dreams of glory, youth are in pursuit of something larger than personal passions, some values or ideals to which they might attach their imaginations.
 - Adolescence is the conjugator of childhood and adulthood.
 - Adolescence is a time of active deconstruction, construction, reconstruction – a period in which past, present, and future are rewoven and strung together on the threads of fantasies and wishes that do not necessarily follow the laws of linear chronology.
 - Adolescence represents an inner emotional upheaval, a struggle between the eternal human wish to cling to the past and the equally powerful wish to get on with the future.
 - Paradoxically, the toddler’s “No” is also a preliminary to his saying yes. It is a sign that he is getting ready to convert his mother’s restrictions and prohibitions into the rules for behavior that will belong to him.
 - From the beginning moments of life, the urges for each of us to become a self in the world are there – in the liveliness of our innate growth energies, in the vitality of our stiffening-away muscles, in our looking eyes, our listening ears, our reaching-out hands.
 - Hopefulness is the heartbeat of the relationship between a parent and child. Each time a child overcomes the next challenge of hislife, his triumph encourages new growth in his parents. In this sense a child is parent to his mother and father.
 - Normally an infant learns to use his mother as a “beacon of orientation” during the first five months of life. The mother’s presence is like a fixed light that gives the child the security to move out safely to explore the world and then return safely to harbor.
 - Children, even infants, are capable of sympathy. But only after adolescence are we capable of compassion.
 - It didn’t take elaborate experiments to deduce that an infant would die from want of food. But it took centuries to figure out that infants can and do perish from want of love.
 - Adolescents are the bearers of cultural renewal, those cycles of generation and regeneration that link our limited individual destinies with the destiny of the species.
 - Schoolchildren make up their own rules and enforce their own conformities. They feel safest when leisure time is rationed and dosed. They like to wear uniforms, and they frown on personal idiosyncrasies. Deviance is the mark of an outsider.
 - Fathers represent another way of looking at life – the possibility of an alternative dialogue.
 - The toddler must say no in order to find out who she is. The adolescent says no to assert who she is not.
 - Adolescence is the time to enlarge the natural sentiments of pity, friendship, and generosity, the time to develop an understanding of human nature and the varieties of human character, the time to gain insight into the strengths and weaknesses of all men and to study the history of mankind.
 - A man’s fatherliness is enriched as much by his acceptance of his feminine and childlike strivings as it is by his memories of tender closeness with his own father. A man who has been able to accept tenderness from his father is able later in life to be tender with his own children.
