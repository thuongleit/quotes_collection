 - I like engineering, but I love the creative input.
 - It’s easy to create something that has a lot of luster, but it’s very hard to make something that has a lot of depth.
 - You had to make a camera look like it’s traveling at 300 mph, but you couldn’t make it actually travel at 300 mph so you had to slow everything down and build devices to do that. So you were constantly engineering.
 - Digital imaging has untied our hands with regards to technical limitations. We no longer have to be arbiters of technology; we get to participate in the interpretation of technology into creative content.
 - If you can imagine it, we can make it.
 - If you understand how the real world feels and looks and sounds it is much easier to create a virtual version of the real world.
 - George Lucas wanted this moving camera for all of the photography in Star Wars. He was willing to take a risk with the concepts that I advanced with regard to ways for doing that.
 - In the first Spider-Man, at the end of the movie, Peter Parker had to deny himself a relationship with a girl that he’s in love with. The very next thing that happens is that he’s swinging through the city.
 - Because I come from that old-school optics environment, I know stuff about depth of field and camera movement and things that are not necessarily a part of the curriculum for people who started on a box and have never done anything that wasn’t on a box.
 - Boy, am I glad there wasn’t a fourth episode of Lord of the Rings.
 - Once the image was in the digital environment, one of the problems was, we had no means to reproduce the color spectrum, grey scale, and contrast that film produces, without converting the digital file to film, evaluating it, then going back and changing the digital image.
 - I come from an era when we had to figure out how to bolt a camera to a motorcycle or an airplane or dig a hole and find a canyon deep enough to repel into it so that we can capture images that were real.
 - I think that era of mechanically figuring out of how to bring a particular evocative image to the screen was a really important part of my education.
 - I was involved in the color correction and the digital color correction. In an odd way, you end up making a film many times-the DVD, the archival record of a high-definition master, and so on.
 - I had done a lot of rock ‘n’ roll photography when I was in college. I was one of many photographers who worked for The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and all of these rock ‘n’ roll bands.
 - It’s very much like filmmaking always is-you’re always asked to do something that you’re not sure you know how to do. So you make an educated guess as to what you think will work and you hope between that and plan B, that you can end up with a product that’s really good.
 - Human beings are really attuned to their senses. When you work in film, you are working with the visual and audio senses. An understanding of tactile and other components that go into the creation of those objects are important to making them look real on screen, like a plasma of energy.
 - As with sound, images are subjective. You and I may not see the same color red as red, but we will probably agree that the image on the screen is a digital image or film image, based on contrast, bit depth, and refresh rate.
