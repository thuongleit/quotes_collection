 - I really do feel like I know myself, and I’m so happy to be by myself and I’m so happy to be with other people; I just know myself really, really well, and I think that is an amazing thing. I think a lot of people don’t know themselves that well.

 - Although I was born in Idaho and now live in New York, I definitely identify with the European aesthetic. Paris is my mecca; it’s where I discovered my flair for fashion. But I pay rent and work in New York, so that is my home – I love the culture clash of the city.

 - I was scouted when I was, like, sixteen, and I hated it. I wasn’t ready to work. When I turned 19, I decided to move to Paris to pursue modeling for myself there. It was kind of a way to get out of the house and discover something for myself, in a way.
