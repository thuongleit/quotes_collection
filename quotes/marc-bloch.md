 - The historian is, by definition, absolutely incapable of observing the facts which he examines.
 - The good historian is like the giant of the fairy tale. He knows that wherever he catches the scent of human flesh, there his quarry lies.
 - But history is neither watchmaking nor cabinet construction. It is an endeavor toward better understanding.
 - The nature of our intelligence is such that it is stimulated far less by the will to know than by the will to understand.
 - History is, in its essentials, the science of change. It knows and it teaches that it is impossible to find two events that are ever exactly alike, because the conditions from which they spring are never identical.
 - Thenceforth they thought that, rationally concluded, doubt could become an instrument of knowledge.
