 - I canâ€™t stop while there are lives to be saved.
 - I have no fear nor shrinking; I have seen death so often that it is not strange or fearful to me.
 - Someday, somehow, I am going to do something useful, something for people. They are, most of them, so helpless, so hurt and so unhappy.
 - Patriotism alone is not enough.
 - Nothing but physical impossibility, lack of space and money would make me close my doors to Allied refugees.
 - I realize that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred toward any one.
