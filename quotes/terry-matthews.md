 - The single most important route of success is persistence – never, ever give up!
 - And that’s the secret. Timing, hard work and smart partners. Using that formula, I’ve either founded or funded over 80 companies, and none have gone bankrupt. Most have done very well.
 - I don’t think I’m stubborn. I just focus on the task at hand and do what it takes. Persistence is the single most important thing for success.
 - Make a mark; don’t be part of the living dead.
