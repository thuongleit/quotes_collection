 - We live in a world populated by structures â€“ a complex mixture of geological, biological, social, and linguistic constructions that are nothing but accumulations of materials shaped and hardened by history.
 - Emergent properties result from interactions between individual parts, so it follows that a top down analytical approach that begins with the whole and dissects it into its constituent parts is bound to miss precisely those emergent properties.
 - Any materialist philosophy must take as its point of departure the existence of a material world that is independent of our minds.
