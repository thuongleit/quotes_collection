 - The world doesn’t just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?
 - The thrill of coming home has never changed.
 - Just because there are things I don’t remember, doesn’t mean my actions are meaningless. The whole world doesn’t just disappear when you close your eyes, does it?
 - I suffer from overheating quite easily.
 - If I’m exhausted, physically and particularly emotionally, I can’t tell what’s good and I can’t tell what’s bad and I’m useless.
 - I always look at films as real stories with real people in real situations. That’s why I struggle with the whole notion of calling someone the ‘good guy’ or the ‘bad guy,’ because I think we all have potential to do good things and all have the potential to do bad things.
 - There’s a sense of humor within the Australian culture that prevails when one is in a rather difficult situation.

 - I feel I do my best work when it’s all there on the page, and I feel that the character is very vivid as I read the script and I’m not having to create stuff and trying to cobble together something. If I have to do that, then I don’t entirely trust what I’m doing.
 - I had to put the word out to people that I didn’t cost a fortune, and I was prepared to work at home. Because that’s the assumption: “Well, he lives in America now, we can’t afford him, we won’t bother.”

 - I want to bring something different to every film. I get a bit tired of actors who kind of are the same character in every film that they do.

 - I grew up doing musicals. I’ve done so many musicals in my life, I kind of got them out of my system. But, I certainly would be open to them. Rocky Horror Show is a big favorite of mine.
 - I really enjoy doing things that are more subtle and close to home – and literally close to home.
 - I do like a variety of things so I’m always interested in finding something that I haven’t done before, if possible, to whatever degree that sometimes changes, and how much is something now that I wouldn’t have a year ago but sort of based on what I’ve done recently as well.

 - I don’t feel I’m making a conscious effort to go more commercial.
 - The funny thing is, because I was doing a lot of theater when I was a kid, and a lot of that was musical theater, as I got older I became more interested in acting as a separate entity and music as a separate entity, like songwriting and production and recording and playing music.
 - I don’t have many friends.
