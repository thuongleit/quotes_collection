 - Absence makes the heart grow fonder. Prolonged absence makes the heart forget.
 - Friends depart, and memory takes them To her caverns, pure and deep.
 - Tell me the tales that to me were so dear, Long, long ago, long, long ago.
 - I’d be a butterfly; living a rover, Dying when fair things are fading away.
 - Oh, pilot! ’tis a fearful night, There’s danger on the deep.
 - Surely ’t is better, when summer is over To die when all fair things are fading away.
 - The mistletoe hung in the castle hall, The holly branch shone on the old oak wall.
 - Oh! where do fairies hide their heads, When snow lies on the hills, When frost has spoiled their mossy beds, And crystallized their rills?
 - Why don’t the men propose, Mamma? Why don’t the men propose?
 - Those that have wealth must be watchful and wary, Power, alas! naught but misery brings!
 - I’m saddest when I sing.
 - Fear not, but trust in Providence, Wherever thou may’st be.
 - Oh, I have roamed o’er many lands, And many friends I’ve met; Not one fair scene or kindly smile Can this fond heart forget.
