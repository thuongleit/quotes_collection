 - If I don’t have an erection when I’m doing a drawing, I know it’s no good.
 - I almost never draw a completely naked man. He has to have at least a pair of boots or something on. To me, a fully dressed man is more erotic than a naked one. A naked man is, of course beautiful, but dress him in black leather or a uniform – ah, then he is more than beautiful, then he is sexy!
 - I know my little ‘dirty drawings’ are never going to hang in the main salons of the Louvre, but it would be nice if – I would like to say ‘when,’ but I better say ‘if’ – our world learns to accept all the different ways of loving. Then maybe I could have a place in one of the smaller side rooms.
 - My whole life long I have done nothing but interpret my dreams of ultimate masculinity, and draw them.
