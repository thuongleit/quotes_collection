 - It’s no one’s fault to be born ugly, but, honestly, must it be worn as a symbol of pride?
 - I never think about age. I believe your age is totally how you feel. I’ve seen women of thirty-five who are old and people of seventy-five who are young. As long as I look after myself physically, mentally and emotionally, I’ll stay young.
 - I’ve always maintained that there is a very fine line between a daring, sexy older woman and mutton dressed as lamb.
 - Love may be a dream but marriage is a nightmare.
 - I think bare legs in winter are idiotic. Unless your naked pins are toned, tanned and veinless, it’s best to cover up. There is nothing more elegant in winter than dark tights worn with matching knee-length boots and a belted trench coat.

 - The body is like a car: the older you become the more care you have to take care of it – and you don’t leave a Ferrari out in the sun.

 - I was so fortunate to work closely with the designer Nolan Miller whilst on ‘Dynasty’ to create the wardrobe for Alexis Carrington Colby, and we had great fun sourcing outfits.

 - My grandmother spoiled my father rotten, and he grew up expecting women to do whatever he wanted. When he married my beautiful mother, Elsa, he expected her to give up her career as a champion ballroom dancer and become a good wife and mother, which she dutifully did.
 - All of a sudden I found myself with the reputation of being a swinger and a home-wrecker. Beverly Hills wives were supposed to live in fear in case I cast my green orbs in the direction of their men. Ninety-nine per cent of this was total fabrication.
 - Doing 20 minutes of stretching, light weights and floor exercises three times a week takes the same amount of time as a long coffee break – and eating a tuna fish salad, sardines on toast or scrambled eggs is surely preferable to a Big Mac or KFC.

 - Botox, I think, is poison, I would never put it into my face, and I’m needle-phobic. I spend a lot of time keeping my face out of the sun and taking care of my skin and wearing make-up.
 - If you feel well and happy, your face will reflect this, but if you are down in the dumps and having a miserable time, your face will soon show this, too. In fact, you get the face you deserve by the time you’re forty, and one of the keys to looking and feeling younger is being active.

 - However much some journalists may criticize me, I know that I look, feel, and behave several decades younger than my actual age, and much of that is because I believe you are what you think you are. This is called positive affirmation, and it’s a really strong tool.
 - I’ve said no to ‘Celebrity Big Brother,’ ‘Strictly,’ and the American one, ‘Dancing With The Stars.’ I don’t feel it’s right for me. I’ve been asked to do reality TV a zillion times. No way. No way. Nobody’s going to get into my living room and see me there.
 - My mother was a domestic goddess and Mother Earth figure. She was sweet and placid – just what the perfect wife was supposed to be and I was determined not to be.
 - Yes, I remember the bombings. Yes, I remember, because – yes, I remember being in air raid shelters. Even though I was evacuated because I was very young, I remember being in air raid shelters and the tremendous feeling of compatibility with everybody.

 - Making each day a mini lifetime – to achieve something and to enjoy something.
 - Dynasty was the opportunity to take charge of my career rather than waiting around like a library book waiting to be loaned out.
 - I used to not be confident. My father certainly didn’t add to my confidence. When I was 17 or 18, I was voted the most beautiful girl in England by the association of press photographers. When they called Daddy for a comment, he said, ‘I’m amazed. She’s a nice looking girl, but nothing special.’
