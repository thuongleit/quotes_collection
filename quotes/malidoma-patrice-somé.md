 - The power of nature exists in its silence. Human words cannot encode the meaning because human language has access only to the shadow of meaning.
 - The spiritual thirst that is latent in everybody can never come to a place of fulfillment unless people begin to think of each other as potential brothers and sisters.
 - Our souls do not like stagnation. Our souls aspire toward growth, that is, toward remembering all that we have forgotten due to our trip to this place, the earth.
