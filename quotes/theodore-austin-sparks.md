 - Christianity is not a doctrine, not truth as truth, but the knowledge of a Person; it is knowing the Lord Jesus. You cannot be educated into being a Christian.
 - Seek to have your life in God, not in things, not in people, not in places, not in circumstances, not in arguments, not in human intelligence, but in God.
 - The mark of a life governed by the Holy Spirit is that such a life is continually and ever more and more occupied with Christ, that Christ becomes greater and greater as time goes on.
 - You cannot go outside of A and Z in the realm of literature; likewise Christ Jesus is First and Last of Godâ€™s new creation, and all that is in between; you cannot get outside of that.
