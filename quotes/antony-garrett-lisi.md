 - I think the universe is pure geometry – basically, a beautiful shape twisting around and dancing over space-time.
 - Science is our last and greatest frontier.
 - My father raised me to think independently and follow my own path in life.
 - The mathematics of quantum mechanics very accurately describes how our universe works. And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities, just like a coral.
 - It’s hard to figure out the secrets of the universe when you’re trying to figure out where you and your girlfriend are going to sleep next month.
 - What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry and the interactions of elementary particles. And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.
 - Everything that can happen, does. That’s quantum mechanics. But this does not mean everything happens. The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can’t.
 - Yeah, I am a guy working on physics outside of academia. But I’m nowhere near Einstein’s caliber.
 - The only thing that makes sense is if the universe is beautiful and simple and elegant.
 - You cannot think when you’re ecstatic.
 - Ninety-five per cent of my time is virtually wasted.
 - Surfing is simply the most fun I know how to have on this planet.
 - Math does come easily to me, but I was always much more interested in what theorems imply about the world than in proving them.
 - My friends are all geeks. And many of them are scientists who love playing outside as much as I do.
 - There are a lot of good things about string theory, and it’s great that some people want to work on it.
 - Coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal. Each coral head consists of thousand of individual polyps. These polyps are continually budding and branching into genetically identical neighbors.
 - Deep down, everybody wants to do what they want to be doing. They just feel that they can’t.
 - I always found it satisfying that gravity was described by Einstein’s geometric theory of general relativity.
