 - The route to the target is more important than the target. We are going to go for the target, but we enjoy the route as well.
 - The world looks marvelous from up here, so peaceful, so wonderful and so fragile. Everybody, all of us down there, not only in Israel, have to keep it clean and good.
 - The quiet that envelops space makes the beauty even more powerful, and I only hope that the quiet can one day spread to my country.
