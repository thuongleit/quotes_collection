 - The dues of discipleship are high indeed, and how much we can take so often determines how much we can then give.
 - When we are unduly impatient with an omniscient God’s timing, we really are suggesting that we know what’s best. Strange isn’t it-we who wear wrist watches seek to counsel Him who oversees cosmic clocks and calendars.

 - Regarding trials, including of our faith and patience, there are no exemptions-only variations.
 - When we don’t like to face up to hard facts, we use soft words. We do not speak about killing a baby within the womb, but about “termination of potential life.” Words are often multiplied to try to cover dark deeds.

 - Selfishness is much more than an ordinary problem because it activates all the cardinal sins! It is the detonator in the breaking of the Ten Commandments.
 - Though we live in a failing world, we have not been sent here to fail.

 - When great individuals move so marvelously along the straight and narrow path, it is unseemly of us to call attention to the fact that one of their shoelaces is untied as they make the journey.
 - Oh, how great the plan of our God!
 - In one degree or another we all struggle with selfishness. Since it is so common, why worry about selfishness anyway? Because selfishness is really self-destruction in slow motion.

 - The laughter of the world is merely loneliness pathetically trying to reassure itself.
