 - You can’t take it with you – but you can send it on ahead.
 - Real gold fears no fire.

 - Hell is not evil; it’s a place where evil gets punished. Hell is not pleasant, appealing, or encouraging. But Hell is morally good, because a good God must punish evil.

 - A disciple does not ask, “How much can I keep?” but, “How much more can I give?” Whenever we start to get comfortable with our level of giving, it’s time to raise it again.
 - God is the greatest giver in the universe, He won’t let you outgive Him.
 - Not only will we see His face and live, but we will likely wonder if we ever lived before we saw His face!
 - The greatest deterrent to giving is the illusion that this earth is our home.
 - Someday this upside-down world will be turned right side up. Nothing in all eternity will turn it back again. If we are wise, we will use our brief lives on earth positioning ourselves for the turn.
 - Ironically, many people can’t afford to give precisely because they’re not giving. If we pay our debt to God first, then we will incur His blessing to help us pay our debts to men. But when we rob God to pay men, we rob ourselves of God’s blessing.

 - Seeking happiness apart from a right relationship God is like trying to turn on a light that’s unplugged.
 - Earth is a in-between world touched by both Heaven and Hell. Earth leads directly into Heaven or directly into Hell, affording a choice between the two. The best of life on Earth is a glimpse of Heaven; the worst of life is a glimpse of Hell.
 - In the midst of prosperity, the challenge for believers is to handle wealth in such a way that it acts as a blessing, not a curse.

 - God is grooming us for leadership. He’s watching to see how we demonstrate our faithfulness. He does that through his apprenticeship program, one that prepares us for Heaven. Christ is not simply preparing a place for us; he is preparing us for that place.
 - If you’re a child of God, you do not just “go around once” on Earth. You don’t get just one earthly life. You get another-one far better and without end. You’ll inhabit the New Earth! You’ll live with the God you cherish and the people you love as an undying person on an undying Earth.

 - Countless mistakes in marriage, parenting, ministry, and other relationships are failures to balance grace and truth. Sometimes we neglect both. Often we choose one over the other.

Although there are no laws against such abuse – no man-made laws anyway – this spiritual mistreatment may result in as much long-term personal and social damage as the worst physical abuse.
 - You and I are characters in God’s Story, handmade by Him. Every character serves a purpose.

 - It’s a law of life: the tyranny of things.
 - Tomorrow’s character is made out of today’s thoughts. Temptation may come suddenly, but sin does not.

 - Shouldn’t we suppose that many of our most painful ordeals will look quite different a million years from now, as we recall them on the New Earth?
