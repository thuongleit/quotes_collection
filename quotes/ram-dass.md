 - Be here now.
 - The quieter you become, the more you can hear.
 - We’re all just walking each other home.
 - Information is just bits of data. Knowledge is putting them together. Wisdom is transcending them.
 - Suffering only shows where you are attached. That is why, to those on the path, suffering is grace.

 - Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It’s not ‘I love you’ for this or that reason, not ‘I love you if you love me.’ It’s love for no reason, love without an object.
 - You have all the time in the world, but don’t waste a moment.
 - Within the spiritual journey you understand that suffering becomes something that has been given to you to show you where your mind is still stuck. It’s a vehicle to help you go to work. That’s why it’s called grace.

 - Most of us are convinced that we are our egos, which is who we think we are. The ego is part of our incarnation. It dies with the body, which is why we are so afraid of death. Death scares the hell out of who you think you are, especially if you think you are this body.

 - The way we regard death is critical to the way we experience life. When your fear of death changes, the way you live your life changes.
 - Our thinking minds deprive us of the happiness that comes when we are living fully in the moment.
