 - Some people bring out the worst in you, others bring out the best, and then there are those remarkably rare, addictive ones who just bring out the most. Of everything. They make you feel so alive that you’d follow them straight into hell, just to keep getting your fix.
 - Truth hurts. But lies can kill.
 - Bedevil the devil and devil be dammed. I fear no devil and bow to no man. – Adam Black.
 - I love books, by the way, way more than movies. Movies tell you what to think. A good book lets you choose a few thoughts for yourself.
 - I lock eyes with my reflection and don’t look away. The day you look away you start to lose yourself. I’m never going to lose myself. You are what you are. Deal with it or change.
 - Assume’ makes an ‘ass’ out of ‘u’ and ‘me’.
 - Hope strengthens. Fear kills.
 - The most confused we ever get is when we’re trying to convince our heads of something our heart knows is a lie.
 - If you are not with me, you are against me. I have no mercy for my enemies.
 - Its our actions that define us. What we choose. What we resist. What we’re willing to die for.
 - You can’t save people from themselves. You can only try to wake them up.
 - Your feet will bring you to where your heart is.
 - Who and what we surround ourselves with is who and what we become. In the midst of good people, it is easy to be good. in the midst of bad people, it is easy to be bad.
 - Time heals. No, it doesn’t. At best, time is the great leveler, sweeping us all into coffins. We find ways to distract ourselves from the pain. Time is neither scalpel nor bandage. It is indifferent. Scar tissue is not a good thing. It is merely the wound’s other face.
 - Strength wasn‘t about being able to do everything alone. Strength was knowing when to ask for help and not being too proud to do it.
 - If you weaken, I’ll be strong. If you get lost, I’ll be your way home. If you despair, I’ll bring you joy. I will love you until the end of time.
 - Some things are sacred. Until you act like they’re not. Then you lose them.
 - You’re leaving me, Rainbow Girl.
 - You believe in God? Dude. Only God could have created physics.
 - Good and evil are merely opposite sides of a coin. Get tossed in the air enough, it’s easy to come down on the wrong side.
 - Life is too hard, too much to handle. Nobody told me there’d be days like these. How could nobody tell me there’d be days like these? How could they let me grow up like that – happy and pink and stupid?
 - Don’t lose yourself to anger. It’s gasoline. You can burn it as fuel, or you can use it to torch everything you care about and end up standing on a scorched battlefield, with everybody dead, even you-only your body doesn’t have the good grace to quit breathing.
 - One day you will kiss a man you can’t breathe without, and find that breath is of little consequence.
 - Desire makes life happen. Makes it matter. Makes everything worth it. Desire is life. Hunger to see the next sunrise or sunset, to touch the one you love, to try again. “Hell would be waking up and wanting nothing,” he agrees.
 - Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever.
 - He pulls me around and kisses me. “You’re Mac,” he says. “And I’m Jericho. And nothing else matters. Never will. You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that?” I do. Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.
 - Nobody looks good in their darkest hour. But it’s those hours that make us what we are. We stand strong, or we cower. We emerge victorious, tempered by our trails, or fracture by a permanent, damning fault line.
 - The wound you refuse to dress is one that will never heal. You gush lifeblood and never even know why. It will make you weak at a critical moment when you need to be strong.
 - It’s often only in the lies we refuse to speak that any truth can be heard at all.
 - You can’t go forward if you’re looking backward. You run into walls that way.
 - Safety is a fence, and fences are for sheep. I would rather die at twenty-two, knowing the truth, then live in a cage of lies for a hundred years.
 - The entire time I’m burning in Hell, I’ll regret each tear I made you weep. But if Hell were the price for twenty days with you, I’d condemn myself again and again. – Cian MacKeltar.
 - See me when you look at me.
 - You hated my rainbows, now you don’t like my leather. Is there anything you like on me?
 - Love knows no right or wrong. Love is. Only is.
 - Sometimes my dreams feel so real it’s hard to believe they’re just the subconscious’s stroll across a whimsical map that has no true north.
 - There’s no point in fighting the tide. It ebbs. It flows. You ride it.
 - I miss her. I don’t know how to live without her. There is a hole inside me that nothing fills. If you don’t find something to fill that hole, someone else will. And if someone else fills it, they own you. Forever. You’ll never get yourself back.
 - But then we so rarely understand the value of what we possess until it’s gone.
 - Evil is a completely different creature, Mac. Evil is bad that believes it’s good.
 - Caring is love. And love fights! Love doesn’t look for the path of least resistance.
 - Never underestimate a well-dressed bimbo.
 - Nobody looks good in their darkest hours. But it’s those hours that make us what we are.
 - Grief shared was grief lessened.
 - I’d rather live a hard life of fact than a sweet life of lies.
 - Some people fall apart when they get hurt. Puddle into apathy and despair and never recover. They wait all their lives for someone to come along and rescue them.
 - Every time I think I’m getting wiser, more in control of my actions, I go slamming into a situation that makes me excruciatingly aware that all I’ve succeeded in doing is swapping one set of delusions for a more elaborate, attractive set of delusions.
 - Once, long ago in her world, a sunny day in spring was her favorite, but now a sunny day in winter delights her more. It is the perfect metaphor for their love. Sunshine on ice. She warms his frost. He cools her fever.
 - There are only shades of gray. Black and white are nothing more than lofty ideals in our minds, the standards by which we try to judge things, and map out our place in the world in relevance to them.
 - She loves. And she doesn’t know how to pull it back when you have to, because sometimes you sure as feck have to. Got to grab it up with both hands and pull it back before somebody turns into knives and uses it to cut you to pieces.
 - I’m his locomotive and he’s my shield.
 - It’s a strange new world out there and the rules have changed: It’s every princess for herself.
 - The battle had been invisible to the naked eye, but the hardest ones are.
 - I’m sorry your pretty little world got all screwed up, but everybody’s does, and you go on. It’s how you go on that defines you.
 - Unpredictable as a hungry lion, he might be feared by everyone else, but he never ripped out my throat, only licked me, and, if his tongue was a little rough sometimes, it was worth it to walk beside the king of the jungle.
 - Beautiful women rarely possess sufficient depth of character to survive without their pretty feathers.
 - You were firing questions at me today, trying to get inside my head. You asked if I believe in God. I told you of course I do – I’ve always had a strong sense of self.
 - Regardless of how many people I surrounded myself with, no matter how many friends and family I loved and was loved by in return, I was alone at the moment of being born and at the moment of dying. Nobody came with you and nobody went with you. It was a journey of one.
 - And when he did that, my hands curled into fists because I thought about touching his face like maybe I could catch joy in my hands and hold it.
 - Yesterday was a memory. Tomorrow was a hope. Today was another day to live and do one’s best to love.
 - I love re-creating myself. Change means you get to choose again. Become something new. -Dani.
 - Even I don’t know what you’re doing, and I know everything.
 - I didn’t ask. Some things are better left unsaid. He looked at me and I shivered. I never get enough of him. Never will. He lives. I breathe. I want. Him. Always. Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever. Later we would go to bed, and when he rose over me, dark and vast and eternal, I’d know joy.
 - I like sex for breakfast, kid. I eat early and often.
 - I am a kite in a tornado but I have a long string. There is tension in my line. Somewhere, someone is holding onto the other end and, although it cannot spare me this storm, it will not let me be lost while I regain my strength. It is enough.
 - My heart has jet lag.
 - I’m not the hero, Mac. Never have been. Never will be. Let us be perfectly clear: I’m not the antihero, either, so quit waiting to discover my hidden potential. There’s nothing to redeem me.
 - I’m here. You’re safe now. It’s okay to remember. They can never hurt you again.
 - Valhalla on the right. Paradise regained on the left. Stuck between a Godiva truffle and a chocolate eclair. Between a rock and a very hard place. Two very hard places from the looks of it.
 - All I need is a badly mangled, irate sentence stalking me.
 - When he’d pushed inside me and I’d feel him begin to penetrate, it had turned me into a wild thing-hot, wet, and desperate for more of him. With every kiss, every caress, every thrust, I’d just needed more. He’d touched me, I went nuts. The world dwindled down to one thing: him.
 - She’s my baby girl, Quinn. I want love for her. Real love. The kind that makes a man crazy inside. -Gibraltar to Quinn.
 - When you know who I am. Let me be your man.
 - It’s just that in the Deep South, women learn at a young age that when the world is falling apart around you, it’s time to take down the drapes and make a new dress.
 - I am a kite in a tornado, but I have a long string.
 - I can’t help but see myself in them. The Seelie are who I was before my sister died. Pink, pretty, frivolous Mac. The Unseelie are who I’ve become, carved by loss and despair. Black, grungy, driven Mac.
 - I get off on a man with strong moral fiber. The closest Barrons ever gets to fiber is walking down the cereal aisle at the grocery store.
 - On the lips of my enemy, my sister’s lover, my lover’s killer, I taste the punishment I deserve. I taste oblivion.
 - I was no longer sexually vulnerable to the death-by-sex Fae Prince. Jericho Barrons was my poison now.
 - Please tell me we don’t grow up and turn into the adults that drive us crazy.
 - The wisest man is the silent one. Examine his actions. Judge him by them.
 - Life equaled love plus passion squared. Loving and being passionate about what one did was what made life so precious.
 - Women have been repeating the same mistake since time began: falling for a man’s potential. We rarely see it the same way, and even more rarely care to achieve it.
 - Life’s not linear at all. It happens in lighting flashes. So fast you don’t see those lay-you-out cold moments coming at you until you’re Wile E. Coyote, steamrolled flat as a pancake by the Road Runner, victim of your own elaborate schemes.
 - Love can grown among the rocks and thorns of life.
 - Liminal sucks. You can’t grasp it with your hands and shape it. You can’t make midnight come faster, or grow up sooner, or avoid the in-betweens. You can only hang in there, and get through them.
 - Nobody home but She for Whom I Am the World. Can’t go on like this, can’t keep doing it.- Jericho Barrons.
 - Sometimes I worry that there’s not enough room in my brain for both my dreams and reality that I’m a hard drive with limited gigabytes and one day I won’t be able to maintain the firewall between them. I wonder if that’s what senility is.
 - Abruptly, she knew that after this night she was never going to be the same again. Nothing was ever going to be the same. Oh, yes, the man could define himself as the dawning of an epoch if he wanted to. There was, quite simply, before Adam and after Adam.
 - No matter how people try to dispute it, perception is reality. Its what you choose to believe that makes you the person you are.
 - Four: If you try to force yourself into my head, I will force myself into your pants.
 - How could they let me grow up like that – happy and pink and stupid?
 - Life’s a choice: you can live in black and white, or you can live in colour. I’ll take every shade of the rainbow and the gazillion in between!
 - She’s too young. Too innocent. Too human. For what I’m becoming.
 - Hard. Fast. Deep. When I’m done you’ll know you’re mine.
 - Jericho Barrons was my poison now.
 - I see God in a sunrise, not in repetitious ritual.
 - Pretty girls don’t have ugly mouths.
 - You can’t look at someone with your eyes and take their measure. You have to look with the heart.
 - Sheep are always looking for a new shepherd when the terrain gets rocky.
 - Her absence in my life was so painful that it was a presence.
 - Oh, for heaven’s sake, she thought with droll exasperation, this certainly explains a lot. It’s no wonder I haven’t been able to keep my hands off the blasted man since the day I met him. He’s an artifact! A Celtic one at that!
 - I love music because it’s so fecking brilliant. Music is math, and math is the structure of everything and pretty much perfect.
 - Silence isn’t golden, it’s deadly. It’s a vacuum that fills up with ghosts.
 - The sun’s nearly level with the horizon, right behind his head, making this weird halo effect around his face – as if! I’m surprised he doesn’t smell like brimstone. He probably has a red pitchfork and hides horns under his hair.
 - It’s so easy to lie. What’s even worse is how we cling to those lies. We beg for the illusion so we don’t have to face the truth, don’t have to feel alone.
 - Fire isn’t good or bad. It just burns.
 - I know part of what turns me on so hard, makes me so violent with lust, is that he’s dangerous. I fell for the bad guy. I’m crazy about the one who’s trouble. The alpha that doesn’t play well with others and doesn’t take orders from anyone.
 - God Said: Let there be light! I said: Say please.
 - He didn’t just kiss, he claimed ownership. Took her mouth with urgency, as if his life depended on his kissing her.
 - If V’lane were a signpost, it would read Abandon All Personal Will, Ye Who Tread Here.
 - He had a come-and-get-me-baby-I’m-pure-trouble-and-you’re-gonna-love-it kind of attitude.
 - Dishonesty increases disorder exponentially. It’s hard enough to communicate when you’re telling the truth.
 - Using your own time to make someone else’s life better is, like, the nicest thing you can do for anybody.
 - Keep hoping to see the light in her eyes. Even knowing it’ll mean she’s saying good-bye.
 - Holy borrowing bibliophile, let’s book!
 - Lies are horny little buggers, they breed like rabbits and bound around just as insanely and then you have to try to keep track of them.
 - If I entered a tropical beach, would I end up in Nazi Germany with my highly inconvenient black hair?
 - Lust is a thing of the blood. Doesn’t need head or heart.
 - When he kisses me again, the last part of me that could stand myself dies.
 - Jericho Barrons just told me he loves me.
 - The nerve. Threatening you and not being precise about it.
 - When he comes, he makes a noise deep in his throat that is so raw and animal and sexual that I think if he merely looked at me and made that noise, I might explode in an orgasm.
 - All my life, up until that moment, I’d had a warm, protective blanket wrapped around me, knitted of aunts and uncles, purled of first and second and third cousins, knot-tied with grandmas and grandpas and greats. That blanket had just dropped from my shoulders. I felt cold, lost and alone.
 - What the bloody hell are you, Ms. Lane?
 - He was sexual in a way that made women think of deeply repressed fantasies therapists and feminists alike would cringe to hear tell of.
 - If I’m a little girl, then that makes you a serious pervert.
 - I wake up wating you. I fall asleep wanting you. I watch a magnificent sunrise and can think only of sharing it with you. I glimpse a piece of amver and see your eyes. Jillian, I’ve caught a disease, and the fever abates only when I’m near you.
 - Don’t bother trying to guilt me. Ask my other. It doesn’t work.
 - Basque and Celt. Criminals and barbarians. I didn’t think there could be a more primitive pairing of genes.
 - You need me as much as I need you. That makes us equal partners in my book. Well, your book is just wrong.
 - We will K‘Vruck the world.
 - He knows what I’m thinking. Always. We’re connected. The atoms between us ferry messages back and forth.
 - I kept it to remind me that although there is evil, there is sometimes beauty and light. You, Jillian. You were always my light.
 - There are really only two positions one can take toward anything in life: hope or fear. Hope strengthens, fear kills.
 - And you can tell Darroc that Ms. Lane is mine. If he wants her, he can bloody well come and get her.
 - I didn’t hear him behind me. I felt him. Electric. Wild. One foot in the swamp. Never going to crawl all the way out. And I wanted to have sex with whatever he was. Where was I supposed to put that in my head?
 - She glanced rapidly between them, blinking and hoping her double vision would go away. They were glaring at each other. Would they fight? If she saw her own double she probably be tempted to punch it once or twice. Especially today. For being so stupid.
 - The four Keltar Druids brought their wives and children. They breed like it’s their personal mission to populate their country in case somebody attacks again, as if anybody wants the bloody place.
 - Moth to a flame I follow.
 - Being nearly naked around Barrons felt a lot like going to a shark convention lightly basted in blood.
 - Gazelles didn’t lie down with lions, at least not unbloodied and alive.
 - A little blood never bothers me.
 - Even now, my back was still arched with sensual invitation, my bottom was questing up like a cat in heat, and my every move was supple, sinuous. I was one great big come-hither.
 - We’re taking back the night.
 - I make a new discovery that totally blows; dying is the easy part. It’s coming back to life that sucks.
 - His heavy-lidded gaze reflected a languor that had nothing to do with having just awakened, and there was no doubt what was on his mind. But this is no safe cherry picker, Gwen thought, growing more concerned by the moment. This man looks like a cherry tree chopper-downer.
 - Barrons was powerful, broodingly good-looking, insanely wealthy, frighteningly intelligent, and had exquisite taste, not to mention a hard body that emitted some kind of constant low-level charge. Bottom line: He was the stuff of heroes. And psychotic killers.
 - Pretty girl and all. Asking. Gotta love that. Stuff of heroes. Don’t get the role too often.
 - Nuns? They’d take one look at Barrons and decide the devil himself had come knockng. He not only looked dangerous, he emanated something that made even me feel like crossing myself sometimes, and I’m not religious.
 - He’d made her feel what Barrons made me feel. Bigger than I could possibly be, larger than life, on fire with possibilities, ecstatic to be breathing, impatient for the next moment together. She’d been happy in those last months, so alive and happy.
 - You, Ms. Lane, are a menace to others! A walking, talking catastrophe in pink!
 - My world we humans we’re just pawns on an immortal chessboard.
 - He wasn’t just masculine and sexual, he was carnal in a set-your-teeth-on-edge kind of way; he was almost frightning.
 - I have a black sense of humor. You try living my life, see what color yours turns.
 - He is my vulnerability.
 - I’d teach them to read and to dream and to look at the stars and wonder. I’d teach them the value of imagination. I’d teach them to play every bit as hard as they worked. And I’d teach them that all the brains in the world can’t compensate for love.
 - If he’d been any other man and i’d been any other girl, I’d have called the narrowing of his heavy-lidded dark eyes lust. But he was Barrons and I was Mac, and a blossoming of lust was about as likely as orchids blooming in Antarctica.
 - He lives. I breathe. I want. Him. Always. Fire to my ice. Ice to my fever. -Mac.
 - I hope when I’m ninety-five the only things I want are free: love, family, a good home-cooked meal.
 - Safety is a fence, and fences are for sheep.
 - Kid, you might just annoy me into killing you.
 - Those who were so long imprisoned in ice and darkness seem to find the sunlight jarring, painful. The longer I walk around with this grief inside me, the more I understand that. It’s as if sunshine is a slap in the face that says, Look, the world’s all bright and shiny! Too bad you’re not.
 - One day you do meet a man who kisses you and you can’t breathe around it and you realize you don’t need air.
 - There should be a vaccine against Adam Black. And all women should be given it at birth.
 - The power of thought is far greater than most people ever realize.
 - But he didn’t need to seek visual confirmation of what he’d just heard to know she had. And the truth was, he couldn’t blame her. He’d not have let her die, either. He’d have moved mountains. He’d have battled God or Devil for his wife’s life. She’d betrayed him. He smiled faintly.
 - If he were any other man, I might have suspected him of substance abuse, of being coked up or something. But Barrons was too much a purist for that; his drugs were money, power, and control.
 - You want to believe in black and white, good and evil, heroes that are truly heroic, villains that are just plain bad, but I’ve learned in the past year that things are rarely so simple. The good guys can do some truly awful things, and the bad guys can sometimes surprise the heck out of you.
 - Keeping vigil over her are two monsters of very different breeds but monster just the same. Death on her left. Devil on her right.
 - Werewolves? Oh please, just plain stupid. Who wants to get it on with a man ruled by his inner dog?
 - Revenge. They took too much. You give up and die, or learn how to take back.
 - He’s trying not to laugh. I tell him I would have doomed mankind for him, and he’s trying not to laugh.
 - Last night you said you wanted to know what to expect so you could better select your attire. I told you we were going to visit a vampire in a Goth-den tonight. Why, then, Ms. Lane, do you look like a perky rainbow?
 - When Barrons looks at me like that, it rattles me. Lust, in those ancient, obsidian eyes, offers no trace of humanity. Doesn’t even bother trying. Savage Mac wants to invite it to come out and play. I think she’s nuts. Nuts, I tell you.
 - I think dating courtesies are common courtesies that should be practiced in most all civilized encounters. I pine for the days of good, old-fashioned manners.
 - Do your thing, Ms. Lane. you might be criminally young, but the night is not.
 - I would wear pink because I knew my future was anything but rosy. I would accessorize myself to the hilt, and I would wear flirty shoes because my world needed more beauty to counter all the ugliness in it. I would wear pink because I hated gray, I didn’t deserve white, and I was sick of black.
 - Could words and symbols wield such power? Could mere scribblings on parchment unmake a person’s moral fiber? Weren’t we made of sterner stuff?
 - As I moved deeper into the room, his gaze dropped to my feet, and worked its way back to my face. I was wearing faded jeans, boots, and a snug pink Juicy T-shirt I got on sale at TJ Maxx last summer that said I’m a Juicy girl. “I bet you are,” he murmured.
 - When Drustan reached the bottom step, she flung herself into his arms. He swung her up into his embrace and kissed her hungrily. By the time he’d finished, she was gasping for air and laughing. “My turn?” Dageus teased.
 - He made a lousy passenger, barking instructions I ignored.
 - I love books, they’re in my blood.
 - Just one time before I turn into the villain of this piece, just one time before I become the fourth and final Unseelie prince, I want to be her Highlander. And her hero.
 - Do you think a woman can give a man everything while still withholding her heart? We are not made that way! – Fiona.
 - Now you know how I justify my addictions – if I can pay less for it than I would at Wal-Mart, I get to have it.
 - She’s thirteen. Time will remedy that.
 - He’d surely been spawned by some cataclysmic event of nature, not born.
 - Barrons had just given me the most carnal, sexually charged hungry look I’d ever seen in my life, and I was pretty sure he didn’t even know he had done it.
 - There are two kinds of people in the world Ms. Lane: those who survive no matter the cost and those who are walking victims.
 - I’d turn and run but I’m anchored by two dudes that could hold the Titanic during a tsunami.
 - Barrons: “He got upset it wouldn’t shut up and tore its head off.” Mac: “The child?” I gasped.
 - I was a twenty-two-year-old single white female alone in a strange country where my sister had been killed.
 - Although it may not seem like it, this isn’t a story about darkness. It’s about light. Kahlil Gibran says Your joy can fill you only as deeply your sorrow has carved you. If you’ve never tasted bitterness, sweet is just another pleasant flavor on your tongue. One day I’m going to hold a lot of joy.
 - I was adrift in a sea of questions and if answers were lifeboats, I was in imminent danger of drowning.
 - Omnipotent not omniscient. We are frequently blinded by how much we see.
 - I was stunned to see that he looked stunned himself, which was an exorbitant display of emotion for Barrons.
 - This isn’t what I wanted. This isn’t what I would have chosen. You must know that. It’s important you know that.
 - His face was in my neck and he was breathing hard. Was he grieving me? Already? Would he miss me? Had I, in some tiny way, come to matter to this enigmatic, hard, brilliant, obsessed man? I realised he’d come to matter to me. Good or evil, right or wrong, he mattered to me...
 - For what other reason would you have me save you? Because I like you? Better to be useful than liked.
 - He stepped into the morning feeling more alive than he’d felt in months. Hold fast and believe in me, love, he whispered across the centuries. Because love and belief were serious magic in and of themselves.
 - Is anyone who’s supposed to be dead actually dead?
 - Holy water at my wrists and behind my ears; my version of Eau de Don’tbiteme.
 - Walk out of this with your parents, the stones, and Darroc dead, Ms. Lane, and I‘ll give you the bloody thing.
 - You’re Mac, and I’m Jericho. And nothing else matters.
 - It’s a sponge and I’m a sponge and for a second there all our sponge parts are one and I don’t just have square pants, everything about me is squarish because I’m part of a wall.
 - How dare the embodiment of her worst nightmare come packaged as her hottest fantasy?
 - All those ‘bloodys’ was a veritable cornucopia of emotion for Barrons.
 - He just didn’t look like the kind of creep that would messily murder a woman in her hotel room; he looked like the kind of creep that could line her up in the sights of an assassins rifle without a shred of emotion.
 - He was on me before my brain processed the fact that he was coming for me.
 - A woman who’s lived in a cage all her life. And hates it. Bored in there, aren’t you. Waiting for life to happen. And when it finally does, it steals from you what you loved most. So take back. Explode. Lash out. Blow up.
 - Yesterday was a memory. Today was a hope.
 - I don’t make sonic booms. I want a whip. I like the idea of walking around making sonic booms everywhere.
 - Sighing dismally, she acknowledged that some things just weren’t humanly possible – not even Martha Stewart could fold fitted sheets.
 - I hope they change my drugs soon. Whatever I’m on isn’t working.
 - The single greatest advantage anyone can take into any battle is hope.
 - I’ve spent enough time behind a bar that I’ve formed a few opinions about what people wear and what it says about them. Guys who wear black from head to toe fall into two categories: they want to be trouble, or they are trouble.
 - Barrons, Jericho: I haven’t the faintest fecking clue. He keeps saving my life. I suppose that’s something.
 - Yesterday is skin on snake, to be shed many times.
 - I’d vowed years ago to go to the grave the same way I’d been born, just a lot more wrinkly.
 - Yes, I have loved, Ms. Lane, and although it’s none of your business, I have lost. Many things.
 - They loved so intensely that moments of their life have been etched into the very fabric of the mansion. Some say the king designed it that way, so if one day he lost her he could come live with her residue.
 - Think you two puny Druids can hold this keep for a single night?
 - His coworker was velvety-skinned, a sexy boy-on-the-cusp-of man.
 - He was still frowning at the cake, looking at it as if he expected it to sprout dozens of legs and begin scuttling toward him, thin-lipped, teeth bared.
 - There aren’t many sins in my bible. Giving up is the greatest one of all.
 - You are what you are. Deal with it or change.
 - If you’re trying to force the story to be a straight up romance, it’s going to be weird for you.
 - One of the primary tenets of the course was that highly successful leaders kept journals, morning and night, in order to stay tightly focused on their goals.
 - Gwen Cassidy needed a man. Desperately. Failing that, she’d settle for a cigarette.
 - The two of you are getting downright chatty, aren’t you, Ms. Lane? When did you last see him? what else did he tell you? I’m asking the questions tonight. If an illusion of control comforts you, Ms. Lane, by all means, cling to it.
 - I have studied humans for a small eternity. Intent infuses their every movement. Road maps to their inner navigation, plastered all over their skin. Born to be slaves.
 - He is in my soul and i am in his, and we are in bed but we are in a desert, and i do not know where he begins and i end – Mac.
 - It’s not my fault who I am. The only think that’s my fault is what I choose to do.
 - My breathing was shallow and my hands were fists. ‘Oh, yes, I’m going to have to kill you Barrons.’ I said coolly, Partly because, for the most miniscule sliver of an instant, while looking at those handcuffs, I’d imagined myself climbing back into bed and pretending I wasn’t cured yet.
 - Born in a generation that thinks cynical and disenchanted is cool, sometimes I’m a little off the beaten track.
 - I have found there to be little distance between the unlatching of a chain and the spreading of a woman’s legs. As if they can never unbar only a single entrance. It’s a disease called hope. Women suffer from it greatly.
 - No way. I’m not going in there. I draw the line at grave-robbing, Barrons. It’s not your pen.
 - We were watching Barrons. Why were you watching Barrons? Barrons needs watching.
 - Try a rocket launcher. Think maybe you could manage to hit me with that?
 - You exist in a place that is beyond all rules for me. Do you understand that? – JZB.
