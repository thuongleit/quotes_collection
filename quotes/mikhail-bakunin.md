 - A Boss in Heaven is the best excuse for a boss on earth, therefore If God did exist, he would have to be abolished.
 - But here steps in Satan, the eternal rebel, the first freethinker and the emancipator of worlds. He makes man ashamed of his bestial ignorance and obedience; he emancipates him, stamps upon his brow the seal of liberty and humanity, in urging him to disobey and eat of the fruit of knowledge.
