 - Ever since we achieved a breakthrough in the area of recombinant DNA in 1973, left-wing nuts and environmental kooks have been screaming that we will create some kind of Frankenstein bug or Andromeda Strain that will destroy us all.
 - Today, the theory of evolution is an accepted fact for everyone but a fundamentalist minority, whose objections are based not on reasoning but on doctrinaire adherence to religious principles.
 - Our goal should be to understand our differences.
 - I turned against the left wing because they don’t like genetics, because genetics implies that sometimes in life we fail because we have bad genes. They want all failure in life to be due to the evil system.
 - There is no firm reason to anticipate that the intellectual capacities of peoples geographically separated in their evolution should prove to have evolved identically. Our wanting to reserve equal powers of reason as some universal heritage of humanity will not be enough to make it so.

 - Science moves with the spirit of an adventure characterized both by youthful arrogance and by the belief that the truth, once found, would be simple as well as pretty.
 - The biggest advantage to believing in God is you don’t have to understand anything, no physics, no biology. I wanted to understand.
 - Science has always been my preoccupation and when you think a breakthrough is possible, it is terribly exciting.
 - A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.
 - If I had been married earlier in life, I wouldn’t have seen the double helix. I would have been taking care of the kids on Saturday. On the other hand, I was lonely a lot of the time.

 - The pace of discovery is going unbelievably fast.
 - I am thrilled to see my genome.
 - Science that leads over the horizon depends on gathering the best minds and enabling them to do what the best minds naturally seek to do: pursue the most thrilling questions of the time.
 - A clone of Einstein wouldn’t be stupid, but he wouldn’t necessarily be any genius, either.
 - Do things as soon as you can. If a decision needs to be made, make it. It gives you more time to change your mind.
 - Some think there is something wrong about enhancing people.
 - No good model ever accounted for all the facts, since some data was bound to be misleading if not plain wrong.
 - I think the reason people are dealing with science less well now than 50 years ago is that it has become so complicated.
 - There are many people of color who are very talented.

 - I wish there would be more movies about scientists.
 - If you succeed with your first dream, it helps. You know, people trust you, possibly, for the second one. They give you a chance to play out your second one.
 - My heroes were never scientists. They were Graham Greene and Christopher Isherwood, you know, good writers.
 - Ultimately, we’ll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog.
 - The way to do great science is to stay away from subjects that are overpopulated, and go to the frontiers.
 - Polls consistently show that the majority of Americans favour research using embryonic stem cells and yet politicians continue to pander to the outspoken religious minority that is hampering efforts to develop this potentially valuable technology.
 - As an educator, I have always striven to see that the fruits of the American Dream are available to all.
 - Racists have often used pseudoscience to justify their socially damaging views; watch these films to see how science, by replacing ignorance with knowledge, can undo that damage.
