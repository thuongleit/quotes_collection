 - The Lord hereby would make us the more acknowledge His hand, and to see that our help is always in Him.
 - The portion of some is to have their afflictions by drops, now one drop and then another; but the dregs of the cup, the wine of astonishment, like a sweeping rain that leaveth no food, did the Lord prepare to be my portion.
 - Before I knew what affliction meant, I was ready sometimes to wish for it.
 - It is good for me that I have been afflicted.
