 - Routine kills creative thought.
 - I hate stereotypes and I hate cliche.
 - It’s not even a question of whether the universe is meaningful or meaningless. It’s in what way could it be meaningful, or in what way, if it was meaningful, could that be even more meaningless than normal meaninglessness?
 - In real life nothing means anything. Stuff happens and there just is no structure.
 - For other people, love is like some rare orchid that can only grow in one place under a certain set of conditions. For me it’s like bindweed. It grows with no encouragement at all, under any conditions, and just strangles everything else.

 - What folly takes light through ether to each eye from every horizon.
 - The sky was the colour of sad weddings.
 - In some ways I’m a frustrated scientist or mathematician. The amount of times I’ve thought I’d go back to university and do theoretical physics because I like the big questions, but really I know now that that’s not quite me. What’s me is to do it in novels.
