 - The night has a thousand eyes, And the day but one; Yet the light of the bright world dies, With the dying sun. The mind has a thousand eyes, And the heart but one; Yet the light of a whole life dies, When love is done.
 - The light of a whole life dies When love is gone.
 - The mind has a thousand eyes.
