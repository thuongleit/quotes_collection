 - Theatre is a mirror, a sharp reflection of society. The greatest playwrights are moralists.
 - If I’m who I am because I’m who I am and you’re who you are because you are who you are, then I’m who I am and you’re who you are. If, on the other hand, I’m who I am because you’re who you are, and if you’re who you are because I’m who I am, then I’m not who I am and you’re not who you are.
 - Courtesy is a waste of time; it weakens you and undermines you.
 - What we like about women is sensuality, wildness, hormones. Women who make a song and dance about their intuition.
 - After I write, I have nothing to say. The commentary afterwards is superfluous. I write. And that’s enough.
 - Women always think you need a man, you need a father, as if they’d be the slightest use. Men are a dead weight, they’re clumsy and maladjusted.
