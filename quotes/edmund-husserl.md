 - All perception is a gamble.
 - To begin with, we put the proposition: pure phenomenology is the science of pure consciousness.
 - I must achieve internal consistency.
 - Experience by itself is not science.
 - All consciousness is consciousness of something.
 - The ideal of a pure phenomenology will be perfected only by answering this question; pure phenomenology is to be separated sharply from psychology at large and, specifically, from the descriptive psychology of the phenomena of consciousness.
