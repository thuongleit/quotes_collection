 - Empathy is the most radical of human emotions.
 - Law and justice are not always the same.
 - The first problem for all of us, men and women, is not to learn, but to unlearn.
 - Feminism has never been about getting a job for one woman. It’s about making life more fair for women everywhere. It’s not about a piece of the existing pie; there are too many of us for that. It’s about baking a new pie.
 - The first resistance to social change is to say it’s not necessary.
 - You are the leader you’ve been waiting for.
 - Most writers write to say something about other people – and it doesn’t last. Good writers write to find out about themselves – and it lasts forever.
 - But somewhere within each of us, buried at varying depths depending on the age and degree of neglect or abuse, shame or coercion we endured, there is a resistant, daydreaming, rebellious, creative, unique child – a true self who is waiting.
 - Oppression has no logic – just a self-fulfilling prophecy, justified by a self-perpetuating system.
 - If the shoe doesn’t fit, must we change the foot?
 - Law and justice are not always the same. When they aren’t, destroying the law may be the first step toward changing it.

 - Inner space is the real frontier.
 - Nothing will happen automatically. Change depends on what you and I do every day.
 - Work is valued by the social value of the worker.
 - Feminism is about friends and sisters and community.

 - Some of us are becoming the men we wanted to marry.
 - The art of life is not controlling what happens to us, but using what happens to us.

 - If what’s inside your dreams wasn’t already real inside you, you couldn’t even dream it.
 - Power in this country is often like hemophilia; it passes through women and then men get it.
 - No, I’ll take responsibility for my own life, I am going to make a decision. And you know, to this day, I would raise flags on all public buildings to celebrate the chance I had to make that decision.
 - Power can be taken, but not given. The process of the taking is empowerment in itself.

 - Intelligence in the service of poor instinct is really dangerous.
 - Logic is in the eye of the logician.
 - Girls are taught to view their bodies as unending projects to work on, whereas boys from a young age, are taught to view their bodies as tools to master their environment.
 - To me, the model of success is not linear. Success is completing the full circle of yourself.
 - If you really want to be lonely, get married.
 - Being married is like having somebody permanently in your corner. It feels limitless, not limited.
 - I have yet to hear a man ask for advice on how to combine marriage and a career.
 - Only when women rebel against patriarchal standards does female muscle become more accepted.
 - The uncomfortable truth seems to be that the amount of talk by women has been measured less against the amount of men’s talk than against the expectation of female silence.
 - There’s no greater gift than thinking that you had some impact on the world, for the better.
 - God may be in the details, but the goddess is in the questions. Once we begin to ask them, there’s no turning back.
 - Life after 50 or 60 is itself another country, as different as adolescence is from childhood, or as adulthood is from adolescence – and just as adventurous.
 - Gratitude never radicalized anybody. I don’t care if they recognize the past, I just want them to get angry about the present and keep going.
 - I have me brave women who are exploring the outer edge of human possibility, with no history to guide them, and with a courage to make themselves vulnerable that I find moving beyond words.
 - Sexuality has always been for humans a form of communication, a way we express love and caring and bonding, not only a way we have children if we choose to.
 - We need to remember across generations that there is as much to learn as there is to teach.
 - In the late ’60s, people were saying we need power to, not power over. Power to do, accomplish, create, not power over other people.
 - The phenomenon of the woman who’s asked what movie she wants to see, and she says, “I don’t know. What do you want to see?” It’s a tiny version of a big tendency. Women need to say, “This is what I want.”
 - If you love your work, I’m not sure you have hobbies. I try to say no to things that other people could do and only say yes to things that only I could do.
 - There’s no emotion more revolutionary than empathy.
 - Women tend to be conservative in youth and get more radical as they get older because they lose power with age. So, if a young woman is not a feminist, I say, just wait.
 - When unique voices are united in a common cause, they make history.
 - Transformation happens in small groups. Each person can speak and all listen.
 - One act of violence takes four generations to heal.
 - Every social justice movement that I know of has come out of people sitting in small groups, telling their life stories, and discovering that other people have shared similar experiences.
 - Someone once asked me why women don’t gamble as much as men do and I gave the commonsensical reply that we don’t have as much money. That was a true but incomplete answer. In fact, women’s total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage.
 - Battered women is a phrase that uncovered major, long-hidden violence. It helps us to face the fact that, statistically speaking, the most dangerous place for a woman is in her own home, not in the streets.
 - When you attempt something new, there’s always fear. A couple of helpful slogans to me are “follow the fear” or “fear is a sign of growth.”
 - At my age, in this still hierarchical time, people often ask me if I’m “passing the torch.” I explain that I’m keeping my torch, thank you very much-and I’m using it to light the torches of others.

 - When men realize that feminism is a universal good that affects them in very intimate ways then I think they really become allies and leaders.
 - The point is less what we choose than that we have the power to make a choice.
 - We need to unlearn some of our respect for education, since it has undermined our respect for ourselves.

 - It is more rewarding to watch money change the world than watch it accumulate.
 - If women could sleep their way to the top, there’d be a lot more women at the top.
 - All biographers, no matter how sympathetic, end up using their subjects as mirrors to figure themselves out. I don’t want to be anyone’s mirror.
 - One of the main problems of our time is that men are deprived of their human qualities that are wrongly called feminine, and women are deprived of their human qualities that are wrongly called masculine.
 - If you follow the voice inside you, it does give you guidance.
 - We can tell our values by looking at our checkbook stubs.
 - As an activist, you do find yourself directed more toward public action. But I’ve always tried to use stories from my own life in my writing. It has always been clear to me that the stories of each other’s lives are our best textbooks.

 - By the year 2000 we will, I hope, raise our children to believe in human potential, not God.
 - Any woman who chooses to behave like a full human being should be warned that the armies of the status quo will treat her as something of a dirty joke. That’s their natural and first weapon. She will need her sisterhood.
 - The best way for us to cultivate fearlessness in our daughters and other young women is by example.
 - Once we give up searching for approval we often find it easier to earn respect.
 - Though both erotica and pornography refer to verbal or pictorial representations of sexual behavior, they are as different as a room with doors open and one with doors locked. The first might be a home, but the second could only be a prison.
 - The voting booth is the only place that a pauper equals a billionaire, and any woman equals any man.
 - The deepest change begins with men raising children as much as women do and women being equal actors in the world outside the home.

 - Women’s total instinct for gambling is satisfied by marriage.
 - Hope is a very unruly emotion.
 - When you say something in a wrong group – it will never be right, so you can not say anything wrong, when you don’t belong to a group.
 - I can’t mate in captivity.
 - The whole idea is not to figure out what you should do that will matter, but to make each thing you do reflect the values you want, because we don’t know what’s going to matter in the future.
 - Superwoman is the adversary of the women’s movement.
 - Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male-female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master.
 - The purpose of feminism is to free the uniqueness of the individual and to understand that inside each of us is a unique human being who is a combination of heredity and environment.
 - Little girls do not wake up in the morning and say “I dream of being a prostitute.” It is a terrible, terrible life. Body invasion is more traumatic than even getting beaten up. In certain circumstances, obviously, it may be a way to survive.
 - People say, ‘Oh, you’ve sacrificed so much, now’s the time to do something for yourself.’ I mean, please – that is so wrong. I don’t think I’ve sacrificed one f-king thing.
 - For a man to say, “I have to leave work now because I need to do something with my kids,” it’s sometimes viewed as a career killer. He doesn’t have the right drive. So when they depart from their gender roles, they face some of the same restrictions.
 - We’ll only really know we’ve succeeded when a mediocre woman does as well as a mediocre man. You shouldn’t have to be extraordinary. That’s the point!
 - Women are not going to be equal outside the home until men are equal in it.
 - I would say don’t worry about what you should do, do whatever you can. And seek companions with shared values.

 - It’s never to late for a happy childhood.
 - Evil is obvious only in retrospect.
 - We’ll never solve the feminization of power until we solve the masculinity of wealth.
 - I think laughter is crucial. Some of the original cultures, like the Dalit and the Native American, don’t separate laughter and seriousness.

 - A woman reading Playboy feels a little like a Jew reading a Nazi manual.
 - Human beings are communal beings and we can’t exist or prosper by ourselves. We need each other’s support.
 - I think of the future in two ways – survival plus moving forward. Under survival, I would put all the efforts to save the female half of the world from violence directed at us specifically because we are female.
 - Logic has nothing to do with oppression.
 - Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.
 - Having someone who looks like us but thinks like them is worse than having no one at all.
 - Given the expectations of society at large, men are generally correct in their assumption that it is important for a woman to have a man. What they do not understand is how pathetically little difference it makes what man.
 - Nature doesn’t move in a straight line, and as part of nature, neither do we.
 - The point of the journey is not just healing. It’s also recovering the truest, most spontaneous, joyful, and creative core of ourselves.

 - Men may feel just disempowered by intimacy, by being close to a woman, and also by feeling the tender feelings that they’re ashamed of.
 - Most American children suffer too much mother and too little father.
 - Women can be vivacious. We are allowed more varieties of facial expression and gestures. Men must be rocklike.
 - It turns out that we literally don’t empathize unless we’re physically present – that the oxytocin, the famous “tend and befriend” hormone is not produced unless we’re present with all five senses.
 - Feminism starts out being very simple, and it ends up being a world view that questions hierarchy altogether.
 - Homemakers work longer and harder than any other class of worker in the United States for less pay, and are the most likely to be replaced by a younger worker.
 - Women have always been an equal part of the past. We just havent been a part of history.
 - I hope readers will consider, especially in this age of the World Wide Web, that as miraculous as it is, we still need to be in the same room with all five senses if we are to empathize with each other.
 - There is no such thing as a crime of passion, only a crime of possession.
 - You’re a unique person. You should do what you’re suited to do. We all should. It’s the only way to be happy. That pressure is all outside. It’s external.
 - There is no such thing as Superwoman. You cant have everything if you do everything.
 - I don’t want to die saying but, you know? There’s so much I want to do, so I want more time.
 - This is what forty looks like. We’ve been lying so long, who would know?
 - It would be a disaster to have Sarah Palin or Carly Fiorina in the White House, so it’s not just a woman, but a woman who stands for the majority needs of women. It’s not just getting a job for one woman, it’s making life better for all women.
 - I think I’ve wasted some of my time, but used most of it well, and have realized that my life is not separate from other people’s lives or from the universe. I think our moments of happiness really come from a feeling of unity.
 - The old languages – at least the ones I know – don’t have gender. They don’t have gendered pronouns. There’s no “he” and “she.” A human being is a human being.
 - We feel very celebratory and positive that we have created a voyage across the DMZ in peace and reconciliation that was said to be impossible.
 - Most women are one man away from welfare.
 - Violence against women is clearly not solved, not at all solved, and the reasons for it, which are controlling women’s bodies in order to control reproduction, are definitely not solved.
 - Elephants are so wise and so funny and so endangered and so intelligent. I just think there is a lot to learn from them.
 - I think if we could raise one generation of kids without violence and shaming, we don’t know what might be possible.
 - Too much of our lives corresponds to the ‘lost-wallet’ theory of life. You lose something, spend a long time finding it, and then feel grateful to be back where you started.
 - Romance is a means to the end of self-completion, but love is an end in itself.
 - I did not see any way that I could possibly give birth to someone else and also give birth to myself. Far from feeling guilty, it was the first time that I had taken responsibility for my own life.

 - Democracy is mob rule with income taxes.
 - You may very well fall in love with somebody who makes less money, who’s younger than you, who weighs less than you.
 - I do not like to write – I like to have written.
 - Where men come to and women come together most intimately in sexuality in the home has become suffused with violence.

 - At my graduation, I thought we had to marry what we wished to become. Now you are becoming the men you once would have wished to marry.
 - The same big TV antenna dwarfed each roof, as though life here could only be bearable if lived elsewhere in the imagination.
 - The problem is, for men and women, the idea that sexuality is about dominance and submission, when, in fact, cooperation is a lot more fun, to put it my way. So some of it, a lot of it, is just about empathy.
 - Like art, revolutions come from combining what exists into what has never existed before.
 - Most of us are living out the unlived lives of our mothers, because they were not able to become the unique people they were born to be.
 - An education is not a thing one gets, but a lifelong process.
 - Liberation does not come from outside.
 - The belief that women should control our own bodies may be a majority belief, but the minority that believes otherwise is against not only safe and legal abortions but contraception and even sex education.
 - I wouldn’t want to generalize, but we still do live in a society that’s sexist and racist and addicted to class and has the ridiculous idea that if you have money you’re smarter, which Donald Trump by himself should be able to disprove.
 - Self-esteem is the basis of any democracy.
 - I want us to organize, to tell the personal stories that create empathy, which is the most revolutionary emotion.
 - A man can be called ruthless if he bombs a country to oblivion. A woman can be called ruthless if she puts you on hold.
 - Before feminism, work was largely defined as what men did or would do. Thus, a working woman was someone who labored outside the home for money, masculine-style.
 - I never expected to be even busier at 81, and doing more of what I love, than when I was 30.
 - The young women seem to think that they can only go out with or marry a man who is superior to them. The problem there is that they are wanting to be defeated, as opposed to finding a partner.
 - The original languages didn’t even have he and she. They didn’t have concepts of masculine and feminine. People were people. And the whole idea was that we were in a circle together, not in a hierarchy together.
 - When the gender role starts to descend, boys get into the masculine box.
 - You’re afraid to be close to women. Because it’s not masculine to be close to women. The last time you were close to a woman, you were a child.
 - This is the wisdom: If we bless our bodies, they will bless us.
 - Being able to support oneself allows one to choose a marriage out of love and not just economic dependence. It also allows one to risk that marriage.
 - The only thing I can’t stand is discomfort.
 - When the past dies, there is mourning, but when the future dies our imaginations are compelled to carry it on.
 - Knowing About Victoria Woodhull inspires women to be daring, outrageous and creative.
 - A movement happens when people are inspired by somebody, but they do it themselves. You don’t wait for someone else. You do it yourself.
 - We have to stop arresting prostitutes and not arresting traffickers and pimps. It’s absurd. We’re arresting the victim or the survivor and not the oppressor.
 - In order to make a choice, you need the power to see there is one.
 - The definition of woman’s work is shitwork.
 - Writers are notorious for using any reason to keep from working: over-researching, retyping, going to meetings, waxing the floors – anything.
 - We’re communal animals. If we’re by ourselves, we can feel wrong and crazy and out of step with society. We really need those talking circles.

 - The ends and means are a seamless web.
 - Feminism isn’t called the longest revolution for nothing.
 - There is a naive belief that injustice only had to be pointed out in order to be cured.
 - I think we all have the power to name ourselves. I try to call people what it is they wish to be called. But we can take the sting out of epithets and bad words by using them.
 - The origins of violence against women by men are not biological. If that were the case, it would exist in every culture. And it doesn’t exist in every culture.
 - Women get hit with a double whammy. If they’re attractive, they’re presumed to have slept their way to the top. If they’re unattractive, they are presumed to have chosen a profession because they could not get a man.
 - I don’t know if fury can compete with necessity as the mother of invention, but I recommend it.
 - If you can learn to like how you look, and not the way you think you look, it can set you free.
 - A portable friend to all readers-especia lly but not only women-who need to learn that the Golden Rule works only if it’s reversible: We must learn to treat ourselves as well as we wish to treat others.
 - Labeling makes the invisible visible, but it’s limiting. Categories are the enemy of connecting. Link, don’t rank.
 - Anybody who has ever met a baby knows there is already a person in there.
 - Most art in the world does not have a capital ‘A,’ but is a way of turning everyday objects into personal expressions.
 - No matter how hard I worked, whatever I accomplished was attributed to my looks. If you’re working your ass off, then you don’t want to be told that you only got whatever because of the way you look. It takes the heart out of you.
 - It’s endlessly interesting to be organizing and hearing possible solutions or thinking of possible solutions and how to put efforts together. It makes everything else boring, actually.
 - Economics anxiety may be even more common than the often identified ‘math anxiety,’ for unlike math, which has its personal uses, economics is seen as a mysterious set of forces manipulated from above.
 - Each individual woman’s body demands to be accepted on its own terms.
 - A movement is only composed of people moving. To feel its warmth and motion around us is the end as well as the means.
 - The dogma is that that dogma is a mistake.
 - Unless we include a job as part of every citizen’s right to autonomy and personal fulfillment, women will continue to be vulnerable to someone else’s idea of what need is.

 - We have to imagine change before we can begin to move toward it.
 - Most women’s magazines simply try to mold women into bigger and better consumers.
 - I just think that culturally, women – we’re all human beings – but at least we don’t have our masculinity to prove.
 - I know that lack of contact creates more lack of contact, and contact creates more contact, or at least an ability to talk to with each other.
 - Society certainly encourages women to be victims in every way. I mean if we want approval, we have to sing the blues, even as singers we sing the blues.
 - Proust’s tea cake has nothing on one hour in a college dorm.
 - If you look at the public opinion polls even, support for all the issues, people who self-identify as feminists are as least as many as those who self-identify as Republicans.
 - I would put all the efforts to humanize the “masculine” and “feminine” gender roles that are the beginning of a false human hierarchy and normalize race, class and other systems of domination to come.
 - It’s an incredible con job when you think about it, to believe something now in exchange for something after death. Even corporations with their reward systems don’t try to make it posthumous.
 - From pacifist to terrorist, each person condemns violence – and then adds one cherished case in which it may be justified.
 - I always thought that “humanist” was a good word long before I understood that anyone thought it was a bad word.

 - Don’t worry about your background, whether it’s odd or ordinary, use it, build on it.
 - A person who has experienced something is almost always far more expert on it than are the experts.
 - Women fear endangering men’s approval so much, we don’t even wait for them to say no. Or else we protect them, even if it means saying no to ourselves.
 - People start to talk about post-racist, post-feminist. What does that mean? We’re clearly not post either. Would you say post-democracy? Clearly we haven’t reached true democracy yet.
 - I would say that reproductive freedom comes first, then violence and economics.
 - If men started taking care of children, the job will become more valuable.
 - Self-esteem starts out as a personal blessing, but it becomes nothing less than an evolutionary force.
 - The Internet is an almost miraculous way of getting information, of finding and organizing with each other, both minutely and globally. A million times better than the phone and the mimeograph! Also much better than TV, which is one-way and passive.
 - Show me something that is not transformed by the other half of the human race.
 - If men menstruated, they would brag about how much and for how long.
 - We have to learn to stand up for our interests. To seek purity is self-defeating and a stereotype in itself: women have to be pure, women are not concerned about money.
 - In retrospect, perhaps the biggest reason my mother was cared for but not helped for twenty years was the simplest: Her functioning was not that necessary to the world.
 - You can hardly open a newspaper without seeing that a woman has been killed by a man for clearly gender-related reasons.
 - A rejection of the way a woman speaks is often a way of blaming or dismissing her without dealing with the content of what she is saying.
 - Anyone who has ever experienced dehumanized life on welfare or any other confidence-shaking dependency knows that a paid job may be preferable to the dole, even when the handout is coming from a family member.
 - We need to take violence against women seriously. It is the biggest indicator of whether a country is violent inside itself, and whether it will be militarily violent against another country.
 - Karla Jay’s intimate account of life in the early years of feminism and gay liberation is as irresistible as a novel, but as credible, humorous, and unexpected as real life.
 - The most impersonal seeming audiences eventually just say such intimate, smart, wise, amazing, totally surprising, funny things. It’s empowering, in the sense of feeling like you’re a part of something really important.
 - In every century, there are a handful of writers who help the human race to evolve. Andrea is one of them.
 - I will no longer be referred to as Miss Steinem of Ms. magazine.
 - Writing is always harder than talking.
 - They would say well there’s always been wars, men have always beaten women. But it isn’t true in all cultures. It doesn’t have to be true. And the first step is imaging.
 - Childbirth is more admirable than conquest, more amazing than self-defense, and as courageous as either one.
 - We will live to see the day that St. Patrick’s Cathedral is a child-care center and the pope is no longer a disgrace to the skirt that he has on.
 - Happy or unhappy, families are all mysterious. We have only to imagine how differently we would be described – and will be, after our deaths – by each of the family members who believe they know us.
 - Worry less about solutions from the top or the idea that there is a solution, but try to do whatever you can and instill in each action the values that you want to result.
 - I always trust the microcosm over the macrocosm.
 - Like so many women, I was living out the unlived life of my mother, so I wouldn’t be her. But the price I paid was that I distanced myself internally. I wasn’t as close to her then as I nowadays, in retrospect, wish I had been.
