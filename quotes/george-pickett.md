 - We’ll make a bunker hill of it.
 - Up men to your posts! Don’t forget today that you are from old Virginia.
 - General Lee, I have no division.
 - I always thought the Yankees had something to do with it.
 - Well, it is all over now. The battle is lost, and many of us are prisoners, many are dead, many wounded, bleeding and dying. Your Soldier lives and mourns and but for you, my darling, he would rather, a million times rather, be back there with his dead, to sleep for all time in an unknown grave.
