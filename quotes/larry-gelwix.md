 - If you lose your integrity, you’ve lost everything.
 - I want you to be forever strong on the field, so that you will be forever strong off the field.
 - It’s not about rugby, it’s about young men. It’s not about building a championship team, it’s about building championship boys. Boys who will be forever strong.
 - Don’t spend another minute being angry about yesterday, free him, and you free yourself.
 - I don’t build championship teams, I build championship boys.
