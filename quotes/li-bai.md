 - The birds have vanished into the sky, and now the last cloud drains away. We sit together, the mountain and me, until only the mountain remains.
 - Since Life is but a Dream, Why toil to no avail?
 - The living is a passing traveler; The dead, a man come home.
 - I am asked why I live in the green mountains; I smile but reply not, for my heart is at rest. The flowing waters carry the image of the peach blossoms far, far away; there is an earth, there is a heaven, unknown to men.
 - Heaven is high, Earth Wide. Bitter between them flies my sorrow.
 - The world is like a great empty dream. Why should one toil away one’s life?
 - Beneath the blossoms with a pot of wine, No friends at hand, so I poured alone; I raised my cup to invite the moon, Turned to my shadow, and we became three.
 - To find pleasure in life, make the most of the spring.
 - All the birds have flown up and gone; A lonely cloud floats leisurely by. We never tire of looking at each other – Only the mountain and I.
 - You ask me why I dwell in the green mountain; I smile and make no reply for my heart is free of care. As the peach-blossom flows down stream and is gone into the unknown, I have a world apart that is not among men.
 - Growing older, I love only quietness: who need be concerned with the things of this world? Looking back, what better plan than this: returning to the grove.
 - I bow in reverence to the white cloud.
 - Forever and forever and forever.
 - Shade and light are different in every valley.
 - Now let you and me buy wine today! Why say we have not the price? My horse spotted with five flowers, My fur-coat worth a thousand pieces of gold, These I will take out, and call my boy To barter them for sweet wine. And with you twain, let me forget The sorrow of ten thousand ages!
 - From the walls of Baidi high in the coloured dawn To Jiangling by night-fall is three hundred miles, Yet monkeys are still calling on both banks behind me To my boat these ten thousand mountains away.
 - The paired butterflies are already yellow with August Over the grass in the West garden; They hurt me. I grow older.
 - Bears, dragons, tempestuous on mountain and river, Startle the forest and make the heights tremble. Clouds darken beneath the darkness of rain, streams pale with a pallor of mist. The gods of Thunder and Lightning Shatter the whole range.
