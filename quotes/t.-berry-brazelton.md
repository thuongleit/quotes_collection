 - Every time you give a parent a sense of success or of empowerment, you’re offering it to the baby indirectly. Because every time a parent looks at that baby and says ‘Oh, you’re so wonderful,’ that baby just bursts with feeling good about themselves.

 - A grandchild is a miracle, but a renewed relationship with your own children is even a greater one.
