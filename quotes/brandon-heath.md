 - Give me Your eyes for just one second, Give me Your eyes so I can see, Everything that I keep missing, Give me Your love for humanity, Give me Your arms for the broken-hearted, The ones that are far beyond my reach, Give me Your heart for the ones forgotten, Give me Your eyes so I can see.
 - You’re the hope in the morning, you’re the light when the night is falling, you’re the song when my heart is singing, it’s your love!
 - Sometimes we need to open our eyes wide and intentionally look for Jesus, in the midst of our own worlds.
 - You know we don’t have to wait until the end of the night, just to say that something’s wrong and maybe nobody’s right. We’re all victims in a battle, that we never had to fight. It’s okay. It’s alright. Steady now, we’re in this thing together.
