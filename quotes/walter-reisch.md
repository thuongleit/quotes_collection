 - The ultimate aim of all science is to penetrate the unknown.
 - I don’t sleep. I hate those little slices of death.
 - A scientist who cannot prove what he has accomplished, has accomplished nothing.
 - There’s no term to the work of a scientist.
 - This I know; the spirit of Man cannot be stopped.
