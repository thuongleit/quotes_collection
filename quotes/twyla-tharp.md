 - Before you can think out of the box, you have to start with a box.
 - Art is the only way to run away without leaving home.
 - Generosity is luck going in the opposite direction, away from you. If you’re generous to someone, if you do something to help him out, you are in effect making him lucky. This is important. It’s like inviting yourself into a community of good fortune.
 - Our ability to grow is directly proportional to an ability to entertain the uncomfortable.
 - Creativity is a habit, and the best creativity is a result of good work habits.
 - Whom the gods wish to destroy, they give unlimited resources.
 - To embrace luck, you have to enhance your tolerance for ambiguity.
 - You may wonder which came first: the skill or the hard work. But that’s a moot point. The Zen master cleans his own studio. So should you.
 - The blank space can be humbling. But I’ve faced it my whole professional life. It’s my job. It’s also my calling. Bottom line: Filling this empty space constitutes my identity.
 - I don’t think that scheduling is uncreative. I think that structure is required for creativity.
 - I began to discriminate between fear and excitement. The two, though very close, are completely different. Fear is negative excitement, choking your imagination. Real excitement produces an energy that overcomes apprehension and makes you want to close in on your goal.
 - Ultimately there is no such thing as failure. There are lessons learned in different ways.
 - You double your intensity with skill.
 - When creativity has become your habit; when you’ve learned to manage time, resources, expectations, and the demands of others; when you understand the value and place of validation, continuity, and purity of purpose, then you’re on the way to an artist’s ultimate goal; the achievement of mastery.
 - When you’re in a rut, you have to question everything except your ability to get out of it.
 - Concentrate: you can’t have it all.
 - Metaphor is the lifeblood of all art.
 - The more you know, the better you can imagine.
 - There are as many forms of memory as there are ways of perceiving, and every one of them is worth mining for inspiration.

 - I had always seen myself as a star; I wanted to be a galaxy.
 - You don’t get into the mood to create – it’s discipline.
 - The first steps of a creative act are like groping in the dark: random and chaotic, feverish and fearful, a lot of busy-ness with no apparent or definable end in sight.
 - Without the little ideas, there are no big ideas.
 - I don’t think politicians should be allowed into power who are not familiar with their bodies, because that’s where our bottom line is. And I know that they would make totally different decisions if they felt responsible simply for their own bodies.
 - Optimism with some experience behind it is much more energizing than plain old experience with a certain degree of cynicism.
 - Alone is a fact, a condition where no one else is around. Lonely is how you feel about that.
 - Failing, and learning from it, is necessary. Unil you’ve done it, you’re missing an important piece of your creative arsenal.
 - In the future, I will make certain that I commit to projects so there’s enough breathing space for me to have an emotional life.
 - If you’re speaking of love, you really must include the element of uncertainty – and perhaps it’s best approached as the art of constant maintenance.
 - Dancing is like bank robbery, it takes split-second timing.
 - My mother was the first woman in the county in Indiana where we were born, in Jay County, to have a college degree. She was educated as a pianist and she wanted to concertize, but when the war came she was married, had a family, so she started teaching.
 - You have to believe there’s something at the other side. And you have to have faith in yourself. You have to think that you have the tools to accomplish it.
 - Skill is how you close the gap between what you can see in your mind’s eye and what you can produce; the more skill you have, the more sophisticated and accomplished your ideas can be. With absolute skill comes absolute confidence.
 - Everyone has a talent. It’s simply a question of good discipline, of the good fortune to have an education that meshes with that talent, and a lot of luck.
 - You’re only kidding yourself if you put creativity before craft.
 - The ballet needs to tell its own story in such a way it can be received without having to be translated into language.
 - The content and thematic materials of dance is, of itself, like boxing. You play tennis and baseball. But boxing is not a sport you play: you stand up and do it.
 - Just when you arrive at the apex of your skills, it’s time to retire. But as it turned out, I decided that since it was the thing that I felt I did best, I owed it to all that be to pursue it.
 - I started formal piano training when I was 4. From there I had little violas, and I had dancing lessons of every sort and description, and painting lessons. I had German. And shorthand.
 - Solitude is an unavoidable part of creativity. Self-reliance is a happy by-product.
 - As people who have commitments and obligations, we try to blockade emotions and go on our course towards excellence, and that’s a lie. I’ve definitely paid a price. Everything is an exchange.
 - Creativity is not just for artists. It’s for businesspeople looking for a new way to close a sale; it’s for engineers trying to solve a problem; it’s for parents who want their children to see the world in more than one way.
 - Once you accept the power of spine in the creative act, you will become much more efficient in your creativity. You will still get lost on occasion, but having a spine will anchor you.
 - A dancer’s life is all about repetition.
 - I walk into a large white room. It’s a dance studio in midtown Manhattan. The room is clean, virtually spotless if you don’t count the thousands of skid marks and footprints left there by dancers rehearsing. Other than the mirrors, the boom box, the skid marks, and me, the room is empty.
 - The notion of the hero as outsider, as alien, is forget it, over, done with. It’s not about being against society anymore. It’s about standing there, holding something up. It’s not pulling away.
 - I work because I have issues and questions and feelings and thoughts that I want to have a look at. I’m not in need of, or wanting, particularly, to know what other folk are up to.
 - Whether it’s a painter finding his way each morning to the easel, or a medical researcher returning daily to the laboratory, the routine is as much a part of the creative process as the lightning bolt of inspiration, maybe more.
 - My greatest fear in working is always the end. Lately I have taken to tricking myself into finishing by leaving a hole in the middle somewhere, then stitching the two pieces together – the Union Pacific approach.
 - I read for growth, firmly believing that what you are today and what you will be in five years depends on two things: the people you meet and the books you read.
 - Any comic is a tragic soul. Comedy is one of the things that allows one to survive. Particularly if one has been in the process of separating off the emotions, it’s one place you can process them.
 - More often than not I’ve found, a rut is a consequence of sticking to tried and tested methods that don’t take into account how you or the world has changed.
 - I’ve survived inattention. I hope to God I survive attention.
 - The only thing I fear more than change is no change. The business of being static makes me nuts.
 - Everything is raw material. Everything is relevant. Everything is usable. Everything feeds into my creativity. But without proper preparation, I cannot see it, retain it, and use it.
 - Obligation is a flimsy base for creativity, way down the list behind passion, courage, instinct, and the desire to do something great.
 - I have learned over the years that you should never save for two meetings what you can accomplish in one.
 - This is the hard part. Knowing and admitting a problem are not the same as solving it. But executing a solution is also the fun part, because the solution save you and gets you moving again.
 - Reading, conversation, environment, culture, heroes, mentors, nature – all are lottery tickets for creativity. Scratch away at them and you’ll find out how big a prize you’ve won.
 - Creativity requires quite a lot of faith – not just in yourself but also in the knowledge that you have the right to proceed, even when you may not know exactly what you’re doing.
 - I think that anyone who’s pushed to do the very best that they can is privileged. It’s a luxury.

 - I’m a known reader. That’s what I do with my time.
 - It is extremely arrogant and very foolish to think that you can ever outwit your audience.
 - Mastery is an elusive concept. You never know when you achieve it absolutely and it may not help you to feel you’ve attained it. We can recognize it more readily in others than we can in ourselves. We have to discover our own definition of it.
 - By making the start of the sequence automatic, they replace doubt and fear with comfort and routine.
 - I do everything I know how in a dance.
 - I understand things that are American, for better or worse.
 - I have a sort of tactility about music. I go into record stores and just run my fingers over it, the spines.
 - I have to feel that each thing I’ve learned I can push to another point next time. I’m not very good with repetition. I would rather not work than feel that repetition is the order of the day.
 - I was valedictorian. Did I enjoy going to school? I hated it. It wasn’t a choice on my part, it was expected.
 - You only need one good reason to commit to an idea, not four hundred. But if you have four hundred reasons to say yes and one reason to say no, the answer is probably no.
 - I think that probably the moments of discovery do come from a place that is not totally organized. Order is something that we already know about. Discoveries are in a place we don’t already know about.

 - A young person has to start making decisions for themselves at a much earlier age than an overbearing parent allows one.
 - There really is nothing I ever had access to that I didn’t appreciate.
 - I can’t emphasize this idea enough. Getting involved with your collaborator’s problems almost always distracts you from your own. That can be tempting. That can be a relief. But it usually leads to disaster.
 - With each piece I’ve completed I have worked to make it intact, and each of them has been an equal high. It’s like children. A mother refuses to pick out one as a favorite, and I can’t do any better with the dances.
 - I’m willing to be regarded as a tyrant to keep my vision intact.
 - There’s this expression called postmodernism, which is kind of silly, and destroys a perfectly good word called modern, which now no longer means anything.
 - That’s what improvising is like for me. There’s no tollbooth between my impulse and my action.
 - In the not-for-profit world, there can be wastefulness because there’s not the desperate urgency of when you’re on a clock.
 - Life is about moving, it’s about change. And when things stop doing that they’re dead.
 - Whether or not God has kissed your brow, you still have to work. Without learning and preparation, you won’t know how to harness the power of that kiss.

 - I think people want very much to simplify their lives enough so that they can control the things that make it possible to sleep at night.

 - In creative endeavors luck is a skill.
 - The formal education that I received made little sense to me.
 - I was fortunate to love men, so I could put them on stage and make roles for them, and move through their bodies in a way that they enjoy doing.

 - I was privileged to be able to study a year with Martha Graham, the last year she was teaching.
 - There is obviously a power and a truth in action that doesn’t lie, which words easily can do.
 - Every work of art needs a spine – an underlying theme, a motive for coming into existence. It doesn’t have to be apparent to the audience. But you need it at the start of the creative process to guide you and keep you going.
 - A lot of people insisted on a wall between modern dance and ballet. I’m beginning to think that walls are very unhealthy things.
 - If you only do what you know and do it very, very well, chances are that you won’t fail. You’ll just stagnate, and your work will get less and less interesting, and that’s failure by erosion.
 - Easily acquired. Inexpensive. Perfectly functional. Portable. Identifiable. Disposable. Eternal enough. These are my criteria for the perfect storage system. And I’ve found the answer in the simple file box.
 - My mother was a dominant force in my life. She had a very specific idea about education, which was: you should know everything about everything. It was quite simple. There was no exclusivity, and there really was no judgment.
 - I began ear training when I was about six months old. My mother was a concert pianist, and she started all of her children with music before they were a year old. Then she began to see that I had a musical gift.

 - Doing is better than not doing, and if you do something badly you’ll learn to do it better.
 - When I’m in the studio, when I’m warm, when I’m what people call improvising, I feel a very special connection. I feel the most right. I don’t want to become too mystic about this, but things feel as though they’re in the best order at that particular moment.

 - I learned very early that an audience would relax and look at things differently if they felt they could laugh with you from time to time. There’s an energy that comes through the release of tension that is laughter.
 - The disasteris not the money, although the money will be missed. The disaster is the disrespect – this belief that the arts are dispensable, that they’re not critical to a culture’s existence.
 - I’m much stronger than most women. When I work with men, or when I’m partnered by men, we can actually go into kinds of movement that haven’t been available before, simply because I’ve strengthened myself as a woman, not because I’ve weakened him.

 - I’m not one who divides music, dance or art into various categories. Either something works, or it doesn’t.
