 - The man who will present Christ to others must be occupied with Christ for Himself.
 - What we have in Christ Jesus-Redemption through His blood is the beginning and foundation of everything.
 - Nothing can touch the Word of God. Not all the powers of earth and hell, men and devils combined, can ever move the Word of God. There it stands, in its own moral glory, spite of all the assaults of the enemy, from age to age. ‘For ever, 0 Lord, Thy Word is settled in heaven.’
 - It is much better to be drawn by the joys of heaven, than driven by the sorrows of earth.

 - People are so prone to lean upon gifted men. And if they cannot have such, they get discouraged and scattered, instead of getting lovingly together and helping one another by their mutual faith.
 - It is vain to speak of approaching judgment when finding our place, our portion, and our enjoyment in the very scene which is to be judged.
 - Love to Christ is proved by doing the things which He commands, and not merely saying, Lord, Lord.
