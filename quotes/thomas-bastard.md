 - A black sheep is a biting beast.
 - Age is deformed, youth unkind, We scorn their bodies, they our mind.
 - Fishing, if I a fisher may protest, Of pleasures is the sweetest of sports the best, Of exercises the most excellent, Of recreations the most innocent. But now the sport is marred, and why you ask? Fishes decrease, and fishers multiply.
