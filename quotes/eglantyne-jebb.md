 - Every war is a war against children.
 - Humanity owes the child the best it has to give.
 - Save the Children is often told that its aims are impossible – that there has always been child suffering and there always will be. We know. It’s impossible only if we make it so. It’s impossible only if we refuse to attempt it.
 - Every generation of children offers mankind the possibility of rebuilding his ruin of a world.
 - We have to devise means of making known the facts in such a way as to touch the imagination of the world.
 - All wars, whether just or unjust, disastrous or victorious, are waged against the child.
