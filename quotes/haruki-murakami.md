 - And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.
 - Unfortunately, the clock is ticking, the hours are going by. The past increases, the future recedes. Possibilities decreasing, regrets mounting.
 - Be fearless, be brave, be bold, love yourself.
 - When I'm running I don't have to talk to anybody and don't have to listen to anybody. This is a part of my day I can't do without.

 - Learning another language is like becoming another person.

 - Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.

 - If you’re in pitch blackness, all you can do is sit tight until your eyes get used to the dark.
 - You’re not a kid anymore. You have the right to choose your own life. You can start again. If you want a cat, all you have to do is choose a life in which you can have a cat. It’s simple. It’s your right.
 - The thing I’m most afraid of is me. Of not knowing what I’m going to do. Of not knowing what I’m doing right now.

 - If you can love someone with your whole heart, even one person, then there’s salvation in life. Even if you can’t get together with that person.
 - Say it before you run out of time. Say it before it’s too late. Say what you’re feeling. Waiting is a mistake.

 - A theory is a battlefield in your head.
 - To keep on going, you have to keep up the rhythm.

 - Start making excuses and there’s no end to it. I can’t live that kind of life.

 - No matter how honestly you open up to someone, there are still things you cannot reveal.
 - Only the Dead stay seventeen forever.
 - You can keep as quiet as you like, but one of these days somebody is going to find you.
 - But I didn’t understand then. That I could hurt somebody so badly she would never recover. That a person can, just by living, damage another human being beyond repair.
 - Distance might not solve anything, no matter how far you run.
 - I never made any plan before writing, however I succeeded. I enjoyed writing with excitement ,“what happen on the next page?”
 - Love can rebuild the world, they say, so everything’s possible when it comes to love.
 - Why do people have to be this lonely? What’s the point of it all? Millions of people in this world, all of them yearning, looking to others to satisfy them, yet isolating themselves. Why? Was the earth put here just to nourish human loneliness?
 - If I have left a wound inside you, it is not just your wound but mine as well.

 - No matter what the situation may be, I still take pleasure in witnessing the joy of others.
 - Time flows in strange ways on Sundays, and sights become mysteriously distorted.

 - Dreams come from the past, not from the future. Dreams shouldn’t control you – you should control them.
 - There’s no such thing as perfect writing, just like there’s no such thing as perfect despair.
 - Living like an empty shell is not really living, no matter how many years it may go on. The heart and flesh of an empty shell give birth to nothing more than the life of an empty shell.
 - I may not be the most likable person in the world, but I try not to upset people.
 - Does G get angry because it follows F in the alphabet? Does page 68 in a book start a revolution because it follows 67?
 - I said nothing for a time, just ran my fingertips along the edge of the human-shaped emptiness that had been left inside me.
 - Huge organizations and me don’t get along. They’re too inflexible, waste too much time, and have too many stupid people.
 - A friend to kill time is a friend sublime.
 - I think history is collective memories. In writing, I’m using my own memory, and I’m using my collective memory.
 - It’s just like Yeats said. In dreams begin responsibilities. Flip this around and you could say that where there’s no power to imagine, no responsibility can arise.
 - Time, of course, topples everyone in its path equally- the way that driver beats his old horse until it dies. But the thrashing we receive is one of frightful gentleness. Few of us even realize that we are being beaten.
 - Sometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions. You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm adjusts.
 - All imperfections are forced upon the imperfect, so the ‘perfect’ can live content and oblivious.
 - I feel like I’ve swallowed a cloudy sky.
 - She’s letting out her feelings. The scary thing is not being able to do that. When your feelings build up and harden and die inside, then you’re in big trouble.
 - What we call the present is given shape by an accumulation of the past.
 - Losing you is most difficult for me, but the nature of my love for you is what matters. If it distorts into half-truth, then perhaps it is better not to love you. I must keep my mind but loose you.

 - As long as I kept my body moving I could forget about the emptiness inside.
 - What I feel for her is a wholly different emotion. It stands and walks on its own, living and breathing and throbbing and shaking me to the roots of my being.
 - If I stayed here, something inside me would be lost forever – something I couldn’t afford to lose. It was like a vague dream, a burning, unfulfilled desire. The kind of dream people have only when they’re seventeen.
 - There weren’t any curtains in the windows, and the books that didn’t fit into the bookshelf lay piled on the floor like a bunch of intellectual refugees.
 - Not just beautiful, though – the stars are like the trees in the forest, alive and breathing. And they’re watching me.
 - We knew exactly what we wanted in each other. And even so, it ended. One day it stopped, as if the film simply slipped off the reel.
 - I get up early in the morning, 4 o’clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that’s enough. In the afternoon, I run.
 - People lose fifty million skin cells every day. The cells get scraped off and turn into invisible dust, and disappear into the air. Maybe we are nothing but skin cells as far as the world is concerned.
 - Memories and thoughts age, just as people do. But certain thoughts can never age, and certain memories can never fade.
 - Writing a long novel is like survival training. Physical strength is as necessary as artistic sensitivity.
 - Running taught me to have faith in my skills as a writer. I learned how much I can demand of myself, when I need a break, and when the break starts to get too long. I known how hard I am allowed to push myself.
 - Exhaustion pays no mind to age or beauty. Like rain and earthquakes and hail and floods.
 - Open your eyes, train your ears, use your head. If a mind you have, then use it while you can.
 - Some things, you know, if you say them, it makes them not true?
 - One of these days they’ll be making a film where the whole human race gets wiped out in a nuclear war, but everything works out in the end.
 - This is no honky-tonk parade. 1Q84 is the real world, where a cut draws real blood, where pain is real pain and fear is real fear. The moon in the sky is no paper moon.
 - I am worrying about my country. I feel I have a responsibility as a novelist to do something.
 - I can be hurt, you know. I can get as exhausted as anybody else. I can feel so bad I want to cry, too.
 - Deep rivers run quiet.
 - Everybody has to start somewhere. You have your whole future ahead of you. Perfection doesn’t happen right away.
 - When people tell a lie about something, they have to make up a bunch of lies to go with the first one. ‘Mythomania’ is the word for it.
 - People with dark souls have nothing but dark dreams. People with really dark souls do nothing but dream.
 - Life is a lot more fragile than we think. So you should treat others in a way that leaves no regrets. Fairly, and if possible, sincerely.

 - In long-distance running the only opponent you have to beat is yourself, the way you used to be.
 - Here, too, a brand-new day is beginning. It could be a day like all the others, or it could be a day remarkable enough in many ways to remain in the memory. In either case, for now, for most people, it is a blank sheet of paper.

 - Wherever there’s hope there’s a trial.
 - That’s what the world is, after all: an endless battle of contrasting memories.

 - No matter how much suffering you went through, you never wanted to let go of those memories.

 - Most everything you think you know about me is nothing more than memories.
 - Life: I’ll never understand it.
 - It’s like a kid standing at the window watching the rain.
 - Find me now. Before someone else does.
 - Have you ever had that feeling – that you’d like to go to a whole different place and become a whole different self?
 - Nobody likes being alone that much. I don’t go out of my way to make friends, that’s all. It just leads to disappointment.
 - What I think is this: You should give up looking for lost cats and start searching for the other half of your shadow.
 - I am a flawed human being – a far more flawed human being than you realize.
 - It doesn’t matter how old I get, but as long as I continue to live I’ll always discover something new about myself.
 - I think that my job is to observe people and the world, and not to judge them. I always hope to position myself away from so-called conclusions. I would like to leave everything wide open to all the possibilities in the world.

 - If you can’t understand it without an explanation, you can’t understand it with an explanation.

 - I just feel pain. A lot of pain. I thought I could imagine how much this would hurt but I was wrong.
 - Not everything was lost in the flow of time.
 - Why do I act like this, agreeing when I really disagree, letting people force me to do things I don’t want to do?
 - It’s easy to forget things you don’t need anymore.
 - Inside that darkness, i saw rain falling on the sea. Rain softly falling on a vast sea, with no one there to see it. The rain strikes the surface of the sea, yet even the fish don’t know it is raining.
 - Anyone who falls in love is searching for the missing pieces of themselves. So anyone who’s in love gets sad when they think of their lover. It’s like stepping back inside a room you have fond memories of, one you haven’t seen in a long time.

 - No matter what they wish for, no matter how far they go, people can never be anything but themselves. That’s all.
 - In everybody’s life there’s a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can’t go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That’s how we survive.
 - Most of what I know about writing I’ve learned through running every day.
 - I don’t care what you do to me, but I don’t want you to hurt me. I’ve had enough hurt already in my life. More than enough. Now I want to be happy.
 - The sky grew darker, painted blue on blue, one stroke at a time, into deeper and deeper shades of night.
 - I have this strange feeling that I’m not myself anymore. It’s hard to put into words, but I guess it’s like I was fast asleep, and someone came, disassembled me, and hurriedly put me back together again. That sort of feeling.
 - Everything passes. Nobody gets anything for keeps. And that’s how we’ve got to live.
 - Until the bitter end, the emptiness inside her was hers alone.

 - Reaching the finish line, never walking, and enjoying the race. These three, in this order, are my goals.
 - While they’re still alive, people can become ghosts.

 - Whenever I look at the ocean, I always want to talk to people, but when I’m talking to people, I always want to look at the ocean.
 - Sometimes you’re just the sweetest thing. Like Christmas, summer vacation, and a brand-new puppy rolled into one.
 - The sad truth is that certain types of things can’t go backward. Once they start going forward, no matter what you do, they can’t go back the way they were. If even one little thing goes awry, then that’s how it will stay forever.

 - A gentleman is someone who does not what he wants to do, but what he should do.
 - No truth can cure the sorrow we feel from losing a loved one. No truth, no sincerity, no strength, no kindness can cure that sorrow. All we can do is see it through to the end and learn something from it, but what we learn will be no help in facing the next sorrow that comes to us without warning.
 - I think I’ll stay alive here a bit longer, and see with my own eyes what’s going to happen. I can still die after that – it won’t be too late. Probably.

 - So I made up my mind I was going to find someone who would love me unconditionally three hundred and sixty-five days a year. Watanabe: Wow, and did your search pay off? M: That’s the hard part. I guess I’ve been waiting so long I’m looking for perfection. That makes it tough.

 - Sometimes when I think of life, I feel like a piece of driftwood washed up on shore.

 - Life is like a box of cookies.
 - It’s a dark, cool, quiet place. A basement in your soul. And that place can sometimes be dangerous to the human mind. I can open the door and enter that darkness, but I have to be very careful. I can find my story there. Then I bring that thing to the surface, into the real world.
 - I was feeling lonely without her, but the fact that I could feel lonely at all was consolation. Loneliness wasn’t such a bad feeling. It was like the stillness of the pin oak after the little birds had flown off.
 - Sometimes when I look at you, I feel I’m gazing at a distant star. It’s dazzling, but the light is from tens of thousands of years ago. Maybe the star doesn’t even exist any more. Yet sometimes that light seems more real to me than anything.

 - Isn’t life strange? There are people who have so many leftover clothes they can’t stuff them all in their wardrobe. And then there are people like me, whose socks never match.

 - Still, in the end, we all die just the same.
 - Things outside you are projections of what’s inside you, and what’s inside you is a projection of what’s outside. So when you step into the labyrinth outside you, at the same time you’re stepping into the labyrinth inside.

 - Nothing so consumes a person as meaningless exertion.
 - It was a small room with dim light coming in the window, reminiscent of old Polish films.

 - Sometimes I feel like a caretaker of a museum – a huge, empty museum where no one ever comes, and I’m watching over it for no one but myself.
 - The answer is dreams. Dreaming on and on. Entering the world of dreams and never coming out. Living in dreams for the rest of time.
