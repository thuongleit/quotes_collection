 - The conquest of space is worth the risk of life.
 - There is a clarity, a brilliance to space that simply doesn’t exist on earth, even on a cloudless summer’s day in the Rockies, and nowhere else can you realize so fully the majesty of our Earth and be so awed at the thought that it’s only one of untold thousands of planets.
 - How do you expect to get us to the Moon if you people can’t even hook us up with a ground station?
 - If we die, we want people to accept it. We are in a risky business, and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life.
 - If we die, do not mourn for us. This is a risky business we’re in, and we accept those risks. The space program is too valuable to this country to be halted for too long if a disaster should ever happen.
