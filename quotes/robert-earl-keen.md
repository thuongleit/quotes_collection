 - I went to the movies with my little Peggy Sue, I had a dip there in my lip just like I always do.
 - It must have been the summer of 1967, the Beatles were singing love is all you need. I held her hand as we walked through the arcades.
 - I’ve known a whole lot of bulls in my time, and their work is never done.
 - I passed out in our front yard. But honey, don’t turn out the light, cause I think I’m in the mood for love tonight.
