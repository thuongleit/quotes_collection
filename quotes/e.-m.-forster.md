 - The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race.
 - We cast a shadow on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to place to save things; because the shadow always follows.

 - What is wonderful about great literature is that it transforms the man who reads it towards the condition of the man who wrote.

 - Unless we remember we cannot understand.
 - For you cannot have gentility without paying for it.
 - The tragedy of preparedness has scarcely been handled, save by the Greeks. Life is indeed dangerous, but not in the way morality would have us believe. It is indeed unmanageable, but the essence of it is not a battle. It is unmanageable because it is a romance, and its essence is romantic beauty.
 - Our life on earth is, and ought to be, material and carnal. But we have not yet learned to manage our materialism and carnality properly; they are still entangled with the desire for ownership.

 - You can transmute love, ignore it, muddle it, but you can never pull it out of you.

 - What the world most needs today are negative virtues – not minding people, not being huffy, touchy, irritable or revengeful.
 - My law-givers are Erasmus and Montaigne, not Moses and St Paul.
 - A happy ending was imperative. I shouldn’t have bothered to write otherwise. I was determined that in fiction anyway two men should fall in love and remain in it for the ever and ever that fiction allows, and in this sense, Maurice and Alec still roam the greenwood.

 - One can run away from women, turn them out, or give in to them. No fourth course.
 - In the creative state a man is taken out of himself.
 - The people I respect most behave as if they were immortal and as if society was eternal. Both assumptions are false: both of them must be accepted as true if we are to go on eating and working and loving, and are to keep open a few breathing holes for the human spirit.

 - But nothing in India is identifiable, the mere asking of a question causes it to disappear or to merge in something else.

 - I would rather be a coward than brave because people hurt you when you are brave.

 - Suspense: the only literary tool that has any effect upon tyrants and savages.

 - Love and understand the Italians, for the people are more marvellous than the land.
 - Oxford is Oxford: not a mere receptacle for youth, like Cambridge. Perhaps it wants its inmates to love it rather than to love one another.

 - Neanderthal man listened to stories, if one may judge by the shape of his skull.
 - Logic! Good gracious! What rubbish!
 - In the creative state a man is taken out of himself. He lets down as it were a bucket into his subconscious, and draws up something which is normally beyond his reach. He mixes this thing with his normal experiences and out of the mixture he makes a work of art.
 - To make us feel small in the right way is a function of art; men can only make us feel small in the wrong way.

 - Very notable was his distinction between coarseness and vulgarity, coarseness, revealing something; vulgarity, concealing something.
 - I do not believe in Belief.
 - A poem is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself.
 - I’d far rather leave a thought behind me than a child. Other people can have children.
 - It is the function of the novelist to reveal the hidden life at its source: to tell us more about Queen Victoria than could be known, and thus to produce a character who is not the Queen Victoria of history.
 - It is not that the Englishman can’t feel-it is that he is afraid to feel. He has been taught at his public school that feeling is bad form. He must not express great joy or sorrow, or even open his mouth too wide when he talks-his pipe might fall out if he did.

 - England still waits for the supreme moment of her literature – for the great poet who shall voice her, or, better still, for the thousand little poets whose voices shall pass into our common talk.

 - It is my fate and perhaps my temperament to sign agreements with fools.
 - England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.

 - She loved him absolutely, perhaps for half an hour.
 - The middle age of buggers is not to be contemplated without horror.
 - It is never possible for a novelist to deny time inside the fabric of his novel: he must cling, however lightly, to the thread of his story, he must touch the interminable tapeworm, otherwise he becomes unintelligible, which, in his case, is a blunder.
 - There are moments when the inner life actually ‘pays,’ when years of self-scrutiny, conducted for no ulterior motive, are suddenly of practical use.
 - All invitations must proceed from heaven perhaps; perhaps it is futile for men to initiate their own unity, they do but widen the gulfs between them by the attempt.
 - But I have seen my obstacles: trivialities, learning and poetry. This last needs explaining: the old artist’s readiness to dissolve characters into a haze. Characters cannot come alive and fight and guide the world unless the novelist wants them to remain characters.
 - All this fame and money, which have so thrilled me when they came to others, leave me cold when they come to me. I am not an ascetic, but I don’t know what to do with them, and my daily life has never been so trying, and there is no one to fill it emotionally.

 - He had shown her all the workings of his soul, mistaking this for love.
 - Only a writer who has the sense of evil can make goodness readable.

 - Science explained people, but could not understand them. After long centuries among the bones and muscles it might be advancing to knowledge of the nerves, but this would never give understanding.

 - It is pleasant to be transferred from an office where one is afraid of a sergeant-major into an office where one can intimidate generals, and perhaps this is why history is so attractive to the more timid among us. We can recover self-confidence by snubbing the dead.

 - Only people who have been allowed to practise freedom can have the grown-up look in their eyes.
 - As long as learning is connected with earning, as long as certain jobs can only be reached through exams, so long must we take this examination system seriously. If another ladder to employment was contrived, much so-called education would disappear, and no one would be a penny the stupider.
 - Axiom : Novel must have either one living character or a perfect pattern: fails otherwise.
 - One grows accustomed to being praised, or being blamed, or being advised, but it is unusual to be understood.
 - Intuition attracts those who wish to be spiritual without any bother, because it promises a heaven where the intuitions of others can be ignored.
 - An efficiency-regime cannot be run without a few heroes stuck about it to carry off the dullness – much as plums have to be put into bad pudding to make it palatable.
 - I only wish the poets would say this too: love is of the body; not the body, but of the the body. Ah! the misery that would be saved if we confessed that! Ah! for a little directness to liberate the soul!
