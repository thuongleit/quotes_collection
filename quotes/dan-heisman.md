 - Don’t be afraid of losing, be afraid of playing a game and not learning something.
 - Don’t worry about your rating, work on your playing strength and your rating will follow.
 - If you are interested in improving, think of a draw offer as an offer to remain ignorant of what you would have learned in the remainder of the game.
 - When you trade, the key concern is not always the value of the pieces being exchanged, but what’s left on the board.
