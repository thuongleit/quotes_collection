 - When hints of sadness creep into our soul, we must not flee into happy or distracting thoughts. Pondering the sadness until it becomes overwhelming can lead us to deep change in the direction of our being from self-preservation to grateful worship.
 - The degree to which we openly express our feelings should be governed, not by fear of reprisal, but by our commitment to loving others.
 - The goal of our sanctification is that we place Christ on display in the way we love others.
 - A vision we give to others of who and what they could become has power when it echoes what the spirit has already spoken into their souls.
 - The real power in helping somebody to be transformed is not to do something to them but to join with them.
 - If we look for ways to get rid of necessary pain, we’ll be disillusioned or misled. For people who define real change as the elimination of inevitable struggle, the final chapters will be terribly disappointing.
 - Change from the inside out involves a steadfast gaze upon our Lord that’s life changing because it reflects a deep turning from a commitment to self-sufficiency. Without repentance, a look at Christ provides only the illusion of comfort.
 - God is always working to make His children aware of a dream that remains alive beneath the rubble of every shattered dream, a new dream that when realized will release a new song, sung with tears, till God wipes them away and we sing with nothing but joy in our hearts.
 - We were designed to love and when we do, something good develops inside. We feel clean, rich, whole. Even better, we become less concerned with how we feel and more concerned with the lives of others.

 - The problem sincere Christians have with God often comes down to a wrong understanding of what this life is meant to provide.
 - I assume the Spirit is always whispering, “Abba”, to God’s children, assuring them that they are safe in His care. And he is continually calling them to become what God saved them to be, solid people, indestructibly alive, hurting perhaps, but consumed with pleasing the Father.
 - Other forms of relating to God that have unique value in connecting us to Him include contemplative prayer and centering prayer.
 - I hear Jesus telling us to stop negotiating with Him, to stop offering something we think we have in exchange for His blessings.
 - In order to meaningfully repent of the ways in which we violate love, we must recognize them. We won’t recognize self-protective patterns of relating as sinful violations of love until we face the disappointment in our soul we’re determined never to experience again.
