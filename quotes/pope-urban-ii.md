 - Undertake this journey for the remission of your sins, with the assurance of the imperishable glory of the Kingdom of Heaven!
 - Let those who once fought against brothers and relatives now rightfully fight against barbarians.
 - All who die by the way, whether by land or by sea, or in battle against the pagans, shall have immediate remission of sins. This I grant them through the power of God with which I am invested...
 - He that taketh not his cross and followeth after me, is not worthy of me.
 - Christians, hasten to help your brothers in the East, for they are being attacked. Arm for the rescue of Jerusalem under your captain Christ. Wear his cross as your badge. If you are killed your sins will be pardoned.
 - O what a disgrace if such a despised and base race, which worships demons, should conquer a people which has the faith of omnipotent God and is made glorious with the name of Christ!
