 - I look around and I know there’s a lot in the world that I want to see changed – and I want to be a part of something bigger than myself. I want to see things change, in myself as much as in the world around me.
 - I use to think that the friction was a bad thing. Everything is to ease pain in our society; pain is very much the enemy. And I don’t think that’s true. Tension is a good thing. To be pulled tight: that’s the only way you can make a proper noise on the guitar or violin.
 - Life is a battlefield. I don’t have enough time on the planet to play games.
 - Live rather than talk. Talk is cheap and the tabloids scream about it every day.
 - Nothing stays together without a fight.
 - Happiness is like peeing in your pants. Everyone can see it, but only you can feel the warmth.
 - What you do with your life is ascribing more to what you invest your time in. If you spend a lot of time on your phone, you’re ascribing more worship to that. Anything can become, by that definition, some form of idol or deity or ultimate worth in your life.
 - My challenge is, do not run away from the hard questions. Truly ask yourself what’s worth living for in this life.

 - I don’t think we can solve the outside problems until we solve the ones within.
 - I think of myself as more of a lover rather than a fighter, but sometimes you have to fight for what you love.
 - If you truly love someone, you’re going to be pure because true love comes from God, and God tells us to remain pure. That’s good enough for me.

 - If we spend our time obsessing with the future or regretting the past, then we will never live. Tomorrow will always be tomorrow and yesterday cannot be changed.
 - Every day of your life, you change the world. Absolutely, yes, we’re out to change the world. I mean, you change it whether you like it or not. You wake up and you talk to the grocer. You either kick your dog or you pet him. There’s a million decisions you have every day where you change the world.

 - Think deeply about life, it’s worth it!
 - Music is admitted under the skin without permission.
 - For me songs are born out of the gray space, the things I don’t fully understand, the things that I can’t put in my pocket.
 - Just as drowning cannot be equated with swimming, mere existence is not the same as abundant life. We have been offered a new way to live – a new way to be human.
 - If you can have a couple of tight friends that you can tell things to, that you can say, ‘Hey, this is what I’m struggling with,’ and then pray and talk about it, then that’s an incredible thing.
 - I do have an obligation, however, a debt that cannot be settled by my lyrical decisions. My life will be judged by my obedience, not my ability to confine my lyrics to this box or that.
 - Music will always be judged by our subjective ears.
 - I look for places where there’s no one out on the water. I’d rather surf a wave to myself than fight a crowd.
 - What do we really want to say to the world? Three main themes. The inability to find completion in our modern society, the inability to find completion within ourselves, and the new way to be human in what Christ offers us – His love and His perfect plan of redemption for us.
 - Maybe truth is not something that I can possess. Maybe truth is something which possesses me.

 - If you’re leaving your family behind, you better believe in what you’re singing.
 - The biggest thing that I’ve learned is to run the marathon, not the sprint. By that I mean, don’t let the little problems that you face in the hour in daily life cast a shadow over the larger joys that you have, over the course of the years.
 - Let no debt remain outstanding, except the continuing debt to love another.
 - I’m really only responsible to make sure that one person is clapping at the end of my life. Because I feel like as a performer, a lot of times you live for everyone else’s applause. That’s a dangerous thing within the church or outside the church.

 - Inside all of us, we know the truth of life that there’s something more than the next new cell phone or gadget or relationship and that our heart beats in time with the sunset.
 - Experience is all I have. I equate song-writing with archeology. Every day you dig. You dig into different places within yourself – even finding places that you’ve rarely been. And buried within the soil is song.

 - The kingdom of heaven is comprised of the broken, the fatherless, the poor, the starving. Nothing that could create good ratings for NBC.
 - Jesus Christ’s mercy and power indwells us and gives us the strength to make a positive difference.
 - Hope is not something you can just place in your back pocket or put your fingers around – it’s the belief in a world that has yet to exist.
 - Sometimes it can be really hard in our fast paced society to slow ourselves down enough to begin to listen to God’s voice. The dilemma exists in my position as well. To be a follower of Christ is to emulate Him. When He went off alone into the desert to pray, He was teaching a valuable lesson.
 - There are tears that shine like a smile, sobbing like a sunrise for the truth.
 - Being a creator of a song I get to take all these broken fragments of failure and chaos and weave together something beautiful and meaningful. Decay. Death. Pain. Fall. And if God is a songwriter then these fallen leaves of mine can be redeemed.

 - I think that’s the beauty of live music – creating from the destruction.
 - It’s a great thing to see the strength of simplicity.
