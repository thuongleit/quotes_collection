 - Dance is your pulse, your heartbeat, your breathing. It’s the rhythym of your life.
 - You can dance anywhere and you can dance in your mind, in your heart.
 - A wild, untamed youth learns nobility through art.
 - Who am I? I’m a man; an American, a father, a teacher, but most of all, I am a person who knows how the arts can change lives, because they transformed mine. I was a dancer.
 - Every time I dance I have a high. I mean every time I danced, it was the whole world was the stage and I was in control of it and there was a form and a ritual and yet it was spontaneous and life didn’t matter after that of before.
 - So, I think I would say, enjoy the process of learning to dance. The process of our profession, and not its final achievement, is the heart and soul of dance.
