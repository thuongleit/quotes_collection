 - Faith is only real when there is obedience, never without it, and faith only becomes faith in the act of obedience.

 - We must be ready to allow ourselves to be interrupted by God.
 - Christianity means community through Jesus Christ and in Jesus Christ. No Christian community is more or less than this.

 - The test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children.
 - Self-justification and judging others go together, as justification by grace and serving others go together.
 - Only he who believes is obedient and only he who is obedient believes.

 - Discipleship is not an offer that man makes to Christ.

 - The time is short. Eternity is long. It is the time of decision.

 - If you reject God’s commanding word, you will not receive God’s gracious word.

 - Once again, Jesus calls those who follow him to share his passion.
 - A righteous person is one who lives for the next generation.
 - If Jesus Christ is not true God, how could he help us? If he is not true man, how could he help us?
 - Prayer does not mean simply to pour out one’s heart. It means rather to find the way to God and to speak with him, whether the heart is full or empty.
 - The first service that one owes to others consists in listening to them.
 - We are so afraid of silence that we chase ourselves from one event to the next in order not to have to spend a moment alone with ourselves, in order not to have to look at ourselves in the mirror.
 - The physical presence of other Christians is a source of incomparable joy and strength to the believer.

 - There is meaning in every journey that is unknown to the traveler.
 - God is in the manger, wealth in poverty, light in darkness, succor in abandonment. No evil can befall us; whatever men may do to us, they cannot but serve the God who is secretly revealed as love and rules the world and our lives.

 - Whenever Christ calls us, His call leads us to death.
 - God honors some with great suffering and grants them the grace of martyrdom, while other are not tempted beyond their strength. But in every case it is one cross.

 - The more genuine and the deeper our community becomes, the more will everything else between us recede, the more clearly and purely will Jesus Christ and His work become the one and only thing that is vital between us.
 - Love asks nothing in return, but seeks those who need it. And who needs our love more than those who are consumed with hatred and are utterly devoid of love.

 - Judging others makes us blind, whereas love is illuminating.
 - A god who let us prove his existence would be an idol.
 - The exclusion of the weak and insignificant, the seemingly useless people, from a Christian community may actually mean the exclusion of Christ; in the poor brother Christ is knocking at the door.
 - The early morning belongs to the Church of the risen Christ. At the break of light it remembers the morning on which death and sin lay prostrate in defeat and new life and salvation were given to mankind.
 - Christian love draws no distinction between one enemy and another, except that the more bitter our enemy’s hatred, the greater his need of love.

 - Love, in the sense of spontaneous, unreflective action, spells the death of the old man.
 - The heart clings to collected treasure. Stored-up possessions get between me and God. Where my treasure is, there is my trust, my security, my comfort, my God. Treasure means idolatry.
 - The entire day receives order and discipline when it acquires unity. This unity must be sought and found in morning prayer. The morning prayer determines the day.
 - A home is a kingdom of it’s own in the midst of the world, a stronghold amid life’s storms and stresses, a refuge, even a sanctuary.
 - Then fear will grow pale and fade away, and you will be free, through your faith in our strong and living Savior, Jesus Christ.
 - By his willingly renouncing self-defence, the Christian affirms his absolute adherence to Jesus, and his freedom from the tyranny of his own ego. The exclusiveness of this adherence is the only power which can overcome evil.
 - A day without morning and evening prayers and personal intercessions is actually a day without meaning or importance.
 - Thus the call to follow Christ always means a call to share the work of forgiving men their sins. Forgiveness is the Christlike suffering which it is the Christian’s duty to bear.

 - The will of God, to which the law gives expression, is that men should defeat their enemies by loving them.
 - There is no worse sin than unbelief toward the gospel.

 - How can God entrust great things to one who will not thankfully receive from Him the little things?
 - The Christian life is participation in the encounter of Christ with the world.
 - The essence of chastity is not the suppression of lust, but the total orientation of one’s life towards a goal. Without such a goal, chastity is bound to become ridiculous. Chastity is the sine qua non of lucidity and concentration.
 - The fact that we do not speak it but sing it only expresses the fact that our spoken words are inadequate to express what we want to say, that the burden of our song goes far beyond all human words.
 - Often we combat our evil thoughts most effectively if we absolutely refuse to allow them to be expressed in words...

 - God has willed that we should seek and find God’s living Word in the testimony of other Christians, in the mouths of human beings.

 - It is a dangerous error, surely very widespread among Christians, to think that the heart can pray by itself.

 - If you do a good job for others, you heal yourself at the same time, because a dose of joy is a spiritual cure.
 - A love that left people alone in their guilt would not have real people as its object. So, in vicarious responsibility for people, and in His love for real human beings, Jesus becomes the one burdened by guilt.
 - It is infinitely easier to suffer in obedience to a human command than to accept suffering as free, responsible men.
 - God’s truth judges created things out of love, and Satan’s truth judges them out of envy and hatred.
