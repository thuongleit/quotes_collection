 - Fantastic fiction covers fantasy, horror and science fiction – and it doesn’t get the attention it deserves from the literati.
 - I’ll never be a minimalist. The fact that the prose is more tightly controlled doesn’t for a minute mean that it’s minimalist. I very much like arcane words and baroque sentence structure.

 - Personally I don’t like it when writers become excessively proscriptive about the way that people read their books.
