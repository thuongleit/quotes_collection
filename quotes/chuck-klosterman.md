 - The message of “The Winner Takes It All” is straightforward: It argues that the concept of relationships ending on mutual terms is an emotional fallacy. One person is inevitably okay and the other is inevitably devastated.

 - Every relationship is fundamentally a power struggle, and the individual in power is whoever likes the other person less.
 - If rain is God crying, I think God is drunk and his girlfriend just slept with Zeus.

 - First, you must love yourself. And if you do that convincingly enough, others will love you too much.

 - Flying to me isn’t scary, it’s just incredibly boring. And I guess I have a fear of boredom, so in that regard, I’m afraid to fly.
 - We are always dying, all the time. That’s what living is; living is dying, little by little. It is a sequenced collection of individualized deaths.

 - I am ready to be alone.
 - Why don’t I like crowds? I suppose the worst possible thing I could say is that I don’t like people, and that crowds are just collections of people. That seems like a very nihilistic way to look at the world.
 - I hate motorcycles. Because if I hit one, even if it’s not my fault, if I’ve done nothing wrong, I’m not charged with manslaughter, he’s gonna die, because he’s on a motorcycle. So I have to live my life knowing that I killed this guy.
 - As of right now, I am in love with her, and that love is the biggest problem in my life.
 - The most wretched people in the world are those who tell you they like every kind of music ‘except country.’ People who say that are boorish and pretentious at the same time.
 - In and of itself, nothing really matters. What matters is that nothing is ever in and of itself.
 - I feel sorry for people who have to edit me. Which is why book writing is by far the most enjoyable. Really the only thing it’s based on is whether it’s good or not. No book editor, in my experience, is getting a manuscript and trying to rewrite it.
 - People who talk about their dreams are actually trying to tell you things about themselves they’d never admit in normal conversation.

 - If you can’t swim, the idea of being in nine feet of water is terrifying, much less the ocean.
 - Real people are actively trying to live like fake people, so real people are no less fake. Every comparison becomes impractical. This is why the impractical has become totally acceptable; impracticality almost seems cool.
 - I want fake love. But that’s all I want, and that’s why I can’t have it.
 - Booze is the greatest of all equalizers. Rich drunks and poor drunks both pass out the same way.

 - Sarcasm is when you tell someone the truth by lying on purpose.
 - I was a teenager in the ’80s – and maybe I’m wrong about this – but it seemed like a bad era for movies that were scary. It was really the height of movies that were disgusting.

 - Styx and The Stones may break my bones but ‘More than Words’ will never hurt me.

 - If you stare long enough at anything, you will start to find similarities. The word “coincidence” exists in order to stop people from seeing meaning where none exists.
 - Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world’s original sin. If cavemen had known how to laugh, history would have been different.
 - Observing someone without context amplifies the experience. The more we know, the less we are able to feel.
 - Science fiction tends to be philosophy for stupid people.

 - That’s like comparing apples with hermaphroditic ground sloths.
 - I hate the point where you have to get off the ladder, or get back on. I don’t know if that’s a fear of heights, or literally a fear of falling. I want to be afraid to fall. That seems like a good fear.
 - The biggest hurdle to writing Fargo Rock City was that I couldn’t afford a home computer – I had to get a new job so I could buy a computer. It could all change though. In five years, I could be back at some daily newspaper, which wouldn’t be so bad.
 - I’m really an alarmist when it comes to epidemics. Swine flu now; when SARS was big, I was all freaked out about that, bird flu. That terrifies me.
