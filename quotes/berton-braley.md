 - The best verse hasn’t been rhymed yet, The best house hasn’t been planned, The highest peak hasn’t been climbed yet, The mightiest rivers aren’t spanned; Don’t worry and fret, faint-hearted, The chances have just begun For the best jobs haven’t been started, The best work hasn’t been done.
 - Take courage, man, be brave and drive ahead, start where you stand.
 - A preposition is a word You mustn’t end a sentence with!
 - Snobbery is the pride of those who are not sure of their position.
 - Back of the beating hammer By which the steel is wrought, Back of the workshop’s clamor The seeker may find the thought.
 - Give a boy a dog and you’ve furnished him a playmate.
 - The future belongs to him that does and dares.
 - Back of the job-the dreamer Who’s making the dream come true!
