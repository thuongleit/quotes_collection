 - Compassion is to look beyond your own pain, to see the pain of others.
 - Let the love of Allah heal you. And free you.

 - It is in that which you love the most that you find the greatest tests.

 - Don’t lie to me. Don’t deceive me. Give me the truth. Even if it breaks me. A painful truth is better than a pleasant lie.

 - When you have friends, don’t expect your friends to fill your emptiness. When you get married, don’t expect your spouse to fulfill your every need. When you’re an activist, don’t put your hope in the results. When you’re in trouble don’t depend on yourself. Don’t depend on people. Depend on Allah.
 - Some hearts understand each other, even in silence.
 - As a Muslim woman, I’ve been liberated from a silent kind of bondage. I don’t answer to the slaves of God on earth. I answer to their King.

 - Seek the ones who never stop caring, who break down your walls, and help you come back to yourself.
 - When someone shows you their heart, their past, their wounds, they have entrusted you with the deepest part of themselves. It is the part of themselves that makes them uniquely beautiful. To be trusted in this way is a great honor. Guard that trust with your life.
 - Oh my heart, there is another way to love. Do not love the gift for what the gift is. Love the gift for Who it came from.
 - Love people for the sake of God, but never love God for the sake of people.
 - If you want the love of the people, stop running after it. The more you chase it, the more it escapes you. Love doesn’t come from the people. It comes from God.
 - There’s a time for words and a time for silence. If you’re listening, you’ll hear the difference.
 - Don’t get attached to moments. Good or bad, they all pass.
 - There’s a special place in my heart for the ones who were with me at my lowest and still loved me when I wasn’t very loveable.

 - Know that transformation sometimes begins with a fall. So never curse the fall.

 - Sometimes the gifts of God aren’t wrapped as we expect.
 - If you wonder how you’ll get through this new heartbreak, just think back. Remember all you’ve been through in the past. And how each time you swore, you’d never get through it. But you did. And look where you’re at now. This too shall pass!
 - Happiness, sadness, loss and gain all pass away. What they do to us is what remains.
 - Beware of what you let enter your heart. There will come a day when you’d give anything to remove it.
 - Keep praying, even if you have only a whisper left.
 - You keep running after the love of the people, but you’ll never get it. And what you do get, will never be enough. The hole inside you is too big. You see, it was made by God, for God. How could anything less fill it?
 - Blessings come in packages of two. With every blessing is a test. So don’t ever envy people who seem to have more than you. The more blessings, the more tests. And the greater the blessing, the harder the test.
