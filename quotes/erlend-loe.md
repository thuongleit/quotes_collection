 - I have the strangest thoughts in my head, maybe I should not write them down.
 - I don’t think I am any different from other people. I have the same dreams. I want a family. I want a house. A car. Why shouldn’t I want that? Everybody does. And when I have it, I want it all to work.
 - Everything seemed meaningless to me. All of a sudden. My own life, the lives of others, of animals of plants, the whole world. It no longer fitted together.
 - I don’t want all that much. But I want to be fine. I want to live a simple life with many good moments and a lot of fun.
 - Everything which is human is alien to me.
 - I have enough trouble with useful information, never mind being burdened with what is useless.
 - Something is going to have to happen. Not necessarily something big. Just something.
 - The only question that really counts, must be thins one: are things getting better or are they getting worse?
 - There are too many confusing things present. Things I know. Thoughts I have. Sarcasm. Things I think I ought to be doing and places I ought to be going. Always other places.
 - I know a helluva lot. I’m not the only one who knows these things. Many people know more than I do. That’s fortunately not my problem. My problem is what I am supposed to use it for. What do I do with it? It’s confusing.
 - I still don’t know if things fit together, or if everything will be all right in the end. But I believe that something means something. I believe in cleansing the soul through fun and games. I also believe in love. And I have several good friends, and just one bad one.
 - It’s good for me to see so many other people who are not me. That there are so many others. I feel affection for them. Most of them are doing the best they can. I am also doing the best I can.
 - When the universe is ephemeral, one can easily feel that human existence is meaningless. Why should I do anything at all? On the other hand it is tempting to try and make the best of it. I’m here, anyway. The imagination won’t cope if I try to picture where I’d otherwise be.
 - I think I’m more concerned with things that are very big and things that are very small than with all the stuff in between.
