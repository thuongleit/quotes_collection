 - I have a double policy, which would also solve immigration: I would stand at the border of New York City and I would say, “You can come here to live, but you can’t come here to visit.”
 - The French probably invented the very notion of discretion. It’s not that they feel that what you don’t know won’t hurt you; they feel that what you don’t know won’t hurt them. To the French lying is simply talking.

 - When you leave New York, you are astonished at how clean the rest of the world is. Clean is not enough.
 - Girls who put out are tramps. Girls who don’t are ladies. This is, however, a rather archaic usage of the word. Should one of you boys happen upon a girl who doesn’t put out, do not jump to the conclusion that you have found a lady. What you have probably found is a Lesbian.
 - Cheese that is required by law to append the word food to its title does not go well with red wine or fruit.

 - In Rome people spend most of their time having lunch. And they do it very well – Rome is unquestionably the lunch capital of the world.
 - My desire to curtail undue freedom of speech extends only to such public areas as restaurants, airports, streets, hotel lobbies, parks, and department stores. Verbal exchanges between consenting adults in private are as of little interest to me as they probably are to them.

 - Any artist who has that quality of timelessness has that quality because they tell the truth.

 - Life was certainly more entertaining when people were indulging their vices as opposed to going to meetings to indulge in a new vice: discussing their innermost thoughts in public.

 - Special-interest publications should realize that if they are attracting enough advertising and readers to make a profit, the interest is not so special.

 - Most writers write too much. I have the exact opposite problem. I feel I could write almost anything in a paragraph. I have a natural ability to condense, and so I often think, “Are you kidding me? Five thousand words? How am I gonna make 5,000 words out of that?”
 - Telling someone he looks healthy isn’t a compliment – it’s a second opinion.
 - Instead of writing it wrong six times and then writing it right, I think it wrong six times and then write it right the seventh time.

 - When I’m supposed to be writing I clean my apartment, take my clothes to the laundry, get organized, make lists, do the dishes. I would never do a dish unless I had to write.
 - New York’s not exactly antiseptic. It could be clean and less dangerous, and not horrible, not under a tidal wave of tourists.
 - Scientists are rarely to be counted among the fun people. Awkward at parties, shy with strangers, deficient in irony – they have had no choice but to turn their attention to the close study of everyday objects.
 - The Italians are the most civilized people. And they’re very warm. Basically, they’re Jews with great architecture.
 - Citizen’s Band radio renders one accessible to a wide variety of people from all walks of life. It should not be forgotten that all walks of life include conceptual artists, dry cleaners, and living poets.

 - I stopped taking drugs when I was 19, and who wants to drive a cab around New York with drugs in their car?
 - Now the culture is made of old things, it’s a collage. Art made out of art is not art. You’re supposed to make art out of life.

 - To me the outdoors is what you must pass through in order to get from your apartment into a taxicab.

 - There are some short essays that are very grave, and most contemporary novels are lighter than air.
 - It’s very important when making a friend to check and see if they have a private plane. People think a good personality trait in a friend is kindness or a sense of humor. No, in a friend a good personality trait is a Gulfstream.
 - Writing pornography is deadly, nothing duller. I mean a toll-taker has a more exciting life than a pornographer.
 - If food did not exist it would be well-nigh impossible to get certain types off the phone, as one would be unable to say, ‘Look, I’ve got to run but let’s have dinner sometime soon.’

 - Not writing is probably the most exhausting profession I’ve ever encountered.
 - Once you go outside your natural audience, there are tons of people that don’t like you.
 - Radio news is bearable. This is due to the fact that while the news is being broadcast, the disk jockey is not allowed to talk.
 - Do not elicit your child’s political opinions. He doesn’t know any more than you do.
 - I think humor is warmer, and wit is colder. Wit is judgment, whereas humor invites some sort of response.
 - I’m not a Communist. I’m an American. I’m a capitalist. I mean, I’m not a very good capitalist, myself. I’m not very good at it, but it’s not that I’m not for capitalism. But people who believe in things like corporate citizenship, it’s idiotic. I mean, it shows you’re an idiot.
 - Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.
 - Never relinquish clothing to a hotel valet without first specifically telling him that you want it back.
 - I doubt there’s ever been a true thing said on Fox. Maybe the weather report, maybe not.

 - If there were, say, only 10 percent of the hotels that exist now, there would be all these apartments for people who live in New York, as opposed to people visiting New York. And then all this junk in the theater, we would no longer need the kind of stuff that tourists like.
 - For the movie review columns, I always knew exactly what I was going to write about – the movies.
 - Whenever I am doing anything else, which is most of the time, even if it is not something like robbing a bank, I feel felonious. Writing is what I’m supposed to be doing.

 - All God’s children are not beautiful. Most of God’s children are, in fact, barely presentable.
 - What I can’t be is monogamous. That tends to upset people. I just don’t like domestic life.
 - If people had gavels, there would be no wars. If every person in the world had a gavel and could bang it and get everyone’s attention right away and make their displeasure known, I believe the level of actual violence in the world would just disappear to practically nothing.
 - I have friends, some of whom are spectacularly good writers, who really want someone to edit them. I don’t register that impulse. It’s like the impulse for wanting a dog.
 - I hate, simply, to work. I just hate to work, period. I am profoundly slothful. Practically inert.
 - A community is a butcher and a doctor, a minister, a town troublemaker. A “community” is not a bunch of people united by some grievance. That’s just self-righteousness – incredibly dangerous and antidemocratic.
 - Writers get exactly the right amount of fame: just enough to get a good table in a restaurant but not enough so that people are constantly interrupting you while you’re eating dinner.

 - You should make it hard on yourself to write so you’re easier to read.

 - No one I knew talked about money. It’s not an area of interest.
 - The second I learned to read in first grade, when I was 5, I preferred it to life. And I still do.
