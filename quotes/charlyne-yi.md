 - Life is too short to be wondering, ‘What if?’
 - Interviewing is tough, especially if you don’t know what you’re looking for.
 - I think sometimes it’s hard to know what you feel, or to know what’s real and what’s not, because love or hate or any feeling is a belief. You can say you hate someone, but you don’t truly know them.
 - Even when I’m stressed out I’m not mean to people. I’m not constantly rude to people. But sometimes people are so rude.
 - You can’t help but feel the energy of the audience – and if you feel they hate you that feels weird and dirty. But I would never want to take it too seriously. It’s understandable that you’re not going to be everyone’s cup of tea. I think that’s helped me survive.
 - Sometimes I feel really bad for the audience. I don’t know how to make them happy. And you just feel drained cause you’re trying everything possible to turn things around. And sometimes it is possible to turn things around on stage, and I’ve done it before, but sometimes it’s impossible.
 - What makes all those women sexy? Were they just born sexy? I guess it’s the way they act. I don’t want to have to act sexy. I just want to be me, and if I don’t happen to be sexy, oh well. That’s OK. I don’t want to force something I’m not.
 - Right now I’m sick of acting, so it’s like, maybe I’ll do writing for a bit. Then, when I’m tired of writing, I’ll go work on my music. When I’m sick of music, I’ll be like, I’m going to start performing comedy now. So it’s good. It’s not like I want to be famous or anything.
 - The idea of surprise is part of what makes something funny, or what gets a reaction. At least when I’m an audience member, after you hear a joke so many times it’s not as funny because it loses its surprise or its twist. So I think funny has to do with surprise.
 - I think you have to be careful about not hurting someone. The last thing I’d want to do is make a fool of someone, unless they saw the humor in it.

 - I wear glasses because I don’t want something tugging my eyeball, but I wouldn’t consider myself a “nerd.” I don’t know what really makes someone a nerd.
 - I think sometimes people forget how to be nice to people. I try not to let it get to me.
 - I think actions really do define how you feel, as opposed to just saying, “I care about you” or “I want to be with you.”

 - Throughout my whole life money has always been a problem. But I didn’t realize that we were poor when we were kids!

 - I just realized that I’m just going to be who I am. I don’t need to adjust how I look for anyone or even for myself. Even if I have a pimple, I’m not going to cover it up with makeup.
