 - If the only tool you have is a hammer, all your problems begin to look like nails. – Abraham Maslow.
 - Be nice, be nice, until it’s time to stop being nice, then destroy them.
 - Only love of a good woman will make a man question every choice, every action. Only love makes a warrior hesitate for fear that his lady will find him cruel. Only love makes a man both the best he will ever be, and the weakest. Sometimes all in the same moment. -Wicked.
 - There comes a point when you either embrace who and what you are, or condemn yourself to be miserable all your days. Other people will try to make you miserable; don’t help them by doing the job yourself.
 - My father had taught me to be nice first, because you can always be mean later, but once you’ve been mean to someone, they won’t believe the nice anymore. So be nice, be nice, until it’s time to stop being nice, then destroy them.
 - People go away and they don’t come back.
 - A girl could never have too much jewelry or too much weaponry.
 - I loved him, but love isn’t enough. All the fairy tales, the romance novels, the soap operas; they’re all lies. Love does not conquer all.
 - Sometimes you fight what you are, and sometimes you give in to it. And some nights you just don’t want to fight yourself anymore, so you pick someone else to fight.
 - I’m not a morning person.
 - Confidence is a fine trait. Over-confidence isn’t.
 - And the moment you care that much, a man has you. He owns a little piece of your soul, and he can beat you to death with it.
 - I think like a detective.

 - Hesitation will get you killed.
 - Giving up something that no longer serves a purpose, or protects you, or helps you, isn’t giving up at all, it’s growing up.
 - Never trust people who smile constantly. They’re either selling something or not very bright.
 - Like most creative people I don’t fit well into boxes.

 - Always having to have the last word is a bad trait. Pisses people off.
 - Is this a private fight, or can anyone join?
 - Love sucks. Sometimes it feels good. Sometimes it’s just another way to bleed.

 - People are supposed to fear the unknown, but ignorance is bliss when knowledge is so damn frightening.
 - Remember your personal demons should be afraid of you, because you are their home, their food, and as you heal, their executioner.
 - Love mattered, in the end. A house without love would always fall, maybe not today or tomorrow, but in the end without love nothing could endure.
 - What do you do when you know you are breaking someone’s heart, but to do anything else would break your own?
 - If you love someone, truly love them, you should never cause them pain. Never fill their eyes with something so close to grief.
 - Maybe they know what I know, that the true way to a man’s heart is six inches of metal between his ribs. Sometimes four inches will do the job, but to be really sure, I like to have six.
 - The truth may not set you free, but used carefully, it can confuse the hell out of your enemies.
 - Every relationship is messed up. What makes it really perfect is if you still want to be there when things suck.
 - A certain type of man, when he loves for the first time, his love is not really love, it is possession. Possessions don’t have rights or feelings; they are something to owned and controlled. He had spent more than a year trying to do just that, and failing.
 - We are not created equal in talent. But the place where we are least equal is the heart. You can work at a talent, take lessons, but love, love either works or it doesn’t. You love someone or you don’t. You can’t change it. You can’t undo it.
 - When God ignores you, the devil starts looking good.
 - A flower may be beautiful all on its own, but a person is never truly beautiful unless someone’s eyes show him that he is beautiful.

 - Not dating is a choice, not a failure.
 - Never criticize, unless you can do a better job.
 - Hatred makes us all ugly.
 - When you apologize, try not to smile at the same time. It ruins the effect.

 - Is death such a high price to pay, when you will die anyway?
 - I never said I was consistent.
 - We hate most in others what we dislike in ourselves.
 - That’s what you get for telling the truth. Someone calls you a liar. Most people will accept a likely lie to an unlikely truth. In fact, they prefer it.
 - No name-calling truly bites deep unless, in some dark part of us, we believe it. If we are confident enough then it is just noise.
 - One of the things cops learn first is that everyone lies. Some people to hide things, some people just for the hell of it, but everyone lies. Assume that everyone is hiding something, it saves time.
 - It’s not about winning, Haven. I’m not a prize to be won. I’m not the princess that needs rescuing from the dragon. I’m the prince and I kill my own monsters. You need to be ok with that. -Anita Blake.
 - Sometimes good and evil aren’t so much opposites as two sides of a coin. You toss it one way and it looks good, another way and it’s evil, sometimes it just depends on which end of the gun you’re on.
 - Accidental sex. He made it sound like I fell down, and there just happened to be an erection in the way.
 - If you fear nothing, then you are not brave. You are merely too foolish to be afraid.
 - It always amazes me how many women like dangerous men. Men who almost from the moment you meet them, you know are bad news. Me, I prefer my men kinder, gentler, nice. Niceness is highly underrated by most people.
 - Sometimes it’s not the optimist you need, but another pessimist to walk beside you and know, absolutely know, that the sound in the dark is a monster, and it really is as bad as you think. Did that sound hopeless? It didn’t feel hopeless. It felt reassuring. It felt – real.
 - If you love someone, then your freedom is curtailed. If you love someone, you give up much of your privacy. If you love someone, then you are no longer merely one person but half of a couple. To think or behave any other way is to risk losing that love.
 - Sometimes love makes you selfish. Sometimes it makes you stupid. Sometimes it reminds you why you love your gun.
 - I will bathe in your warmth ma petite. Roll you around me until my heart beats only for you. My breath will grow warm from your kiss.
 - I am sincere, ma petite, even when I lie.
 - Hatred is a cold fire, and it gives no warmth.
 - When in doubt, ignore and be horribly unimpressed.
 - Some wounds cut us so deep that they stop us. Stop us from letting go, from growing up, from seeing the truth.
 - Love, whether it’s friendship or more, is like a cup. It fills up drop by drop, until one last drop and the cup is full. The liquid hangs there almost above the rim, hangs there on surface tension alone and you know that one more drop and it will spill over.
 - When you dance with the devil, it might as well be a devil who can give you your own corner of hell to rule.
 - I thought of several alec smart remarks, but you should humor crazy people when you’re at their mercy; it’s a rule.
 - Neither love nor evil conquers all, but evil cheats more.
 - Fear will keep you alive; indifference won’t.
 - If you keep a gun in your purse, you get killed, because no woman can find anything in her purse in under twelve minutes. It’s a rule.
 - Death is the last intimate thing we ever do.
 - There is some comfort in killing that which has hurt you, but it is cold comfort. It’ll destroy things inside of you that the original pain wouldn’t have harmed. Sometimes it’s not a question of whether a piece of your soul is going to go missing, only which piece it’s going to be.
 - True love means you love the real person, not an ideal that you have in your head and superimpose over them. That’s illusion and lies to me.
 - It’s better to be loved than feared, but if you can’t be loved, then fear will do.-Dino quoting Machiavelli.
 - Death didn’t bother me much. Strong Christian and all that. Method of death did. Being eaten alive. One of my top three ways not to go out.
 - It feels like we’re in a Harry Potter book talking about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.
 - I kissed him on the cheek and left to find Bobby Lee. Him, I trusted to be in the line of fire. But it was more than that: I wasn’t sleeping with bobby Lee. I didn’t love him. Sometimes love makes you selfish. Sometimes it makes you stupid. Sometimes it reminds you why you love your gun.
 - Give a truly good person power, and they’re still a good person. Give a bad person power, and they’re still a bad person. The question is always about the person in between. The one that isn’t evil, or good, but just ordinary. You don’t always know what an ordinary person is like on the inside.
 - I try to be a good cop. I try to be a good little soldier and follow orders up to a point. But in the end I’m not really a cop, or a soldier. I am a legally sanctioned murderer. I am the Executioner.
 - Love is too precious to be ashamed of.
 - When I was younger, I’d wanted someone to promise me that things would work out and nothing bad would ever happen again. But I understood now that that was a child’s wish. No one could promise that. No one. The grown-ups could try, but they couldn’t promise, not and mean it.
 - I didn’t want to pick at Micah and me until we unraveled. I wanted to leave it alone and enjoy it. I just didn’t know how to do that.
 - Women may get to wear lots of pretty colors, but men get the comfortable shoes. Anita Blake Vampire Hunter.
 - I’d learned a long time ago that you can’t prove a negative. You can prove that you did something, but it’s the devil to prove you didn’t do something.
 - Friends don’t count the cost of favors.
 - Sometimes you deal with the devil not because you want to, but because if you don’t, someone else will.
 - You are an abomination before God. Jesus loves you too, I said smiling.
 - My characters surprise me constantly. My characters are like my friends – I can give them advice, but they don’t have to take it. If your characters are real, then they surprise you, just like real people.
 - Better to assume the worst and be wrong than assume the best and be wrong.
 - I sipped my own coffee, heavy on the sugar and cream, trying to make up for the late work the night before. Caffeine and sugar, the two basic food groups.
 - Pity is an emotion that can get you killed. The only thing more dangerous is blind hate, and maybe love.
 - He had this old southern idea of what a lady should be. A lady should not carry a gun and spend most of her time covered in blood and corpses. I had two words for that attitude. Yeah, those are the words.
 - Sometimes it would be nice not to have to do my best. Sometimes it would just be nice not to have a crisis to deal with. – Anita Blake.
 - That disapproving look was back in her eyes. Her teacher face. The one that could make you squirm from ten paces, even if you were innocent. And I hadn’t been innocent for years.
 - But if anything will turn me off, it’s a very practiced approach, as if the man has done it a thousand times before, to a lot of different women. Which always seems to imply that I am no different from all the rest. Not flattering.
 - He said,’Trust yourself, mon ami. You are not your friend with his so-sad tale. And Anita is not human. Through us she is more than that. Both of us huddle around her humanity like it is the last candle flame in a world of darkness. But by our very love, we make her less human, and more.
 - If I was truly as brave as I thought I was, I’d have let him go. But I loved him, and I wasn’t that brave.

 - There’s no one so self-righteous as someone policing someone else’s morality.
 - Vampires were always either trying to kill me, or own me. God I hated being popular.
 - All I really wanted to do was cuddle back under the blankets, maybe with a certain stuffed toy penguin I knew. Yeah, hiding sounded good.
 - Most women complain that there are no single, straight men left. I’d just like to meet one who’s human.
 - Morals aren’t just for when it’s easy, Anita. They aren’t morals if you throw them aside every time it’s convenient.
 - Nothing is more appealing than a handsome man who is also uncertain of himself.
 - There had to be a circle of Hell where you were eternally fourteen, eternally in junior high. One of the lower circles.
 - Somehow I think Trophy Wives wear more makeup and less cutlery. But hey, I haven’t ever met a Trophy Wife, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe they know what I know, that the true way to a man’s heart is six inches of metal between his ribs.
 - Lust has less logic than love, sometimes, but it’s easier to fight.
 - I give good advice. I do not always take it.
 - Graves are for the living, not the dead. It gives us something to concentrate on instead of the fact that our loved one is rotting under the ground.
 - Personally, I think neutral is just another way of saving your own ass at the expense of someone else’s.
 - Life is often like that, the best balancing on a knife edge with the worst.
 - She doesn’t understand what she’s asking, Jean-Claude said. No, but she asks, and if we do not do it, we will always wonder. I would rather thy and fail than regret having never tried at all.
 - Zerbrowski said, “Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.” It took me a second to realize that he had just quoted Star Wars to me. It made me smile, and in that moment I loved him, just for that.
 - Without hope, love dies and parts of you wither.
 - I was shaking all over, and it wasn’t from the vampire. Memories have teeth, too.
 - You may be a manipulative bastard sometimes, but you are our manipulative bastard.
 - In chains and darkness, wherefore should I stay, And mourn in prison, while I keep the key.
 - Edward’s grief if you die will be a terrible thing. It will hurt him, a lot, and men like him never grieve alone. He will spread his grief all over us, not because we failed, but because it’ll give him something to focus on so he doesn’t have to feel the pain.
 - I would rather you love me, but if not love, fear will do.
 - Besides I’m a sucker for a pair of pretty eyes.
 - Sometimes the monsters are real, Anita. Sometimes they’re real and the only way to defeat them is to be the bigger monster.? – Chang Bibi to Anita.
 - You either mellow at 30, or your head explodes – take your choice.
 - I wasn’t crying, my eyes were running. My eyes were running because there were pieces of zombies all over my toys. Jesus.
 - There are a thousand ways to hurt someone you love that have nothing to do with physical violence.
 - The only good enemy is a dead enemy.
 - A vampire victim. I’d never seen a lone kill. They were like potato chips; once a vamp tasted them, he couldn’t stop at just one.

 - When you spend all your time worrying that the devil is right behind you, eventually you start seeing him whether he’s there or not.
 - No, really, Ronnie, it’s good to share information when you know someone else is dating the lunarly challenged.
 - Not knowing a thing is not ignorance. Feigning knowledge you don’t have can be – Sholto.
 - I know the universe has a sense of irony, and sometimes you get reminded just how sadistic that can be.
 - People talk of sorrow as if it is soft, a thing of water and tears. But true sorrow is not soft. True sorrow is a thing of fire, and rock. It burns your heart, crushes your soul under the weight of mountains. It destroys, and even if you keep breathing, keep going, you die.
 - Everyone wants to grow up to be a faerie princess. Trust me, It’s overrated.
 - Questions are great, but only if you know the answers. If you ask questions and the answers surprise you, you look silly.
 - Every ruler should strive for his people to love him. But if they cannot love you, then make them fear you. Love is better, but fear will do the job.
 - Mercy will get you killed, but sometimes it’s all that makes us human.
 - Personally I didn’t believe God had a private torture chamber. Hell was being cut off from God, cut off from his power, his energy, Him.

 - If you’re alive, don’t move, if you’re dead, don’t worry about it.
 - Surely being in love doesn’t cause you to lose your sense of good taste. If I ever buy a gown with sequins on it, someone just shoot me.
 - My writing style is very sensual, as in sensory detail.
 - Everyone has their weaknesses. Some people smoke. I collect stuffed penguins. If you won’t tell, I won’t.
 - I worry that when you start quoting Machiavelli to justify your actions, you have ceased to be one of the good guys. No, quoting Nietzsche does that. Machiavelli is just cool.
 - If your life works, and you work in it, then it’s okay, whatever is happening is okay.
 - Oh, no, a leopard blew up and plastered itself all over everything, but hey, animal print was in this year.
 - Never look back; something is always gaining on you.

 - Chastity works better if you don’t keep testing it.
 - You smell of other peoples blood, ma petite. It was no one you know. -Jean Claude and Anita.
 - Out last chance is a cat’s magic sight. We are doomed.

 - You fight so hard, so long, to cut someone out of your heart, but it’s not always your heart that betrays you.
 - Never throw stones if you think they’re going to come back and hit you.
 - Most hatred is based on fear, one way or another. Yeah. I wrapped myself in anger, with a dash of hate, and at the bottom of it all was an icy center of pure terror.
 - How do you introduce boyfriend C to boyfriend A after boyfriend A has been such a good sport, of late, about boyfriend B, who is no longer in the picture?
 - Just what I needed – a necromancer with an attitude. Oh, wait, I was a necromancer with an attitude.
 - The ratman froze, staring at me. “Why are you laughing?” His voice held just a hint of unease. Good. I was hoping that the vampires would come for me soon and save me. You’ve got to admit that’s funny.
 - I talk to myself everyone once in a while. Give myself very good advice. Sometimes I even take it.
 - Regrets are about decisions that you know you should have done different.
 - I should not have to flirt with someone while I’m trying to threaten someone else with a gun; it was too hard to do both.
 - So many of us had been armed that there were holsters and weapons scattered among the passed-out bodies like mercenary prizes in a fleshy Cracker Jack box.
 - If you think love makes you happy, you’ve either never been in love, or never been in love long enough to have to start compromising.
 - To know another’s heart, you must first know your own.
 - Only those who have never known fear are allowed to think less of others for being afraid. Frankly, I think anyone who has never been afraid of anything in their entire life is either a liar or lacks imagination.
 - I am a very linear thinker, so I write beginning to end. I write hundreds of pages per book that never make it into print.
 - What we prefer to read is sort of like sexual preference, you like what you like. Most of the time you have no clue why.
 - Nill illigitamus carborundum.
 - I knew from the moment I heard you, the moment I saw the gun and realized that this lovely, petit woman was the executioner, that you would never die waiting for me to save you – that you would save yourself.
 - What is it about her that is so goddamned special?
 - There are only two kinds of vampire hunters: good ones and dead ones.
 - My right hand was sort of casually near my gun, without looking like I was reaching for my gun. It wasn’t easy. Reaching for a gun usually looks like reaching for a gun. No one seemed to notice though. Goody for our side.
 - Children make that big a difference to you? He asked. I nodded. Yeah, they do. I never figured you as the maternal type. I’m not, but kids are people, Edward, little people trapped by the choices the adults around them make.
 - Once upon a time wasn’t as long ago as it used to be.
 - I’d have much rather gotten dragged into someone else’s fight than face what was waiting for me. Other people’s emotional pain, no matter how painful, is so much less painful than your own.
 - I am the Executioner. Murder someone in my town, and I’m the one that you get to see. Once.
 - Vampires can live a very long time, theoretically forever, which means their idea of getting down to business can be damn leisurely.
 - One of my favorite things about hanging out with the monsters is the healing. Straight humans seemed to get killed on me a lot. Monsters survived. Let’s hear it for the monsters.
 - Never argue when you’re winning.

 - I know who and what I am. I am the Executioner, and I don’t date vampires. I kill them.
 - Twenty-three stories up and all I could see out the windows was grey smog. They could call it the City of the Angels if they wanted to, but if there were angels out there, they had to be flying blind.
 - Ma petite is not a subtle woman. Unless you say it, she will not understand it.
 - One of the many reasons that Padma will always be a secondary power on the Council is his belief that all power must be taken, that all power must come through fear. True power comes when others offer it to you and you merely accept it as a gift, not as the spoils of some personal war.

 - All men love to talk about themselves, even the ones who are completely buggers.
 - Sticks and stones will break your bones, but failure will get you killed.

 - It is a very natural human trait to destroy that which frightens us.
 - Self-doubt is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
 - I’ve lost track of the number of people who want to be writers but never actually write anything. Talking about writing, dreaming about writing, can be very fun, but it won’t get a book written. You’ve got to write.
 - In real life I do violence, but for psychic stuff I do other things better.
 - It has been my experience that women tell more intimate details to their friends than men do. Men may brag more, but women will talk the nitty-gritty and share the experience more.
 - Zebrowski says that if you killed someone else just hide the body, he’s not starting over on the paperwork.
 - I sounded like Horton the Elephant. “A person is a person no matter how small.” What the hell was I doing standing in the middle of a cave, in the dark, surrounded by wererats, quoting Dr. Seuss, and trying to kill a one-thousand-year-old vampire?
 - Death cures all ills. Well, most of them.
 - Compromise is an imperfect act.
 - Now that I’m being very successful, publishers are trying to mainstream me, but I’m unabashedly genre. It’s what I like to read, what I like to write.
 - A little boy who’s discovered the monster under the bed is actually real, and it’s screwing Mommy.
 - To just let go, and not pick everything to death. To just let go and enjoy what you had. To just let go and not make everybody around you miserable with your own internal dialogue. To just let go and be happy. So simple. So difficult. So terrifying.
 - I, Anita Blake, scourge of the undead-the human with more vampire kills than any other vampire executioner in the country-was dating a vampire. It was poetically ironic.
 - It’s good not to be the only girl in the fight for once.
 - I think that my vampires in general were influenced by my being allowed to watch the Hammer vampire films. Vampire Circus, also shown as Circus of Fear, was one of those movies.

 - What happens in Vegas may stay in Vegas, but what happens in New Orleans, goes home with you.
 - Heroes don’t get anything but dead.

 - Human lives are too short to waste in trivialities.
 - I wondered if I had offended him. I wondered if I cared.
 - I hate women who complain about being fat when they’re like a size 5. Anything under size 5 isn’t a woman. It’s a boy with breasts.

 - Anyone who doesn’t believe that the forest is a deadly place has never been lost in one.
 - An atheist waving a cross at a vampire was a truly pitiful sight.
 - Is it better to outmonster the monsters or to be quietly devoured?

 - Anyone who tells you size doesn’t matter has been seeing too many small knives.
 - I spent the next fifteen minutes convincing a crying werewolf that I wasn’t going to hurt her. My life was getting too strange, even for me.
 - Edward smiled, I smiled, even Bernardo smiled. Olaf just looked sinister.
 - That was the true terror of love, that you could love with your whole heart, your whole soul, and lose both.
 - He looked less handsome without the smile and glow in his eyes, but he also seemed more real. Being real will get me into trouble faster than any amount of charm.

 - If I’d been easily discouraged, I could have been a one-hit wonder.
 - Sometimes love isn’t about being smart. Sometimes it’s about being stupid together.
 - Perfection is an unattainable goal. It isn’t going to be perfect. Just get words down on paper, and when you stumble to what you think is the end of the book, you will have hundreds of pages of words that came out of your head. It may not be perfect, but it looks like a book.
 - Richard was a riddle with no answer, and I was tired of playing a game I couldn’t win.
 - I knew what was like to finally be seduced by the thing you hunted. Mine just happened to be a more traditional seduction. Okay, at least I was still among the living.
 - Silk didn’t care if it slid over scars or smooth, untouched skin. I’d earned my right to be paranoid.

 - Most hatred is based on fear, one way or another.
 - I don’t have a master. I’m not sure if I have an equal.

 - What is love? Sometimes it’s just letting yourself be who and what you are, and letting the person you’re supposed to love be who and what he is too. Or maybe what and who they are.
 - Important safety tip – never look a vampire in the eye.

 - I wanted to say something brilliant. My God, Holmes, how did you know the zombie was hiding in the flower pot? But I couldn’t lie.

 - We aren’t the good guys, Anita. We’re the necessary guys. -Edward.
 - The Catholic Church sees voluntary vampirism as a kind of suicide. I tend to agree. Though the Pope also excommunicated all animators, unless we ceased raising the dead. Fine; I became Episcopalian.
 - I just don’t believe in helping people who are going to torture me. Though I don’t see any bamboo slivers. How can you possibly torture someone without bamboo slivers?

 - I’d never met coffee that wasn’t wonderful. It was just a matter of how wonderful it was.
 - I didn’t want to understand. Bert had been thrilled that the police wanted to put me on retainer. He told me I would gain valuable experience working with the police. All I had gained so far was a wider variety of nightmares.
 - You did not bring down two of the royal guard in an unceremonious heap because the woman in the middle tripped.

 - Assuming the worst was always safer. And usually truer.
 - Never argue with your characters; they know themselves better than you do.
