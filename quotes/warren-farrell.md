 - Only when a woman shares male risks can she really begin to understand men.
 - Women’s liberation and the male midlife crisis were the same search – for personal fulfillment, common values, mutual respect, love. But while women’s liberation was thought of as promoting identity, the male midlife crisis was thought of as an identity crisis.

 - In fact, the socialization gives us the tools to fill our evolutionary roles. They are our building blocks.

 - Until recently, the question was ‘Why can’t a woman be more like a man?’ It should have been changed to ‘Why can’t both sexes be more like the best parts of each other?’ Instead, the pendulum swung to the 1960s feminist lapel button Adam Was a First Draft. True enough. So are we all.
