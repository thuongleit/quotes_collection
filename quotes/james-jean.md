 - The universe begins to look more like a great thought than a great machine.
 - I could be mistaken, but I believe the majority of artists are perverts, and that inspiration springs from the seat of perversity; that smooth stretch of consciousness between the balls and ass.
 - To-day, to-day, be wise, be wise.
