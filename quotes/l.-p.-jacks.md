 - A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between work and play.
 - The mechanical mind has a passion for control – of everything except itself.
 - Spirit is matter seen in a stronger light.
 - Our intellectual development in the field of science has outstripped our human development in the field of character.
 - No one will know what you mean by saying that ‘God is love’ unless you act it as well.
 - The mechanical mind has a passion for control – of everything except itself. Beyond the control it has won over the forces of nature it would now win control over the forces of society of stating the problem and producing the solution, with social machinery to correspond.
 - Faith is nothing else than reason grown courageous – reason raised to its highest power, expanded to its widest vision.
