 - I dont really ever compare myself to other people, I dont even measure myself in terms of anyone but myself.
 - I write about what I know: sex, pornography, art, fame obsession, drugs, and alcohol. I mean, why would anyone care to listen to me if I wasn’t an expert in what I write about?
 - I’m already crazy. I’m a fearless person. I think it creeps up on you. I don’t think it can be stopped. If my destiny is to lose my mind because of fame, then that’s my destiny. But my passion still means more than anything.

 - I work very hard, but when God opens that door for you – when life opens that door for you, I should say – I think it’s important to be giving, to return the love back.

 - I’m telling you a lie in a vicious effort that you will repeat my lie over and over until it becomes true.

 - I’m single right now and I’ve chosen to be single because I don’t have the time to get to know anybody. So it’s okay not to have sex, it’s okay to get to know people. I’m celibate. Celibacy’s fine.
 - You are equally important to me, and I love you all.
 - A glamorous life is quite different to a life of luxury. I don’t need luxury. For years, I was practically broke but I was still very vain and glamorous. And I still am.

 - Making ziti for the Chicago Fire Department! I hope they’re not too busy today, but this should fill their bellies I hope they like it!
 - I don’t want to be remembered as anything but brave. The only good intention to make money is to help others. I want to be Oprah. I want to be Melinda Gates. If I ever sell products other than my talents, then it will be to give more to others.
 - Prejudice is a disease. And when they come for you, or refuse your worth, I will be ready for their stones. I belong to you.
 - I see love in black and white. Passion in shades of “gris”. But when it comes to you and I, color is all I see.
 - My friends joke that I’m dead until I get onstage. I’m dead right now as you’re speaking to me.

 - Be inspired to ignore their ignorant message, and feel gratitude in your heart that you are not burdened or addicted to hate, as they are.

 - In the book of Gaga, fame is in your heart, fame is there to comfort you, to bring you self-confidence and worth whenever you need it.
 - I’m inspired by fashion. I’m inspired by the moonlight. I’m inspired by sex and pornography and slasher films.

 - Being gay is like glitter, it never goes away.
 - I was doing these performance art pop music pieces in the city. And they were a bit on the eccentric side I suppose. So people started to call me Gaga after the Queen song ‘Radio Gaga.’
 - I don’t dress any particular way to impress anyone or market myself for my music. It’s actually who I am.
 - I think that promoting insecurity in the form of plastic surgery is infinitely more harmful than an artistic expression related to body modification.

 - I’m a little bit naked, but that’s okay.
 - People that are obsessed with hating you, feel flattered. Their whole lives revolve around you.
 - Music and visual performance have to influence each other. Designers and musicians have to be the nexus of all things pop culture, so I think about designers when I’m making music.

 - Let the blood and the bruises define your legacy.
 - Some artists want your money so they can buy Range Rovers and diamond bracelets, but I don’t care about that kind of stuff. I want your soul.
 - I can’t even drive a car. I don’t have a driver’s license. I have a rented apartment in New York. That’s it. When I travel, I have almost all of my possessions with me. That’s how little I own.
 - Look to yourself for the answer – stop calling your girlfriends and stop calling your mom – you know if it’s working or not, you either feel like a goddess or you don’t.
 - And now, I’m just trying to change the world, one sequin at a time.
 - I feel the denial of gay marriage sends a prejudice message. Our youth deserve a fair and hopeful future with government that values us equally.
 - I find it so important now to be a role model and a figure. And I know that may sound strange to some people, but most important is my connection with my fans and the connection that they breed with one another.

 - I’m a single girl. I like to have a good time. I just sleep with the guys in the band all the time because it’s easier.
 - Basically I can’t sleep without every single song I’m writing repeating endlessly, but I’m loving it again. Embracing the torture, as I’m assaulted by my own thoughts. Like a locust giving birth to earworms. Eeeeew!
 - My grandmother is basically blind, but she can make out the lighter parts, like my skin and hair. She says, ‘I can see you, because you have no pants on.’ So I’ll continue to wear no pants so that my grandma can see me.
 - I used to get made fun of for being either too provocative or too eccentric, so I started to tone it down. I didn’t fit in, and I felt like a freak.
 - If I could for a moment just inspire you to love yourself, that would be worth EVERYTHING.
 - Everyone can access the parts of themselves that are great. I’m just a girl from New York City who decided to do this, after all. Rule the world! What’s life worth living if you don’t rule it?
 - I have been addicted to it, and it’s ultimately related to anxiety coping, and it’s a form of self-medication, and I was smoking up to 15 to 20 marijuana cigarettes a day with no tobacco.
 - I’m not a sandwich store that only sells turkey sandwiches. I sell a lot of different things.
 - Because the sweeter the cake, the more bitter the jelly can be.
 - Glam culture is ultimately rooted in obsession, and those of us who are truly devoted and loyal to the lifestyle of glamour are masters of its history. Or, to put it more elegantly, we are librarians.

 - I don’t care about money.
 - I want women – and men – to feel empowered by a deeper and more psychotic part of themselves. The part they’re always trying desperately to hide. I want that to become something that they cherish.

 - My new album that I’m creating, which is finished pretty much, was written with this new instinctual energy that I’ve developed getting to know my fans. They protect me, so now it’s my destiny to protect them.
 - No press, no television. If my mom calls and says, ‘Did you hear about?’ I don’t want to know nothing about anything that is going on in relation to music. I shut it all off.
 - People want to tear me down, they were going to knife me anyway.

 - When you’re around me and really see that all I do is live and breathe for my work, it’s not strange, it’s just Gaga.
 - I don’t think that women need to smell interesting.
 - My records are borderline dance records. They’ve got a real electro-rock heart and soul, and the vibe of the sentiment is pop, but there’s a lot of people that were like, ‘This is a dance record.’
