 - Music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music.
 - My dear hands. Farewell, my poor hands.
 - What is Music? How do you define it? Music is a calm moonlit night, the rustle of leaves in Summer. Music is the far off peal of bells at dusk! Music comes straight from the heart and talks only to the heart: it is Love! Music is the Sister of Poetry and her Mother is sorrow!
 - I compose music because I must give expression to my feelings, just as I talk because I must give utterance to my thoughts.
 - I feel like a ghost wandering in a world grown alien. I cannot cast out the old way of writing and I cannot acquire the new. I have made an intense effort to feel the musical manner of today, but it will not come to me.
 - The new kind of music seems to create not from the heart but from the head. Its composers think rather than feel. They have not the capacity to make their works exalt â€“ they meditate, protest, analyze, reason, calculate and brood, but they do not exalt.
 - A good conductor ought to be a good chauffeur; the qualities that make the one also make the other. They are concentration, an incessant control of attention, and presence of mind; the conductor only has to add a little sense of music.
 - The most efficient way to memorise a piece is to use the one which proceeds in an error free manner.
 - The virtuosos look to the students of the world to do their share in the education of the great musical public. Do not waste your time with music that is trite or ignoble. Life is too short to spend it wandering in the barren Saharas of musical trash.
