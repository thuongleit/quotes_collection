 - Educated fools; from uneducated schools.
 - Remember your dream is your only scheme, so keep on pushing.
 - Move on up towards your destination.
 - His hustle was wrong, his mind was his own, but the man lived alone, oh, Superfly.
 - Sisters, brothers and the whities, Blacks and the crackers, Police and their backers, They’re all political actors.
 - Maybe the words that I say is just another way to pray.
 - Don’t worry, if there is a hell below, we’re all going to go.
 - The hunt is on and brother you’re the prey.
 - Our purpose is to educate as well as to entertain.
