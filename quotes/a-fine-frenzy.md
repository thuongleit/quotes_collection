 - Goodbye my almost lover, goodbye my hopeless dream, I’m tryin not to think about you, Can’t you just let me be? So long, my luckless romance, my back is turned on you, should’ve known you’d bring me heartbreak, almost lovers always do.
 - So you’re gone and i’m haunted And i bet you are just fine Did i make it that easy to walk Right in and out of my life.
 - Is there a chance? A fragment of light at the end of the tunnel? A reason to fight? Is there a chance you may change your mind? Or are we ashes and wine?
