 - Reagan proved deficits don’t matter.
 - Principle is OK up to a certain point, but principle doesn’t do any good if you lose.
 - Everyone knows that you’re not really a real man unless you own a gun.

 - It will be necessary for us to be a nation of men, and not laws.
 - If you’re going to go increase taxes on small businesses, you’re going to slow down the extent to which we’re able to reduce unemployment. So I think it’s a serious mistake; the wrong time to raise taxes.
 - Whoever controls the flow of Persian Gulf oil has a stranglehold not only on our economy but also on the other countries of the world as well.
 - Unfortunately, we don’t have the option of marriage in our country. We could go to Britain or Spain or Argentina and do something symbolic, but that’s not what I want. I want to have the rights of anybody else in my home country. I don’t want to be a second-class citizen.

 - I think you can not be blown off course by the fluctuations in the public opinion polls.

 - Conservation may be a sign of personal virtue, but it is not a sufficient basis for a sound, comprehensive energy policy.
 - I think we need a very, very serious effort, primarily through tax policy to provide incentives and encouragement for people to save and invest and expand their businesses and to create more jobs. The kind of thing we did in the early Reagan years, 30 years ago. I think that’s essential.
 - I can’t think of a time when we’ve had a region emerge as suddenly to become as strategically significant as the Caspian.
 - The good Lord didn’t see fit to put oil and gas only where there are democratically elected regimes friendly to the United States. Occasionally we have to operate in places where, all considered, one would not normally choose to go. But we go where the business is.
 - We have great information. They’re going to welcome us. It’ll be like the American Army going through the streets of Paris. They’re sitting there ready to form a new government. The people will be so happy with their freedoms that we’ll probably back ourselves out of there within a month or two.
 - I mean, it’s not just one day you get up, bang, and you got Osama bin Laden. It’s the kind of thing where an awful lot of people over a long period of time – thousands have worked this case and these issues and followed on the leads and captured bad guys and interrogated them and so-forth.
