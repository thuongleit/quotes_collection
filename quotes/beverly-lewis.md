 - Courage is fear on its knees.
 - This is what reading is like to me. It’s finding a spring in the midst of a barren land. Just when I think I might up and die of thirst, I stumble onto this fresh, cold water, and I’m suddenly given this new life because I can-and do-drink to my heart’s content.
 - Yet it seems to me finishing well in this life is not so much about who is the best or greatest at something, but rather who embraces lowliness of heart. Laying down one’s rights- meekness- is a blessed virtue, one that must surely come straight from the Throne of Grace.
 - Books are like friends to me. Words come alive on the page.
 - The tarter the apple, the tastier the cider.
 - Happiness isn’t wanting what you can get, but wanting what you have.
