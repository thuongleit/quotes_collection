 - Training can get on a manâ€™s nerves. There is no profit or use in denying it.
 - Of all athletic forms, running is perhaps the most taxing and the most exciting; that is, when carried to the extreme.
 - The less serious running of any description which an athlete indulges in before eighteen, the better for his future prospects.
