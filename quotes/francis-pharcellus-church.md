 - Yes Virginia, There is a Santa Claus.
 - No Santa Claus! Thank God! he lives, and he lives forever. A thousand years from now, Virginia, nay, ten times ten thousand years from now, he will continue to make glad the heart of childhood.
 - Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus. He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist.
 - You may tear apart the baby’s rattle and see what makes the noise inside, but there is a veil covering the unseen world which not the strongest man, nor even the united strength of all the strongest men that ever lived, could tear apart.
 - Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.
 - The most real things in the world are those that neither children nor men can see. Did you ever see fairies dancing on the lawn? Of course not, but that’s no proof that they are not there. Nobody can conceive or imagine all the wonders there are unseen and unseeable in the world.
 - Not believe in Santa Claus! You might as well not believe in fairies!
