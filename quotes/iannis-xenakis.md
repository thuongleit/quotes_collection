 - Do you realize that we’re meteorites; almost as soon as we’re born, we have to disappear?
 - Music is not a language. Any musical piece is akin to a boulder with complex forms, with striations and engraved designs atop and within, which men can decipher in a thousand different ways without ever finding the right answer or the best one...
