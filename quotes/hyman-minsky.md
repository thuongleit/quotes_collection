 - Stability leads to instability. The more stable things become and the longer things are stable, the more unstable they will be when the crisis hits.
 - Success breeds a disregard of the possibility of failure.
 - Unless we understand what it is that leads to economic and financial instability, we cannot prescribe – make policy – to modify or eliminate it. Identifying a phenomenon is not enough; we need a theory that makes instability a normal result in our economy and gives us handles to control it.
 - If the authorities constrain banks and are aware of the activities of fringe banks and other financial institutions, they are in a better position to attenuate the disruptive expansionary tendencies of our economy.
