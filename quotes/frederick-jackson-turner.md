 - Up to our own day American history has been in a large degree the history of the colonization of the Great West. The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.
 - The frontier has gone, and with its going has closed the first period of American history.
 - America has been another name for opportunity.
 - So long as free land exists, the opportunity for a competency exists, and economic power secures political power.
 - Each age tries to form its own conception of the past. Each age writes the history of the past anew with reference to the conditions uppermost in its own time.
