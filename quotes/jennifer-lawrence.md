 - A bad word that I can’t say that starts with f.

 - Why can’t we just be nice? It’s like, we grow up, and then we get right back into high school.

 - In Hollywood, I’m obese. I’m considered a fat actress. I eat like a caveman. I’ll be the only actress who doesn’t have anorexia rumours! I’m never going to starve myself for a part. I’m invincible. I don’t want little girls to be like, “Oh, I want to look like Katniss, so I’m going to skip dinner.”
 - As soon as somebody farts around me, I think it’s hilarious. This is something my brothers did that now the boys at work are obsessed with. You cup it, and then you throw it in someone’s face and say, ‘Take a bite out of that cheeseburger!’
 - I’ve done archery for about six weeks, and rock climbing, tree climbing – and combat, running and vaulting. But also yoga and things like that, to stay catlike!

 - My breasts have a life of their own.
 - Why can’t I say anything normal?

 - If you are going to do something that you have to lie about, don’t do it, it’s very simple.

 - I’m dead sober. This is just me.

 - I eat like a caveman.
 - Seeing what is wrong and how it could be made right propels us into action, but in that action we often leave other people behind and don’t give ourselves enough time to be present, or to stop and reflect. Leaders have to get comfortable with pausing in that uncomfortable gap.

 - I’m doing what I love, and then I get months and months of rest. I have a lot of money for a 21-year old. I can’t stand it when actors complain.

 - If a woman is determined, she will get what she wants because we are very determined creatures.
 - I think the biggest reason that actors are complete a-holes as soon as they become famous is because they forget that this a job. They think that it’s about them, and it’s not.
 - I really love acting. I really do. I really just think of myself like a working woman. And I just go from set to set and work. You have to promote a movie; you have to work. People are going to have opinions and it’s weirdly very easy to kind of block out the world because you have your own.

 - This is hilarious. First, people say how so many actresses in Hollywood look anorexic, and now they are criticizing me for looking normal. Body images are too often adopted by young girls and women – thanks to what they are constantly being shown as being attractive.
 - Acting, films, scripts, is literally the only thing I’m 100 percent confident in. I know what I’m doing. I just understand it, and I love it. When I’m on set, that’s when I feel the most at home and in control.

 - Sometimes if a script is based on a book, that’s what you should do: represent the book.
