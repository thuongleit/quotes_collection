 - We must enhance the light, not fight the darkness.
 - The soul should be examined in the light of other souls.
 - A false idea is not only one which is absolutely subjective but one which is absolutely objective.
 - The soul of the slave, the soul of the “little man,” is as dear to me as the soul of the great.
