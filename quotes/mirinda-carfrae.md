 - I always get asked how fast I can run and the answer is ‘faster.’
 - Most days, I’m out there, I’m enjoying what I’m doing. I love my job, I love my life, some days I get up, I’m sore, I’m on the edge of getting sick, I’m like, just beat up, and I don’t want to go out. I just kind of make myself go out there and do it.
