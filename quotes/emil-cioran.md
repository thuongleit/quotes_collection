 - By virtue of depression, we recall those misdeeds we buried in the depths of our memory. Depression exhumes our shames.
 - Every profound dissatisfaction is of a religious nature: our failures derive from our incapacity to conceive of paradise and to aspire to it, as our discomforts from the fragility of our relations with the absolute.
 - All people see fires, storms, explosions, or landscapes; but how many feel the flames, the lightnings, the whirlwinds, or the harmony? How many have an inner beauty that tinges their melancholy?

 - Chaos is rejecting all you have learned, chaos is being yourself.
 - For you who no longer possess it, freedom is everything, for us who do, it is merely an illusion.

 - We have lost, being born, as much as we shall lose dying: Everything!
 - Intelligence flourishes only in the ages when belief withers.
