 - This is my doctrine: Give every other human being every right you claim for yourself.
 - The hands that help are better far than lips that pray.
 - A good deed is the best prayer.
 - Happiness is the only good. The time to be happy is now. The place to be happy is here. The way to be happy is to make others so.
 - A believer is a bird in a cage, a freethinker is an eagle parting the clouds with tireless wing.
 - He loves his country best who strives to make it best.
 - As more people become more intelligent they care less for preachers and more for teachers.
 - All religion is slavery.
 - Blasphemy is what an old dogma screams at a new truth.
 - The myth of hell represents all the meanness, all the revenge, all the selfishness, all the cruelty, all the hatred, all the infamy of which the heart of man is capable.
 - I will not attack your doctrines nor your creeds if they accord liberty to me. If they hold thought to be dangerous – if they aver that doubt is a crime, then I attack them one and all, because they enslave the minds of men.
 - Labor is the only prayer that Nature answers: It is the only prayer that deserves an answer – good, honest, noble work.
 - Religion supports nobody. It has to be supported. It produces no wheat, no corn; it ploughs no land; it fells no forests. It is a perpetual mendicant. It lives on the labors of others, and then has the arrogance to pretend that it supports the giver.
 - The way to be happy is to make others so.
 - Meekness is the mask of malice.
 - Infidels in all ages have battled for the rights of man, and have at all times been the fearless advocates of liberty and justice.
 - Above all things, one should maintain his self-respect, and there is but one way to do that, and that is to live in accordance with your highest ideal.
 - An infinite God ought to be able to protect Himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures.
 - Progress is born of doubt and inquiry. The Church never doubts, never inquires. To doubt is heresy, to inquire is to admit that you do not know – the Church does neither.
 - All religious systems enslave the mind. Certain things are demanded-certain things must be believed-certain things must be done-and the man who becomes the subject or servant of this superstition must give up all idea of indivuality or hope of intellectual growth or progress.
 - I would rather be a beggar and spend my money like a king, than be a king and spend money like a beggar.
 - Character survives; goodness lives; love is immortal.
 - The God of hell should be held in loathing, contempt and scorn. A god who threatens eternal pain should be hated, not loved; cursed, not worshipped. A heaven presided over by such a god must be below the meanest hell.
 - In the night of death, hope sees a star, and listening love can hear the rustle of a wing.
 - Blasphemy is an epithet bestowed by superstition upon common sense.
 - Commerce is the great civilizer.
 - Mental slavery is mental death, and every man who has given up his intellectual freedom is the living coffin of his dead soul.
 - The greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart.
 - Too much doubt is better than too much credulity.
 - With soap, baptism is a good thing.
 - If a man wishes to have God recognized in the constitution of our country, let him read the history of the Inquisition, and let him remember that hundreds of millions of men, women, and children have been sacrificed to placate the wrath, or win the approbation of this god.
 - The Church says the Earth is flat. But I know that it is round. For I have seen the shadow on the Moon. And I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church.
 - The clergy know that I know that they know that they do not know.
 - The more a man knows, the more willing he is to learn-the less a man knows, the more positive he is that he knows everything.
 - Science built the Academy, superstition the Inquisition.
 - Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know what a man really is, give him power.
 - Colleges are places where pebbles are polished and diamonds are dimmed.
 - Nothing discloses character like the use of power.
 - Let us account for all we see by the facts we know. If there are things for which we cannot account, let us wait for light. To account for anything by supernatural agencies is, in fact to say that we do not know. Theology is not what we know about God, but what we do not know about Nature.
 - To the wise man, to the wise nation, the mistakes of the past are the torches of the present.
 - In the republic of mediocrity, genius is dangerous.
 - Christianity did not come with tidings of great joy, but with a message of eternal grief. It came with the threat of everlasting torture on its lips. It meant war on earth and perdition hereafter.
 - By nature all people are alike, but by education become different.
 - I admit that reason is a small and feeble flame, a flickering torch by stumblers carried in the star-less night, – blown and flared by passion’s storm, – and yet, it is the only light. Extinguish that, and nought remains.
 - Civilization has gotten further and further from the so-called ‘natural’ man, who uses all his faculties: perception, invention, improvisation.
 - It is a thousand times better to have common sense without education than to have education without common sense.
 - If I go to heaven I want to take my reason with me.
 - But honest men do not pretend to know; they are candid and sincere; they love the truth; they admit their ignorance, and they say, We do not know.
 - In all ages the people have honored those who dishonored them. They have worshiped their destroyers; they have canonized the most gigantic liars, and buried the great thieves in marble and gold. Under the loftiest monuments sleeps the dust of murder.
 - In our era, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.
 - Let us put theology out of religion. Theology has always sent the worst to heaven, the best to hell.
 - Arguments cannot be answered by personal abuse; there is no logic in slander, and falsehood, in the long run, defeats itself.
 - We can be as honest as we are ignorant. If we are, when asked what is beyond the horizon of the known, we must say that we do not know.
 - The history of the world shows that when a mean thing was done, man did it; when a good thing was done, man did it.
 - Intelligence is the only moral guide.
 - Everyone should be taught the nobility of labor, the heroism and splendor of honest effort. As long as it is considered disgraceful to labor, or aristocratic not to labor, the world will be filled with idleness and crime, and with every possible moral deformity.
 - It is hard for many people to give up the religion in which they were born; to admit that their fathers were utterly mistaken, and that the sacred records of their country are but collections of myths and fables.
 - Every creed is a rock in running water: humanity sweeps by it. Every creed cries to the universe, “Halt!” A creed is the ignorant Past bulling the enlightened Present.
 - Christianity has made more lunatics than it ever provided asylums for.
 - Give me the storm and tempest of thought and action, rather than the dead calm of ignorance and faith! Banish me from Eden when you will; but first let me eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge!
 - Every man who expresses an honest thought is a soldier in the army of intellectual liberty.
 - Hope is the only bee that makes honey without flowers.
 - If a man would follow, today, the teachings of the Old Testament, he would be a criminal. If he would follow strictly the teachings of the New, he would be insane.
 - This, in my judgment, is the highest philosophy: First, do not regret having lost yesterday; second, do not fear that you will lose tomorrow; third, enjoy today.
 - Why should we postpone our joy to another world? Let us get all we can of the good between the cradle and the grave, all that we can of the truly dramatic. If, when death comes, that is the end, we have at least made the best of this life.
 - And yet this same Deity says to me, resist not evil; pray for those that despitefully use you; love your enemies, but I will eternally damn mine. It seems to me that even gods should practice what they preach.
 - Fear is religion, courage is science.
 - The savage prays to a stone that he calls a god, while the Christian prays to a god he calls a spirit, and the prayers of both are equally useful.
 - Anger is a wind which blows out the lamp of the mind.
 - The superior man is the providence of the inferior. He is eyes for the blind, strength for the weak, and a shield for the defenseless. He stands erect by bending above the fallen. He rises by lifting others.

 - Every cradle asks us, Whence? and every coffin, Whither? The poor barbarian, weeping above his dead, can answer these questions as intelligently as the robed priest of the most authentic creed.
 - Injustice upon earth renders the justice of of heaven impossible.
 - The book, called the Bible, is filled with passages equally horrible, unjust and atrocious. This is the book to be read in schools in order to make our children loving, kind and gentle! This is the book they wish to be recognized in our Constitution as the source of all authority and justice!
 - Hope is the only universal liar who never loses his reputation for veracity.
 - Justice, poised and balanced in eternal calm, will shake from the golden scales in which are weighed the acts of men, the very dust of prejudice and caste: No race, no color, no previous condition, can change the rights of men.
 - When the will defies fear, when duty throws the gauntlet down to fate, when honor scorns to compromise with death – that is heroism.
 - There is no slavery but ignorance.
 - Belief is not a matter of choice, but of conviction.
 - Nothing is greater than to break the chains from the bodies of men – nothing nobler than to destroy the phantom of the soul.
 - Every man is dishonest who lives upon the labor of others, no matter if he occupies a throne.
 - A mortgage casts a shadow on the sunniest field.
 - They knew that it was necessary to believe these things and to love God. They knew that there could be no salvation except by faith, and through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.
 - The Christians say, that among the ancient Jews, if you committed a crime you had to kill a sheep. Now they say ‘charge it.’ ‘Put it on the slate.’ The Savior will pay it. In this way, rascality is sold on credit, and the credit system in morals, as in business, breeds extravagance.
 - God so loved the world that he made up his mind to damn a large majority of the human race.
 - If the people were a little more ignorant, astrology would flourish – if a little more enlightened, religion would perish.

 - Strange but true: those who have loved God most have loved men least.
 - I will follow my logic, no matter where it goes, after it has consulted with my heart. If you ever come to a conclusion without calling the heart in, you will come to a bad conclusion.
 - All religions are inconsistent with mental freedom. Shakespeare is my bible, Burns my hymn-book.
 - The triumph of justice is the only peace.
 - Every pulpit is a pillory, in which stands a hired culprit, defending the justice of his own imprisonment.
 - In the presence of death I affirm and reaffirm the truth of all that I have said against the superstitions of the world. I would say that much on the subject with my last breath.
 - There is something wrong in a government where they who do the most have the least. There is something wrong when honesty wears a rag, and rascality a robe; when the loving, the tender, east a crust, while the infamous sit at banquets.
 - In all ages, hypocrites, called priests, have put crowns upon the heads of thieves, called kings.
 - Great virtues may draw attention from defects, they cannot sanctify them. A pebble surrounded by diamonds remains a common stone, and a diamond surrounded by pebbles is still a gem.
 - A fact never went into partnership with a miracle. Truth scorns the assistance of wonders. A fact will fit every other fact in the universe, and that is how you can tell whether it is or is not a fact. A lie will not fit anything except another lie.
 - If we are immortal, it is a fact of nature, and that fact does not depend on bibles, on Christs, priest, or creeds.
 - To hate man and worship God seems to be the sum of all the creeds.
 - Fear paints pictures of ghosts and hangs them in the gallery of ignorance.
 - On every hand there seems to be design to defeat design. If God created man – if he is the father of us all, why did he make the criminals, the insane, the deformed and idiotic? Should the mother, who clasps to her breast an idiot child, thank God?
 - If there is one subject in this world worthy of being discussed, worthy of being understood, it is the question of intellectual liberty. Without that, we are simply painted clay.
 - A false friend, an unjust judge, a braggart, hypocrite, and tyrant, sincere in hatred, jealous, vain and revengeful, false in promise, honest in curse, suspicious, ignorant, infamous and hideous-such is the God of the Pentateuch.
 - I would rather live with the woman I love in a world full of trouble, than to live in heaven with nobody but men.
 - Religion has not civilized man, man has civilized religion.
 - If there be gods we cannot help them, but we can assist our fellow men. We cannot love the inconceivable, but we can love wife and child and friend.
 - If we should put god in the Constitution there would be no room left for man.
 - Diderot took the ground that, if orthodox religion be true Christ was guilty of suicide. Having the power to defend himself he should have used it.
 - If I owe Smith ten dollars and God forgives me, that doesn’t pay Smith.
 - The inspiration of the Bible depends upon the ignorance of the gentleman who reads it.
 - If there is a God, there should be no slaves.
 - There is no evidence that God ever interfered in the affairs of man. The hand of earth is stretched uselessly towards heaven. From the clouds there comes no help.
 - To be like other people is to be unlike ourselves.
 - Music expresses feeling and thought, without language; it was below and before speech, and it is above and beyond all words.
 - If Jehovah cannot support his religion without going into partnership with a State Legislature, I think he ought to give it up.

 - Justice should remove the bandage from her eyes long enough to distinguish between the vicious and the unfortunate.
 - If the Bible and my brain are both the work of the same infinite God, whose fault is it that the book and my brain do not agree?
 - I hate above all things a cross man. What right has he to murder the sunshine of a day? What right has he to assassinate the Joy of life? When you go home, you ought to go like a ray of light-so that it will, even in the night, burst out of the doors and windows and illuminate the darkness.
 - All I have to say is, Love one another – that is the height of all philosophy. It is beyond all religions. It is the secret of joy – the fountain of Perpetual Youth – the only rainbow on life’s dark cloud.
 - The man who does not do his own thinking is a slave, and is a traitor to himself and to his fellow-men.
 - Like an armed warrior, like a plumed knight, James G. Blaine marched down the halls of the American Congress and threw his shining lance full and fair against the brazen foreheads of the defamers of his country, and the maligners of his honor.
 - The ministers, who preached at these revivals, were in earnest. They were zealous and sincere. They were not philosophers. To them science was the name of a vague dread – a dangerous enemy. They did not know much, but they believed a great deal.
 - My principal objections to orthodox religion are two: slavery here and hell hereafter.
 - Nothing could add to the horror of hell, except the presence of its creator, God.
 - Today the intelligence of the world denies the miraculous. Ignorance is the soil of the supernatural. The foundation of Christianity has crumbled, has disappeared, and the entire fabric must fall. The natural is true. The miraculous is false.
 - In a world of cruelty, sympathy is a crime, and in a world of lies, truth is blasphemy.
 - Every library is an arsenal.
 - If I had my way I’d make health catching instead of disease.
 - No man should kill himself as long as he can be of the least use to anybody, and if you cannot find some person that you are willing to do something for, find a good dog and take care of him. You have no idea how much better you will feel.

 - There is the same difference between talent and genius that there is between a stone mason and a sculptor.
 - Love your friends and be just to your enemies.
 - If we admit that some infinite being has controlled the destinies of persons and peoples, history becomes a most cruel and bloody farce.
 - The undressed is vulgar; the nude is pure, and the well-dressed tainted.
 - The most important thing in this world is liberty. More important than food or clothes – more important than gold or houses or lands – more important than art or science – more important than all religions, is the liberty of man.
 - It may be that ministers really think that their prayers do good, and it may be that frogs imagine that their croaking brings spring.
 - Take the word Liberty from human speech and all the other words become poor, withered, meaningless sounds – but with that word realized – with that word understood, the world becomes a paradise.
 - The meanest hut with love in it is a palace fit for the gods, and a palace without love is a den only fit for wild beasts.
 - Nothing but truth is immortal.
 - Death is only perfect rest.

 - The combined wisdom and genius of all mankind cannot possibly conceive of an argument against liberty of thought.
 - In the presence of eternity, the mountains are as transient as the clouds.
 - No one can control his own opinion or his own belief. My belief was forced upon me by my surroundings. I am the product of all circumstances that have in any way touched me.
 - There can be but little liberty on earth while men worship a tyrant in heaven.
 - Prayer is of no avail. The lightning falls on the just and the unjust in accordance with natural laws.
 - Reason, observation, and experience; the holy trinity of science.
 - It is told that the great Angelo, in decorating a church, painted some angels wearing sandals. A cardinal looking at the picture said to the artist: Whoever saw angels with sandals? Angelo answered with another question: Whoever saw an angel barefooted?
 - Let every man teach his son, teach his daughter, that labor is honorable.
 - If priests had not been fond of mutton, lambs never would have been sacrified to god. Nothing was ever carried to the temple that the priest could not use, and it always happened that god wanted what his agents liked.
 - Shakespeare has done far more for the world than the Bible.
 - If the world ever advances beyond what it is today, it must be led by men who express their real opinions.
 - If nobody has too much, everybody will have enough.
 - The only reason why we wish to exchange thoughts is that we are different. If we were all the same, we would die dumb. No thought would be expressed after we found that our thoughts were precisely alike. We differ-our thoughts are different. Therefore the commerse that we call conversation.
 - Christianity has such a contemptible opinion of human nature that it does not believe a man can tell the truth unless frightened by a belief in god. No lower opinion of the human race has ever been expressed.
 - For the most part we inherit our opinions. We are the heirs of habits and mental customs. Our beliefs, like the fashion of our garments, depend on where we were born. We are molded and fashioned by our surroundings.
 - The notion that faith in Christ is to be rewarded by an eternity of bliss, while a dependence upon reason, observation, and experience merits everlasting pain, is too absurd for refutation, and can be believed only by that unhappy mixture of insanity and ignorance, called faith.
 - Reason is the light, the sun of the brain. It is the compass of the mind, the ever-constant Northern Star, the mountain peak that lifts itself above all clouds.
 - What light is to the eyes – what air is to the lungs – what love is to the heart, liberty is to the soul of man.
 - Liberty cannot be sacrificed for the sake of temperance, for the sake of morality, or for the sake of anything. It is of more value than everything. Yet some people would destroy the sun to prevent the growth of weeds. Liberty sustains the same relation to all the virtues that the sun does to life.
 - Intellectual liberty is the air of the soul, the sunshine of the mind, and without it, the world is a prison, the universe is a dungeon.
 - The idea that there is a God who rewards and punishes, and who can reward, if he so wishes, the meanest and vilest of the human race, so that he will be eternally happy, and can punish the best of the human race, so that he will be eternally miserable, is subversive of all morality.
 - The more false we destroy, the more room there will be for the true.
 - It seems to me that if there is some infinite being who wants us to think alike he would have made us alike.
 - Nothing could be more dangerous to the existence of this Republic than to introduce religion into politics.

 - The Church has always been willing to swap off treasures in heaven for cash down.
 - Age after age, the strong have trampled upon the weak; the crafty and heartless have ensnared and enslaved the simple and innocent, and nowhere, in all the annals of mankind, has any god succored the oppressed.
 - There is only one way to be happy, and that is to make somebody else so, and you cannot be happy by going cross lots; you have got to go the regular turnpike road.
 - The man who invented the telescope found out more about heaven than the closed eyes of prayer ever discovered.
 - Language is not subtle enough, tender enough, to express all that we feel; and when language fails, the highest and deepest longings are translated into music. Music is the sunshine – the climate – of the soul, and it floods the heart with a perfect June.
 - The glory of science is, that it is freeing the soul, breaking the mental manacles, getting the brain out of bondage, giving courage to thought, filling the world with mercy, justice, and joy.
 - One laugh of a child will make the holiest day more sacred still.
 - Either god should have written a book to fit my brain, or he should have made my brain to fit his book.

 - It is an old habit with theologians to beat the living with the bones of the dead.
 - No man with a sense of humor ever founded a religion.
 - I have had some trouble in regarding evil as having been intended by infinite Goodness.
 - If, with all the time at my disposal, with all the wealth of the resources of this vast universe, to do with as I will, I could not produce a better scheme of life than now prevails, I would be ashamed of my efforts and consider my work a humiliating failure.
 - I cannot see why we should expect an infinite God to do better in another world than he does in this.
 - I know of no crime that has not been defended by the church, in one form or other. The church is not a pioneer; it accepts a new truth, last of all, and only when denial has become useless.
 - If this religion is true, then there is only one Savior, only one narrow path to life. Christianity cannot live in peace with any other religion.
 - This crime called blasphemy was invented by priests for the purpose of defending doctrines not able to take care of themselves.
 - I have no confidence in any religion that can be demonstrated only to children.
 - Joy is wealth and love is the legal tender of the soul.
 - Jehovah was not a moral god. He had all the vices and he lacked all the virtues. He generally carried out all his threats, but he never faithfully kept a promise.
 - I have little confidence in any enterprise or business or investment that promises dividends only after the death of the stockholders.
 - I am anxious to give away information, for it is only by giving it away that you can keep it. When you have told it, you remember it. It is with information as it is with liberty, the only way to be dead sure of it is to give it to other people.
 - We must remember that we have to make judges out of men, and that by being made judges their prejudices are not diminished and their intelligence is not increased.
 - When one of your children tells a lie, be honest with him; tell him that you have told hundreds of them yourself. Tell him it is not the best way; that you have tried it. Tell him as the man did in Maine when his boy left home: “John, honesty is the best policy; I have tried both.”
 - The good part of Christmas is not always Christian – it is generally Pagan; that is to say, human, natural.
 - The man who finds a truth lights a torch.
 - Secularism is a religion, a religion that is understood. It has no mysteries, no mumblings, no priests, no ceremonies, no falsehoods, no miracles, and no persecutions.
 - An infinite personality is an infinite impossibility.
 - God cannot send to eternal pain a man who has done something toward improving the condition of his fellow-man. If he can, I had rather go to hell than to heaven and keep company with such a god.
 - Catholicism is contrary to human liberty. Catholicism bases salvation upon belief. Catholicism teaches man to trample his reason under foot. And for that reason it is wrong.
 - Every flower about a house certifies to the refinement of somebody. Every vine climbing and blossoming tells of love and joy.
 - I would rather that we all should go to eternal chaos, to black and starless night, than that just one soul should suffer eternal agony.
 - The Declaration of Independence was a denial, and the first denial of a nation, of the infamous dogma that God confers the right upon one man to govern others.
 - Good nature is the cheapest commodity in the world, and love is the only thing that will pay ten percent to both borrower and lender.
 - Who can over estimate the progress of the world if all the money wasted in superstition could be used to enlighten, elevate and civilize mankind?
 - Every sect is a certificate that God has not plainly revealed his will to man. To each reader the Bible conveys a different meaning.
 - The credulity of the church is decreasing, and the most marvelous miracles are not either ‘explained,’ or allowed to take refuge behind the mistakes of the translators, or hide in the drapery of allegory.
 - Do you not know that every religion in the world has declared every other religion a fraud? Yes, we all know it. That is the time all religions tell the truth – each of the other.
 - If all the historic books of the Bible were blotted from the memory of mankind, nothing of value would be lost...
 - Religion is one of the phases of thought through which the world is passing.
 - An infinite God ought to be able to protect himself, without going in partnership with State Legislatures. Certainly he ought not so to act that laws become necessary to keep him from being laughed at. No one thinks of protecting Shakespeare from ridicule, by the threat of fine and imprisonment.
 - There is in all artists a little of the vagabond.
 - The hope of science is the perfection of the human race. The hope of theology is the salvation of a few, and the damnation of almost everybody.
 - Now the struggle for life is so sharp, competition is so severe, that few men can succeed who carry a useless burden. The businessmen of our country are compelled to lead temperate lives, otherwise their credit is gone.
 - The closer I’m bound in love to you, the closer I am to free.
 - Liberty is the breath of progress.

 - Heresy is a cradle; orthodoxy a coffin.
 - Custom meets us at the cradle and leaves us only at the tomb.
 - I found that the clergy did not understand their own book.
 - Twenty years after the death of Luther there were more Catholics than when he was born. And twenty years after the death of Voltaire there were millions less than when he was born.
 - If you have ever clothed another with woe, as with a garment of pain, you will never be quite as happy as though you had not done that thing.
 - There is no harmony between religion and science. When science was a child, religion sought to strangle it in the cradle. Now that science has attained its youth, and superstition is in its dotage, the trembling, palsied wreck says to the athlete: “Let us be friends.”
 - If there be an infinite Being, he does not need our help – we need not waste our energies in his defense.
 - Cruelty hardens and degrades, kindness reforms and ennobles.
 - For thousands of years people have been trying to force other people to think their way. Did they succeed? No. Will they succeed? No. Why? Because brute force is not an argument.
 - He raised his hands, not to strike, but in benediction. Lincoln was the grandest figure of the fiercest civil war. He is the gentlest memory of our world.
 - The Old Testament filled this world with tyranny and injustice, and the New gives us a future filled with pain for nearly all of the sons of men. The Old Testament describes the hell of the past, and the New the hell of the future.
 - As long as every question is answered by the word “God,” scientific inquiry is simply impossible.
 - Whoever increases the sum of human joy, is a worshiper. He who adds to the sum of human misery, is a blasphemer.
 - By physical liberty I mean the right to do anything which does not interfere with the happiness of another. By intellectual liberty I mean the right to think and the right to think wrong.
 - I thank thee, Mother Nature, that thou hast put ingenuity enough in the brain of a child, when attacked by a brutal parent, to throw up a little breastwork in the shape of a lie.
 - Memory is the miser of the mind; forgetfulness the spendthrift.
 - Love is natural. Back of allceremony burns and will forever burn the sacred flame. There has been no time in the world’s history when that torch was extinguished. In all ages, in all climes, among all people, there has been true, pure, and unselfish love.
 - Liberty is the condition of progress. Without Liberty, there remains only barbarism. Without Liberty, there can be no civilization.
 - I read the other day an account of a meeting between John Knox and John Calvin. Imagine a dialogue between a pestilence and a famine!
 - If we have the right to use our reason, we certainly have the right to act in accordance with it, and no god can have the right to punish us for such action.
 - Martyrdom, as a rule, establishes the sincerity of the martyr, never the correctness of his thought. Things are true or false in themselves.
 - Only those who live on the labor of the ignorant are the enemies of science. Real love and real religion are in no danger from science. The more we know the safer all good things are.
 - All prayers die in the air which they uselessly agitate.
 - They knew no better, but I do not propose to follow the example of a barbarian because he was honestly a barbarian.
 - Nothing could add to the horror of hell, except the presence of its creator, God. While I have life, as long as I draw breath, I shall deny with all my strength, and hate with every drop of my blood, this infinite lie.
 - Surely there is grandeur in knowing that in the realm of thought, at least, you are without a chain; that you have the right to explore all heights and depth; that there are no walls nor fences, nor prohibited places, nor sacred corners in all the vast expanse of thought.
 - To me, the most obscene word in our language is celibacy.
 - He who commends the brutalities of the past, sows the seeds of future crimes.
 - The doctrine of eternal punishment is in perfect harmony with the savagery of the men who made the orthodox creeds. It is in harmony with torture, with flaying alive, and with burnings.
 - Spirituality for the most part is a mask worn by idleness, arrogance and greed.
