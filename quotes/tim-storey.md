 - If you have a setback, Don’t take a step back- Get ready for a comeback!
 - Today’s decisions are tomorrow’s realities.
 - Somebody is waiting on the other side of your obedience.
 - Your life isn’t about the big break, it’s about one significant life transforming step at a time.
 - If I knew then what I know now, I would still be dreaming BIG today.
 - God gives you the sight, the right, and the might to do great things, but you have to develop the fight! Courage doesn’t happen without fear, doubt, and unbelief; courage overcomes all of these things to get the job done. How do we knock off fear or doubt out unbelief? Simple faith in God.
