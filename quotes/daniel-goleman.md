 - Green is a process, not a status. We need to think of ‘green’ as a verb, not an adjective.
 - Daydreaming defeats practice; those of us who browse TV while working out will never reach the top ranks. Paying full attention seems to boost the mind’s processing speed, strengthen synaptic connections, and expand or create neural networks for what we are practicing.
