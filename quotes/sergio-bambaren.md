 - The only fight you cannot win is the one you are not willing to fight. And the only dream that you cannot make come true is the one you cease to dream.
 - Decisions are a way of defining ourselves. There comes a time in life when there is nothing else to do but go your own way. Where you are headed there are no trails, no paths, just your own instincts.
