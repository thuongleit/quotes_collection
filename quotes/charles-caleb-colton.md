 - Time is the measurer of all things, but is itself immeasurable, and the grand discloser of all things, but is itself undisclosed.
 - Diffidence is the better part of knowledge.

 - Honor is unstable and seldom the same; for she feeds upon opinion, and is as fickle as her food.
 - We often pretend to fear what we really despise, and more often despise what we really fear.

 - We should choose our books as we would our companions, for their sterling and intrinsic merit.

 - Habit will reconcile us to everything but change.
 - Body and mind, like man and wife, do not always agree to die together.

 - Mystery magnifies danger, as a fog the sun, the hand that warned Belshazzar derived its horrifying effect from the want of a body.

 - Knowledge is two-fold, and consists not only in an affirmation of what is true, but in the negation of that which is false.

 - The highest knowledge can be nothing more than the shortest and clearest road to truth; all the rest is pretension, not performance, mere verbiage and grandiloquence, from which we can learn nothing.
 - When you have nothing to say, say nothing; a weak defense strengthens your opponent, and silence is less injurious than a bad reply.

 - Bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret.
 - Criticism is like champagne, nothing more execrable if bad, nothing more excellent if good; if meagre, muddy, vapid and sour, both are fit only to engender colic and wind; but if rich, generous and sparkling, they communicate a genial glow to the spirits, improve the taste, and expand the heart.

 - He that is good will infallibly become better, and he that is bad will as certainly become worse; for vice, virtue, and time are three things that never stand still.
 - To dare to live alone is the rarest courage; since there are many who had rather meet their bitterest enemy in the field, than their own hearts in their closet.
 - Suicide sometimes proceeds from cowardice, but not always; for cowardice sometimes prevents it; since as many live because they are afraid to die, as die because they are afraid to live.
 - Anguish of mind has driven thousands to suicide; anguish of body, none. This proves that the health of the mind is of far more consequence to our happiness than the health of the body, although both are deserving of much more attention than either of them receive.
 - Insults are engendered from vulgar minds, like toadstools from a dunghill.

 - Much too oft we make life gloomy – When happy we might be, If we gathered more of sunshine, And not dark shadows see.

 - Pity a thing often avowed, seldom felt; hatred is a thing often felt, seldom avowed.
 - He that has never known adversity is but half acquainted with others, or with himself.

 - With the offspring of genius, the law of parturition is reversed; the throes are in the conception, the pleasure in the birth.
 - Heaven may have happiness as utterly unknown to us as the gift of perfect vision would be to a man born blind. If we consider the inlets of pleasure from five senses only, we may be sure that the same Being who created us could have given us five hundred, if He had pleased.

 - He who studies books alone will know how things ought to be, and he who studies men will know how they are.
 - The temple of truth is built indeed of stones of crystal, but, inasmuch as men have been concerned in rearing it, it has been consolidated by a cement composed of baser materials.

 - When in reading we meet with any maxim that may be of use, we should take it for our own, and make an immediate application of it, as we would of the advice of a friend whom we have purposely consulted.
 - It is better to meet danger than to wait for it. He that is on a lee shore, and foresees a hurricane, stands out to sea and encounters a storm to avoid a shipwreck.

 - Doubt is the vestibule of faith.
 - He that dies a martyr proves that he was not a knave, but by no means that he was not a fool; since the most absurd doctrines are not without such evidence as martyrdom can produce. A martyr, therefore, by the mere act of suffering, can prove nothing but his own faith.
 - Our very best friends have a tincture of jealousy even in their friendship; and when they hear us praised by others, will ascribe it to sinister and interested motives if they can.
 - It may be observed of good writing, as of good blood, that it is much easier to say what it is composed of than to compose it.

 - To cure us of our immoderate love of gain, we should seriously consider how many goods there are that money will not purchase, and these the best; and how many evils there are that money will not remedy, and these the worst.
 - Philosophy is a goddess, whose head indeed is in heaven, but whose feet are upon earth; she attempts more than she accomplishes, and promises more than she performs.

 - Mathematicians have sought knowledge in figures, Philosophers in systems, Logicians in subtleties, and Metaphysicians in sounds. It is not in any nor in all of these.

 - There were moments of despondency when Shakespeare thought himself no poet, and Raphael no painter; when the greatest wits have doubted the excellence of their happiest efforts.

 - God is as great in minuteness as He is in magnitude.
 - Those who visit foreign nations, but associate only with their own country-men, change their climate, but not their customs. They see new meridians, but the same men; and with heads as empty as their pockets, return home with traveled bodies, but untravelled minds.
 - Secrecy is the soul of all great designs. Perhaps more has been effected by concealing our own intentions than by discovering those of our enemy.
 - Let us not be too prodigal when we are young, nor too parsimonious when we are old. Otherwise we shall fall into the common error of those, who, when they had the power to enjoy, had not the prudence to acquire; and when they had the prudence to acquire, had no longer the power to enjoy.
 - Revenge is a debt, in the paying of which the greatest knave is honest and sincere, and, so far as he is able, punctual.

 - Where thou perceivest knowledge, bend the ear of attention and respect; But yield not further to the teaching, than as thy mind is warranted by reasons. Better is an obstinant disputant, that yieldeth inch by inch, Than the shallow traitor to himself, who surrendereth to half an argument.

 - Sloth, if it has prevented many crimes, has also smothered many virtues.

 - Short as life is, some find it long enough to outlive their characters, their constitutions and their estates.

 - Constant success shows us but one side of the world. For as it surrounds us with friends who will tell us only our merits, so it silences those enemies from whom alone we can learn our defects.
 - He that thinks he is the happiest man, really is so. But he that thinks he is the wisest, is generally the greatest fool.
 - Gaming has been resorted to by the affluent as a refuge from ennui. It is a mental dram, and may succeed for a moment; but, like all other stimuli, it produces indirect debility.
 - Villains are usually the worst casuists, and rush into crimes to avoid less. Henry VIII. committed murder to avoid the imputation of adultery; and in our times, those who commit the latter crime attempt to wash off the stain of seducing the wife by signifying their readiness to shoot the husband.

 - Calumny crosses oceans, scales mountains and traverses deserts, with greater ease than the Scythian Abaris, and like him, rides upon a poisoned arrow.
 - In science, reason is the guide; in poetry, taste. The object of the one is truth, which is uniform and indivisible; the object of the other is beauty, which is multiform and varied.
 - Be very slow to believe that you are wiser than all others; it is a fatal but common error.

 - In religion as in politics it so happens that we have less charity for those who believe half our creed, than for those who deny the whole of it.
 - Princes rule the people, and their own passions rule Princes; but Providence can over-rule the whole, and draw the instruments of his inscrutable purposes from the vices, no less than the virtues of Kings.

 - Imitation is the highest form of flattery.
 - He that has energy enough to root out a vice should go further, and try to plant a virtue in its place.
 - In civil jurisprudence it too often happens that there is so much law, that there is no room for justice, and that the claimant expires of wrong in the midst of right, as mariners die of thirst in the midst of water.

 - That profound firmness which enabler a man to regard difficulties but as evils to be surmounted, no matter what shape they may assume.

 - Butler compared the tongues of these eternal talkers to race-horses, which go the faster the less weight they carry.
 - Is there anything more tedious than the often repeated tales of the old and forgetful?

 - Taking things not as they ought to be, but as they are, I fear it must be allowed that Macchiavelli will always have more disciples than Jesus.

 - The science of legislation is like that of medicine in one respect: that it is far more easy to point out what will do harm than what will do good.
 - No company is preferable to bad. We are more apt to catch the vices of others than virtues, as disease is far more contagious than health.
 - Life isn’t like a book. Life isn’t logical or sensible or orderly. Life is a mess most of the time. And theology must be lived in the midst of that mess.
 - The society of dead authors has this advantage over that of the living: they never flatter us to our faces, nor slander us behind our backs, nor intrude upon our privacy, nor quit their shelves until we take them down.
 - An honest man will continue to be so though surrounded on all sides by rogues.

 - The further we advance in knowledge, the more simplicity shall we discover in those primary rules that regulate all the apparently endless, complicated, and multiform operations of the Godhead.
 - As there are some faults that have been termed faults on the right side, so there are some errors that might be denominated errors on the safe side. Thus we seldom regret having been too mild, too cautious, or too humble; but we often repent having been too violent, too precipitate, or too proud.
 - The enthusiast has been compared to a man walking in a fog; everything immediately around him, or in contact with him, appears sufficiently clear and luminous; but beyond the little circle of which he himself is the centre, all is mist and error and confusion.
 - Jealousy is sustained as often by pride as by affection.
 - It is far better to borrow experience than to buy it.
 - The reason why great men meet with so little pity or attachment in adversity, would seem to be this: the friends of a great man were made by his fortune, his enemies by himself, and revenge is a much more punctual paymaster than gratitude.
 - Most importantly: Don’t adjust your results to build up the ego of the chief strategist. Especially if the strategist is you.
 - Theory is worth but little, unless it can explain its own phenomena, and it must effect this without contradicting itself; therefore, the facts are sometimes assimilated to the theory, rather than the theory to the facts.
 - As there are none so weak that we may venture to injure them with impunity, so there are none so low that they may not at some time be able to repay an obligation. Therefore, what benevolence would dictate, prudence would confirm.

 - When we feel a strong desire to thrust our advice upon others, it is usually because we suspect their weakness; but we ought rather to suspect our own.
 - It is not so difficult a task to plant new truths, as to root out old errors; for there is this paradox in men, they run after that which is new, but are prejudiced in favor of that which is old.

 - False reasoners are often best confuted by giving them the full swing of their own absurdities.
 - Silence is less injurious than a weak reply.

 - It is an easy and vulgar thing to please the mob, and no very arduous task to astonish them.

 - We submit to the society of those that can inform us, but we seek the society of those whom we can inform. And men of genius ought not to be chagrined if they see themselves neglected. For when we communicate knowledge, we are raised in our own estimation; but when we receive it, we are lowered.
 - There are some men who are fortune’s favorites, and who, like cats, light forever on their legs.

 - He that openly tells, his friends all that he thinks of them, must expect that they will secretly tell his enemies much that they do not think of him.
 - It is astonishing how much more anxious people are to lengthen life than to improve it; and as misers often lose large sums of money in attempting to make more, so do hypochondriacs squander large sums of time in search of nostrums by which they vainly hope they may get more time to squander.
 - A lady of fashion will sooner excuse a freedom flowing from admiration than a slight resulting from indifference.

 - If a cause be good, the most violent attack of its enemies will not injure it so much as an injudicious defence of it by its friends.
 - If sensuality be our only happiness we ought to envy the brutes, for instinct is a surer, shorter, safer guide to such happiness than reason.
 - Heroism, self-denial, and magnanimity, in all instances where they do not spring from a principle of religion, are but splendid altars on which we sacrifice one kind of self-love to another.
 - There are three kinds of power, – wealth, strength, and talent; but as old age always weakens, often destroys, the two latter, the aged are induced to cling with the greater avidity to the former.
