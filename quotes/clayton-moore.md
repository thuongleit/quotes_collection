 - Once I got the Lone Ranger role, I didn’t want any other.
 - I am a fighter. I believe in that which is right, and the truth is, I have been the Lone Ranger for the past thirty years and I will not give up the fight. I love my public and I’ll fight for you. I’ll continue to make personal appearances for my thousands of fans.
 - I will continue wearing the white hat and black mask until I ride up into the big ranch in the sky.
 - I often meet adults in their 30s, 40s, or 50s who, as soon as they recognize me, suddenly become six years old again.
 - I think you’re going to find out that westerns will be coming back. It’s Americana, it’s part of our history, the cowboy, the cattle drive, the sheriff, the fight for law, order and justice. Justice will always prevail as far as I’m concerned.
