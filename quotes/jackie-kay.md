 - When the love of your life dies, the problem is not that some part of you dies too, which it does, but that some part of you is still alive.
 - Nearly dying brings you closer to living. There’s a thin border; you feel yourself cross it, going back to the land of the living, going home. Perhaps, if you’d gone the other way, death would have been a different home.
 - Loss isn’t an absence after all. It is a presence. A strong presence right next to me. I look at it. It doesn’t look like anything, that’s what is so strange. It just fits in.
 - Sometimes you remember your life in photographs that were never taken.
 - How blazing and alive the past is. The color of the wallpaper in the bedroom you had as a girl. It’s not so much that you’ve lost your memory, more like you’re submerged in it, like you’re living in the brightly vivid underwater world of the past.
 - These days I can’t tell what I really feel.
