 - We don’t need virtual reality, we need virtual unreality.
 - Cinema is dead, long live cinema.
 - I think my films are always quite self-reflexive and always question ’why am I doing this, is this the right way to do it, what is cinema for, does it have a purpose?
 - I’ve always been fascinated by maps and cartography. A map tells you where you’ve been, where you are, and where you’re going – in a sense it’s three tenses in one.
 - Americans don’t understand what metaphor in cinema is about. They’re extremely good at making straightforward, linear narrative movies, which entertain superbly. But they very rarely do anything else.
 - If Good approved of his creature’s creation, He breathed the painted clay-model into life by signing His name.
 - Most cinema is not about images but text. Why on earth have we based cinema on text? Why can’t we break that umbilical cord? Why do we have to pollute cinema?

 - We live in a time of excess – excess population, excess information.
 - Too many proofs spoil the truth.
 - There’s no such thing as history, only historians. That’s how we know about the past.
 - I was born on the 5th April 1942. On Good Friday. Round about crucifixion time. Archbishop Ussher, a man for dates, who calculated that the world began on September 27th 4004 BC, says the crucifixion took place at three o’clock in the afternoon on Good Friday in the year 33 AD. I was right on time.
 - Every historian has a vested interest. “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” was not about the Roman but the British empire. What price the truth?
 - The pretence that numbers are not the humble creation of man, but are the exacting language of the Universe and therefore possess the secret of all things, is comforting, terrifying and mesmeric.
 - Painting is the supreme form of expression; you don’t need to ‘read’ painting.
 - The game Flights of Fancy or Reverse Strip Jump is played from as high a jumping-point as a competitor will dare. After each successful jump, the competitor is allowing to put on an article of clothing. Thirteen jumps is normally more than enough to see a competitor fully dressed for the day.

 - You can play lacrosse all over the world provided you know where the goalposts are.
 - I share this interest in the weird, strange, unusual, surreal.
 - A really intelligent man makes an indifferent painter. For painting requires a certain blindness, a partial refusal to be aware of all the options...
 - Imagine a world where nothing is stable. In the West, we have three moving elements – Air, Fire, Water – but at least we can depend on the fourth.
 - I went to art school, and every Tuesday and Friday we drew the nude. If you look at Western painting, male and female nudes are in the center of every painting. It’s difficult and exciting to draw the nude. Why get so upset about this? It’s our duty to break taboos.
 - Life is full of a thousand red herrings, and it takes the history of a civilisation to work out which are the red herrings and which aren’t.
 - I certainly don’t believe you documentary filmmakers. Like me, you are involved in making fiction, and your fiction is just as well organized and just as well predicated, but the big difference between me and you is that I’m honest and you’re dishonest. I know I’m telling you lies.
 - Anybody who writes a diary insists it must be read by someone else.
 - I am Welsh by birth, English by education, and European by nature.
 - As for critics, one mediocre writer is more valuable than ten good critics. They are like haughty, barren spinsters lodged in a maternity ward.
 - I like to think of The Falls as my own personal encyclopedia Greenaway-ensis.
 - I don’t believe in the deplorable notion of realism in the cinema: you can over-reach it, and it becomes as false as convention.
 - English culture is highly literary-based.
 - Whispering can be a rest from a noisy world of words.
 - The Sistine Chapel is an extraordinary work of education – it lays out all the early books of the Bible.
 - Since Caesar, we know his historians are liars. The good writers get read. Bad history doesn’t get read.
 - If you never lived out your sexuality – it’s a great force, and if you try to fight it, what does that create? Energy: positive and negative, self-loathing.
 - I don’t think we’ve seen any cinema yet. I think we’ve seen 100 years of illustrated text.
 - Only cinema narrows its concern down to its content, that is to its story. It should, instead, concern itself with its form, its structure.
 - I think my films are very English. That certain emotional distance, interest in the world, interest in irony. These are all deeply English propositions.
 - Cinema has reached a dead end.
 - You should be allowed to rub out and start again, it means that you are human. The purists are tedious, they tell you a mistake is like an enduring black mark. Nonsense – better to be human than some infernal machine never going wrong.
 - I never go to the cinema. I can’t stand sitting in the dark with strangers – all of us obliged to share the same emotional experiences – it’s too intimate. I like to be emotional in private.
 - A hand cannot write on itself.
 - There have been innumerable films about film-making, but Otto e Mezzo was a film about the processes of thinking about making a film – certainly the most enjoyable part of any cinema creation.

 - Cinema is far too rich and capable a medium to be merely left to the storytellers.
 - Cinema basically examines a personality first and the body afterward.
 - The start of a film is like a gateway, a formal entrance-point. The first three minutes of a film make great demands on an audience’s patience and credulity. A great deal has to be learnt very rapidly about place and attitude, character and intent and ambition.
 - I also think that everyone has an elitist approach to his own art, a complex knowledge of it, whether he is a clockmaker or an engineer. And I think it’s perfectly legitimate to make use of this knowledge because it enriches the overall texture of life.
 - My second Christian name is John. Good solid bourgeois Christian name, like my first name, Peter, a rock. Minerals. Build on rock, rocks, uranium. Peter and John were two of the twelve apostles – arguable the two most significant. Were my parents hedging their bets?
 - I suppose I am gently cynical about notions of who we think we are, but I certainly don’t hate my fellow man. I think my cinema, although it might often deal with death and decay, is highly celebratory.
 - The best painting is totally non-narrative. It doesn’t have to tell you a story.
 - In practically every film you experience, you can see the director following the text. Illustrating the words first, making the pictures after, and, alas, so often not making pictures at all, but holding up the camera to do its mimetic worst.
 - I wanted to make a cinema of ideas, not plots, and to use the same aesthetics as painting, which has always paid great attention to formal devices of structure, composition and framing.
 - I want to regard my public as infinitely intelligent, as understanding notions of the suspension of disbelief and as realising all the time that this is not a slice of life, this is openly a film.
 - Jean Renoir once suggested that most true creators have only one idea and spend their lives reworking it, but then very rapidly he added that most people don’t have any ideas at all, so one idea is pretty amazing.

 - I got in trouble with the stern-faced Russians who didn’t want me to create a guy who is mortal.
 - I do feel for me that cinema has somehow ceased to be a spectator sport. I get tremendous excitement out of making it rather than watching it.
 - I was continually connected with the whole world and never got any rest. At the moment, I spend only a few hours weekly on the net, that’s just better for me.
 - All the material is fictional and develops its own eight and a half private, coelesced journeys, where, perhaps not unexpectedly, the females can run faster than the men and trade their freedoms by exhausting the male sexual fantasies and replacing them by some of their own.

 - We all know that we’re going to die, but we don’t know when. That’s not a blessing, that’s a curse.

 - I don’t believe that one has to tear down the cinema screen in order to renew cinema. But new input and new energy are lacking. They are flowing above all into the television technologies. We must, therefore, concentrate on the CD-ROM.
 - The range of human skin colours is quite narrow when you think about it – and I do – and subtle – beige, pink, white, tan, taup...

 - One of my heroes, almost necessarily from what I’m saying, of course, is Borges, who is a supreme master of doing thing – being a data bank – and the beauty of this economy is that he could have written War and Peace in three or four pages; who knows, it might have been a better book.

 - It’s precisely on the Internet that the majority of the writing is terribly bad and uninteresting.

 - Cinema is not a playground for Sharon Stone.
 - We are all united by the phenomenon that we have a body and that body is universally the same, more or less. If we lose sight of that perspective, everything can desperately suffer.
