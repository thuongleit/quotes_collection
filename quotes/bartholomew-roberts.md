 - For I have dipped my hands in muddied waters, and, withdrawing them, find â€™tis better to be a commander than a common man!
 - A merry life and a short one shall be my motto.
 - There is none of you but will hang me, I know, whenever you can clinch me within your power.
 - Damn to him who ever lived to wear a Halter!
