 - Then one day I thought it would be wonderful to make a whole book, to make my text and my drawings together, and that’s how I started doing children’s books.
 - Each book first begins with a little idea.
 - I did about 2000 covers altogether, for all sorts of books – from Shakespeare to James Bond – and I always had the idea that I must give 100%, no matter who the author was.
 - I have been drawing all my life.
 - I thought it would be very nice to become Picasso or Rembrandt, or a van Gogh.
 - I come from a family of business people, but I had the idea I wanted to become an artist.
 - I want a nice picture book with 12 pictures – I do my best with that format.
 - When I make a book, I make it for the child and not for the parent – no jokes in it for the parents!
 - I thought it was amazing to work with authors, to get a manuscript and try to make up a cover for it.
 - My father realised that for me to become a publisher in his firm would have been the end of the firm!
 - But we discovered that, although I liked publishing, the commercial side meant nothing at all to me.
 - Now, I had been drawing all this time – especially in France of course – so, when I came back, my father gave me the chance to do a cover for one of the books he published.
