 - Every step in the progress of missions is directly traceable to prayer.
 - There has never been a spiritual awakening in any country or locality that did not begin in united prayer.
 - A marble cutter, with chisel and hammer, was changing a stone into a statue. A preacher looking on said: “I wish I could deal such changing blows on stony hearts.” The workman answered: “Maybe you could, if you worked like me, upon your knees.”
 - Closet communion needs time for the revelation of God’s presence. It is vain to say, “I have too much work to do to find time.” You must find time or forfeit blessing. God knows how to save for you the time you sacredly keep for communion with Him.
 - If missions languish, it is because the whole life of godliness is feeble. The command to go everywhere and preach to everybody is not obeyed until the will is lost by self-surrender in the will of God. Living, praying, giving and going will always be found together.
 - The Word of God represents all the possibilities of God as at the disposal of true prayer.
 - Partial examination will result in partial views of truth, which are necessarily imperfect; only careful comparisons will show the complete mind of God.
 - By faith we are taken into Christ, made at once safe from holy wrath against sin, and kept safe from all perils and penalties. He, our divine Redeemer, becomes to us the new sphere of harmony and unity with God and His law, with His life and His holiness.
 - God has no greater controversy with His people today than this, that with boundless promises to believing prayer, there are so few who actually give themselves unto intercession.
 - Jesus stands absolutely alone in history; in teaching, in example, in character, an exception, a marvel, and He is Himself the evidence of Christianity.
 - From all human oracles, however self-confident, we turn at last to the inspired Word, where instead of ambiguous and untrustworthy utterances, we find teachings distinct and definite, authoritative and infallible.
