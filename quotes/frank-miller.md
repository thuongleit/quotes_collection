 - Of course we’re Criminals.
 - The day you write to please everyone you no longer are in journalism. You are in show business.
 - Sometimes the solitary voice can be the best one.
 - My Sin City heroes are knights in dirty, blood-caked armor. They bring justice to a world that gives them no medals, no praise, no reward. That world, that city, often kills them for their brave service.

 - I check the list. Rubber tubing, gas, saw, gloves, cuffs, razor wire, hatchet, Gladys, and my mitts.

 - My feeling is that the hero has now been defined by phrases like the odious one that we were all raised with – crimes does not pay. Of course it pays, you schmuck. That’s not why we don’t do it. We don’t do it because it is wrong.
 - Comic-book pages are vertical, and movie screens are relentlessly horizontal. But it’s all the same form. We use different tools, but we get the job done. I’m completely in love with CGI. It’s great for conveying a cartoonist’s sense of reality.

 - I’m not going to complain about the fact that people are paying attention to my work. I suppose that wouldn’t be fair.

 - When I’m writing a comic book, I’m thinking about a character that I’m going to be drawing on the page. I’ve never drawn a character to look like who I want to cast in a movie because I don’t think that way. I’m a real monomaniac. I do one thing at a time.

 - I think most things I read on the Internet and in newspapers are propaganda. Everyone from the ‘New York Times’ to Rupert Murdoch has a point of view and is putting forth their own propaganda. They’re stuck with the facts as they are, but the way they interpret and frame them is wildly different.
 - I realized that I was about to turn 30, and Batman was permanently 29. And I was going to be damned if I was older than Batman.
 - I grew up on the crime stuff. Spillane, Chandler, Jim Thompson, and noir movies like Fuller, Orson Welles, Fritz Lang. When I first showed up in New York to write comics back in the late 1970s, I came with a bunch of crime stories but everybody just wanted men in tights.
 - I find that if somebody is writing and drawing a comic book, planning it to be a movie and a game at the same time tends to lead to a pretty lame job.
 - The most questionable thing I did was make Superman a government agent. If this had been a Superman story, I’d never have done that – and I know that, because I have a Superman story I want to tell someday. In this story, Batman was the hero, so the world was built around him.
 - Think of me as the weathered sheriff coming back into Dodge ’cause the youngsters are shooting up the church and scaring the horses and not doing right by the women.

 - What I want to bring back to superheroes with this project is a sense of play. Things have gotten so dreary. The heroes have gotten so ugly that even their muscles have muscles.
 - I moved to New York and was told, “Go back home. We don’t need you. Go pump gas. You’re from Vermont. We’ve got no use for you. You’re not drawing guys in tights.” So, I learned how to draw guys in tights, and I put them in as many crime situations as I could.

 - The Dark Knight series is all from Batman’s point of view. But if you look at Dark Knight 2, you’ll see a Superman who’s much calmer than the one in the first Dark Knight.
