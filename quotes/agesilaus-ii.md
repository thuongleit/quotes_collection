 - By sowing frugality we reap liberty, a golden harvest.
 - If I have done any deed worthy of remembrance, that deed will be my monument. If not, no monument can preserve my memory.
 - If I have done any honorable exploit, that is my monument; but if I have done none, all your statues will signify nothing.
 - If all men were just there would be no need of valor.
 - Royalty consists not in vain pomp, but in great virtues.
 - Valor would cease to be a virtue, if there were no injustice.
 - I shall show that the place does not honor the man, but the man the place.
