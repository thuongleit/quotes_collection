 - Striving for happiness is a long, hard journey with many challenges. It requires eternal vigilance to win the victory. You cannot succeed with sporadic little flashes of effort. Constant and valiant living is necessary.
 - We have every confidence that earth and hell will not overtake you, but it will require that you move from your current plateaus and climb to higher ground.
 - If you would find happiness and joy, lose your life in some noble cause. A worthy purpose must be at the center of every worthy life.
 - Much of our love is confined to mere lip service and dreams of good deeds accomplished, but true love must be expressed in unselfish acts of kindness that bring others closer to our Heavenly Father.
