 - War always takes you by surprise.
 - We found ourselves veiled and separated from our friends.
 - I wanted to make a real love story with a bad ending, because a love story that ends good is the life of everyone. I always say to people, You know, if Romeo and Juliet got married, nobody would care about them. Imagine Romeo and Juliet, six kids yelling, mama, mama, papa, papa.
 - I don’t want to quit smoking. I am convinced that if I quit smoking, the world would go to hell.

 - For me, drawing is a question of death and life. Every day I draw, I write, I do something.
 - Human beings have a lot of problems identifying themselves with other human beings who don’t resemble them exactly. But there’s something about drawing that means that anyone can identify to a drawing. I mean, people can identify themselves with Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse.

 - The first writing of the human being was drawing, not writing.
 - In any case, it’s the cowardice of people like you who give dictators the chance to install themselves!
 - My culture comes from everywhere. I’m sick of this notion of nationality, that if you’re brought up in the same city or same country you’re the same. Even three kids brought up in the same family with the same genes, they are not the same. Just consider a human a human.
 - I love the French for their sarcasm, their irony. I love them for their bad moods.
 - I have been brought up open-minded. If I didn’t know any people from other countries, I’d think everyone was evil based on news stories. But I know a lot of people, and know that there is no such thing as stark good and evil. Isn’t it possible there is the same amount of evil everywhere?

 - This clash of the culture, East and the West, us and them, Muslim and Christian, does not exist.

 - I am very bad at computers. I don’t really know how to write email.
 - I think animation is like running a marathon, and making a movie is like a 100 meter sprint. The question is: are you a marathon man or are you a sprinter? I realized that I was more of a sprinter than a marathon man. With a long, long project, I get bored easily.

 - I’m a very individualistic person. That is why I don’t belong to any political party or anything. I really believe in justice and freedom.
 - Comics are just another medium to express yourself. It’s not cinema; it’s not literature; it’s just something else. It has a specific requirement, which is that images are used to tell the story. There are lots of crappy movies, with guns and action and Arnold Schwarzenegger or whatever.
 - I like to make mechanical stuff. Once I make a film I have to do whatever I can make onstage I make it onstage.

 - If people are given the chance to experience life in more than one country, they will hate a little less. It’s not a miracle potion, but little by little you can solve problems in the basement of a country, not on the surface.
 - With live-action I think we’d have lost the universal appeal of the Persepolis story. With live-action, it would have turned into a story of ‘the Other’ – people living in a distant land who don’t look like us. It might have been exotic, but also a “Third-World” story.

 - Maybe the biggest problem is that there’s no empathy. Nobody puts themselves in the place of others. Everyone thinks they are the only one to suffer. Or that they’re the only ones who like ice cream or take their kids on vacation.
 - I don’t believe in the clash of cultures. The culture is one. The culture is a ring off the same chain. Picasso was very much influenced by the African arts, and he influenced a whole other generation of artists. So everything influences everything.

 - To tell you the truth, I never wanted to become a moviemaker. It was like I was a cinepihile, and I go, like, three or four times per week to the cinema, and I like to watch films.
 - I try to look at life carefully and reproduce life the way life is. It’s a question of looking carefully at how it is. In life, you don’t have total happiness. People always say that. But you don’t have total sadness either, no matter what situation you are living in.
 - Adaptation of books is never a success. When the author wants to make it, it’s even worse.
 - A cat can never be well-trained because they’re too independent.

 - If today I have to make a political statement, it is, ‘I love beauty.’ I think beauty makes people better.

 - I’m not somebody that keeps the thing in her heart. I can get very angry for five minutes, but then it’s finished. Once I’ve yelled, it’s over.
 - If it’s a good work of adaptation, the book should remain a book and the film should remain a film, and you should not necessarily read the book to see the film. If you do need that, then that means that it’s a failure. That is what I think.

 - People, they think that animation is a style. Animation is just a technique. It’s like, people, they think that comics is a style, like comics is a superhero story. Comic is just a narration, and is a medium, you can say any kind of story in comics and you can say of any kind of story in animation.
 - The movie business is not about the money. Of course, you need money to make the movie. If you have a small budget, adapt yourself. Having $200 million dollars doesn’t ensure that you’re definitely going to make a good movie. There’s so many examples that prove that.
 - I think the best work of the director is to listen to what all the technicians around him have to say, but then the thing is to take the best decision, what you think is the best. Then, that is the moment where you have to have all the film in your head and imagine how all of that will fit together.
 - The information I have about Iran is second hand.
 - I had two major activities as a child. I was trying to put on shows with kids in my street, or I was drawing. Actually, what I’m doing now is exactly what I was doing then.

 - I wanted to do my artistic work, and in Iran you have censorship. It was difficult for me to do the work I wanted to do.
 - I don’t like ‘graphic novel.’ It’s a word that publishers created for the bourgeois to read comics without feeling bad. Comics is just a way of narrating – it’s just a media type.
 - You never have these moments that, you know, are always perfect. Always something happens.
 - Any medium can only live up to the strengths of the people working in it. If it’s been used to tell bad or boring stories, it’s not a problem with comics; it’s a problem with the writers of those comics.
 - For me, who loves to draw and who loves to write and cannot choose between one or the other, the comic is the best form.
 - You know, the cynicism that is in the politics, it is not for my soul. It makes me – out of me, an extremely bitter, cynical person that I hate to see in the mirror, really.

 - I’m not a religious person at all.
 - A Muslim fanatic and a Christian fanatic, a Jewish fanatic, a secular fanatic, an atheist fanatic, a communist fanatic – all of them are the same. The thinking that, ‘If you don’t think like me, that if you are not with me, then you are against me;’ this is something to condemn.
 - Words also are filters. They have to be translated. Even in the original language, there is interpretation and some ambiguity. If there’s a cultural difference between the writer and the reader, that might come out in words. But with pictures, there’s more efficiency.
 - I am absolutely not a feminist, I am against stupidity, and if it comes from males or females, it doesn’t change anything. If it means that women and men, they are equal, then OK, certainly I am a feminist.

 - But violence is news, to a certain extent, and people don’t want complicated news. Because as soon as you realize things are complicated, your life becomes more complicated.

 - I had so many professions before. I didn’t want to do this particularly. It just happened.

 - Politicians think they have answers for everything. We artists, we only have questions.

 - Life is complex. You don’t have any person who is nice from the beginning until the end. You don’t always have the notion of redemption. The bad people don’t always pay.
 - When you make a book or you make a movie, it is almost like hitting on somebody. It’s not because you want to seduce people that you will seduce them; you can hit on somebody and it doesn’t work. But when you hit on them and it works, then it’s really cool.
 - Graphic novels are not traditional literature, but that does not mean they are second-rate. Images are a way of writing. When you have the talent to be able to write and to draw, it seems a shame to choose one. I think it’s better to do both.
