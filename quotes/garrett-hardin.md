 - Throughout history, human exploitation of the earth has produced this progression: colonize-destroy-move on.
 - There is nothing more dangerous than a shallow thinking compassionate person.
 - Freedom in a commons brings ruin to all.
 - The population problem has no technical solution; it requires a fundamental extension in morality.
 - Education can counteract the natural tendency to do the wrong thing, but the inexorable succession of generations requires that the basis for this knowledge be constantly refreshed.
 - No one should be able to enter a wilderness by mechanical means.
 - Of course, a positive growth rate might be taken as evidence that a population is below its optimum.
 - You can never do merely one thing. The law applies to any action that changes something in a complex system. The point is that an action taken to alleviate a problem will trigger several effects, some of which may offset or even negate the one intended.
 - Thou shalt not transgress the carrying capacity.
 - Ecological differentiation is the necessary condition for coexistence.
 - Indeed, our particular concept of private property, which deters us from exhausting the positive resources of the earth, favors pollution.
 - The essence of dramatic tragedy is not unhappiness. It resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things.
 - But as population became denser, the natural chemical and biological recycling processes became overloaded, calling for a redefinition of property rights.
 - Continuity is at the heart of conservatism: ecology serves that heart.
 - In a competitive world of limited resources, total freedom of individual action is intolerable.
 - Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce; it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.
 - Ruin is the destination toward which all men rush, each pursuing his own best interest in a society that believes in the freedom of the commons.
 - The morality of an act is a function of the state of the system at the time it is performed.
 - The social arrangements that produce responsibility are arrangements that create coercion, of some sort.
 - The Universal Declaration of Human Rights describes the family as the natural and fundamental unit of society. It follows that any choice and decision with regard to the size of the family must irrevocably rest with the family itself, and cannot be made by anyone else.
 - You cannot do only one thing.
 - Incommensurables cannot be compared.
 - The only thing we can really count on in this uncertain world is human unreliability itself.
 - Fundamentalists are panicked by the apparent disintegration of the family, the disappearance of certainty and the decay of morality. Fear leads them to ask, if we cannot trust the Bible, what can we trust?
 - A finite world can support only a finite population; therefore, population growth must eventually equal zero.
 - It is a mistake to think that we can control the breeding of mankind in the long run by an appeal to conscience.
 - It takes five years for a willing person’s mind to change. Have patience with yourself and others when treading in an area protected by a taboo.
 - The god who is reputed to have created fleas to keep dogs from moping over their situation must also have created fundamentalists to keep rationalists from getting flabby. Let us be duly thankful for out blessings.
 - We can’t cure a shortage by increasing the supply.
 - The only kind of coercion I recommend is mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon by the majority of the people affected.
 - The rational man finds that his share of the cost of the wastes he discharges into the commons is less than the cost of purifying his wastes before releasing them.
 - Every plausible policy must be followed by the question ‘And then what?’
 - In a finite world this means that the per capita share of the world’s goods must steadily decrease.
 - The optimum population is, then, less than the maximum.
 - However, I think the major opposition to ecology has deeper roots than mere economics; ecology threatens widely held values so fundamental that they must be called religious.
 - A coldly rationalist individualist can deny that he has any obligation to make sacrifices for the future.
 - To say that we mutually agree to coercion is not to say that we are required to enjoy it, or even to pretend we enjoy it.
 - A technical solution may be defined as one that requires a change only in the techniques of the natural sciences, demanding little or nothing in the way of change in human values or ideas of morality.
 - Value is a relative concept: the value of each action is determined by comparing it with other possible actions.
 - What features of your daily life do you expect to be improved by a further increase in population?
 - The greatest folly is to accept expert statements uncritically. At the very least, we should always seek another opinion.
 - Never globalize a problem if it can possibly be dealt with locally.
 - We see only what we have names for.
 - In an approximate way, the logic of commons has been understood for a long time, perhaps since the discovery of agriculture or the invention of private property in real estate.
 - Religious reasons, which is no reason. I notice Skeptic had a review of Dennett’s book, Darwin’s Dangerous Idea. Religious reasons amount to what Dennett terms “skyhooks.” Do you believe in skyhooks? I don’t.
 - An attack on values is inevitably seen as an act of subversion.
 - Using the commons as a cesspool does not harm the general public under frontier conditions, because there is no public, the same behavior in a metropolis is unbearable.
 - Every measured thing is part of a web of variables more richly interconnected than we know.
 - Why are ecologists and environmentalists so feared and hated? This is because in part what they have to say is new to the general public, and the new is always alarming.
