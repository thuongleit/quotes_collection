 - The most important role models in people’s lives, it seems, aren’t superstars or household names. They’re “everyday” people who quietly set examples for you-coaches, teachers, parents. People about whom you say to yourself, perhaps not even consciously, “I want to be like that.”
 - Forget those things that aren’t worth remembering.
 - Humility is always one play away.
