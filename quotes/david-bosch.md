 - To participate in mission is to participate in the movement of God’s love toward people, since God is a fountain of sending love.
 - Mission is not primarily an activity of the church, but an attribute of God.
 - Missionary activity is not so much the work of the church as simply the Church at work.
 - Only the willing to suffer can conquer suffering.
 - Our missionary activities are only authentic insofar as they reflect participation in the mission of God.
 - If the Church is ‘in Christ,’ she is involved in mission. Her whole existence then has a missionary character. Her conduct as well as her words will convince the unbelievers and put their ignorance and stupidity to silence.
 - The church is not made up of spiritual giants; only broken men can lead others to the cross.
