 - So long as mists envelop you, be still. Be still until the sunlight pours through and dispels the mists â€“ as it surely will. Then act with courage.
 - You live on Earth only for a few short years which you call an incarnation, and then you leave your body as an outworn dress and go for refreshment to your true home in the spirit.
