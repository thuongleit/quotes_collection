 - If you can’t program it, you haven’t understood it.
 - Base metals can be transmuted into gold by stars, and by intelligent beings who understand the processes that power stars, but by nothing else in the universe.
 - The quantum theory of parallel universes is not the problem, it is the solution. It is not some troublesome, optional interpretation emerging from arcane theoretical considerations. It is the explanation, the only one that is tenable, of a remarkable and counter-intuitive reality.
 - The most important application of quantum computing in the future is likely to be a computer simulation of quantum systems, because that’s an application where we know for sure that quantum systems in general cannot be efficiently simulated on a classical computer.
 - Discovering a new explanation is inherently an act of creativity.
 - Feeling insignificant because the universe is large has exactly the same logic as feeling inadequate for not being a cow.
 - No precautions, and no precautionary principle, can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee. We need a stance of problem-fixing, not just problem-avoidance.
 - It is possible to build a virtual-reality generator whose repertoire includes every possible environment.
 - I myself believe that there will one day be time travel because when we find that something isn’t forbidden by the over-arching laws of physics we usually eventually find a technological way of doing it.
 - Is the human race a universal constructor?
 - The brain is the only kind of object capable of understanding that the cosmos is even there, or why there are infinitely many prime numbers, or that apples fall because of the curvature of space-time, or that obeying its own inborn instincts can be morally wrong, or that it itself exists.
 - Science is objective. And in my view we cannot take any experimental results seriously except in the light of good explanations of them.
 - Every problem that is interesting is also soluble.
 - Despite the unrivaled empirical success of quantum theory, the very suggestion that it may be literally true as a description of nature is still greeted with cynicism, incomprehension, and even anger.
 - Humans may or may not have cosmic significance, and if they do, it will be by hitching a ride on the objective centrality of knowledge in the cosmic scheme of things.
 - Our best theories are not only truer than common sense, they make more sense than common sense.
 - I don’t think it would be a good idea for scientists to have more political power. Scientists as a group are more inclined to try to derive an ought from an is, than the population at large.
 - To me quantum computation is a new and deeper and better way to understand the laws of physics, and hence understanding physical reality as a whole.
 - I chop and change between what is called ‘work’ and what is called ‘recreation.’ There are no discontinuities in my day. I only play tennis with people I find interesting.
 - Where we have good, testable explanations, they then have to be tested, and we drop the ones that fail the tests.
 - Time travel may be achieved one day, or it may not. But if it is, it should not require any fundamental change in world-view, at least for those who broadly share the world view I am presenting in this book.
 - The overwhelming majority of theories are rejected because they contain bad explanations, not because they fail experimental tests.
 - The truly privileged theories are not the ones referring to any particular scale of size or complexity, nor the ones situated at any particular level of the predictive hierarchy, but the ones that contain the deepest explanations.
