 - Sow seeds of hope and enjoy optimism. Sow seeds of doubt and expect insecurity.
 - If anybody understands God’s order for his children, it’s someone who has rescued an orphan from despair, for that is what God has done for us. God has adopted you. God sought you, found you, signed the papers and took you home.

 - In the great orchestra we call life, you have an instrument and a song, and you owe it to God to play them both sublimely.

 - To accept grace is to admit failure, a step we are hesitant to take. We opt to impress God with how good we are rather than confessing how great he is.
 - Be a child again. Flirt. Giggle. Dip your cookies in your milk. Take a nap. Say you’re sorry if you hurt someone. Chase a butterfly. Be a child again.

 - Just as your earthly house is a place of refuge, so God’s house is a place of peace.

 - You are never more like Jesus than when you pray for others. Pray for this hurting world.

 - Here’s what you need to keep in mind. You no longer have yesterday. You do not yet have tomorrow. You have only today. This is the day the Lord has made. Live in it.
 - Don’t equate the presence of God with a good mood or a pleasant temperament. God is near whether you are happy or not.
 - Gratitude. More aware of what you have than what you don’t. Recognizing the treasure in the simple – a child’s hug, fertile soil, a golden sunset. Relishing in the comfort of the common.

 - Though the Bible was written over sixteen centuries by at least forty authors, it has one central theme-salvation through faith in Christ.

 - A book should be a garden that fits in the hands. Word-petals of color. Stems of strength. roots of truth. Turn a page and turn the seasons. Read the sentence and enjoy the roses.

 - Worry is to joy what a Hoover vacuum cleaner is to dirt: might as well attach your heart to a happiness-sucker and flip the switch.
 - Grace is God as heart surgeon, cracking open your chest, removing your heart – poisoned as it is with pride and pain – and replacing it with his own.

 - People are watching the way we act, more than they are listening to what we say.

 - Even though you may not understand how God works, you know he does.
 - We live in the most multicultural, multiracial, multiethnic America ever, and I get the sense that because of that reality so many of us are turning nativist.

 - Your serenity matters to heaven. God’s presence encapsulates your life.

 - Gratitude lifts our eyes off the things we lack so we might see the blessings we possess.
 - Never underestimate the power that comes when a parent pleads with God on behalf of a child.
 - Others have promised and failed. But God has promised and succeeded. He loves you with an unfailing love.

 - You’re never without hope, because you’re never without prayer.

 - God, the Master Weaver. He stretches the yarn and intertwines the colors, the ragged twine with the velvet strings, the pains with the pleasures. Nothing escapes his reach.

 - What makes a Christian a Christian is not perfection but forgiveness.
 - Mark it down. You will never go where God is not.
 - To see sin without grace is despair. To see grace without sin is arrogance. To see them in tandem is conversion.

 - God would prefer we have an occasional limp than a perpetual strut.

 - Whether or not storms come, we can not choose. But where we stare during a storm, that we can.
 - Have you been called to go out on a limb for God? You can bet it won’t be easy. Limb-climbing has never been easy. Ask Joseph. Or, better yet, ask Jesus. He knows better than anyone the cost of hanging on a tree.

 - A season of suffering is a small assignment when compared to the reward. Rather than begrudge your problem, explore it. Ponder it. And most of all, use it. Use it to the glory of God.

 - We may speak about a place where there are no tears, no death, no fear, no night; but those are just the benefits of heaven. The beauty of heaven is seeing God.

 - One of the things I discover a lot in marriage counseling is the husband or wife trying to get their spiritual thirst quenched by their partner; I think that’s a real common mistake that we make.
