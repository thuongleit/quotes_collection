 - You paint the way you have to in order to give. That’s life itself, and someone will look and say it is the product of knowing, but it has nothing to do with knowing, it has to do with giving.
 - I paint not the things I see but the feelings they arouse in me.
 - If you’re a painter, you’re not alone. There’s no way to be alone.
 - To be right is the most terrific personal state that nobody is interested in.
