 - If at first you donâ€™t succeed, you can always become an ultramarathoner.
 - Racing should never be an ordeal, rather an enjoyable and life-enhancing experience.
 - During the hard training phase never be afraid to take a day off. If your legs are feeling unduly stiff and sore, rest; if you are at all sluggish, rest; in fact, if in doubt, rest.
