 - Entropy is the price of structure.
 - We grow in direct proportion to the amount of chaos we can sustain and dissipate.
 - The main character of any living system is openness.
 - The statistical probability that organic structures and the most precisely harmonized reactions that typify living organisms would be generated by accident, is zero.
 - The real is only one realization of the possible.
 - The world is richer than it is possible to express in any single language.
 - The irreversibility of time is the mechanism that brings order out of chaos.
 - The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism.
 - In far from equilibrium conditions, the concept of probability that underlies Boltzmannâ€™s order principle is no longer valid if the structures we observe do not correspond to a maximum of complexions.
 - The idea of spontaneous generation of life in its present form is therefore highly improbable even to the scale of the billions of years during which prebotic evolution occurred.
 - Now we see evolutionary trends in a variety of areas ranging from atomic and molecular physics through fluid mechanics, chemistry and biology to large scale systems of relevance in environmental and economic sciences.
