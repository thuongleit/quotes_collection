 - Be a leader, not a follower. Never let anyone tell you what you can and cannot be.
 - If you want success, you have to work hard at it and realize that it takes time; it doesn’t come to you overnight.
 - Always follow your heart and have faith in yourself and believe in the Lord and He will believe in you.
 - I don’t think about the past, I only think about the present because what I do today sets me up for the future.
 - The only time I really get afraid is when something is affecting my family. But even then, I start to think about the Bible and the passage that says “you should fear no one, fear no man, but only God,” and I feel better.
 - I wake up each and everyday happy because of all of the great things that I have going on in my life and I think about all of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me.
