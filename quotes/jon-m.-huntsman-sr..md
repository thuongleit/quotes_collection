 - Life is not a game of Solitaire; people depend on one another. When one does well, others are lifted. When one stumbles, others also are impacted. There are no one-man teams – either by definition or natural law. Success is a cooperative effort; it’s dependent upon those who stand beside you.
 - A crisis creates the opportunity to dip deep into the reservoirs of our very being, to rise to levels of confidence, strength, and resolve that otherwise we didn’t think we possessed.
 - Wealth isn’t always measured in dollar signs. We each have time, talent and creativity, all of which can be powerful forces for positive change. Share your blessings in whatever form they come and to whatever level you have been blessed.
 - Share your blessings in whatever form they come and to whatever level you have been blessed.
 - Engaging in activities devoid of difficulty, lounging in risk-free zones, is life without great meaning.
