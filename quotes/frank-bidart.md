 - We fill pre-existing forms and when we fill them we change them and are changed.
 - Insanity is the insistence on meaning.
 - But being is making; not only large things, a family, a book, a business; but the shape we give this afternoon, a conversation between friends, a meal.
 - Making is the mirror in which we see ourselves.
 - We live in a hell of opinions.
 - Play, and escaping the ideology one grew up in, is freedom.
