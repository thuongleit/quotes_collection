 - We sometimes underestimate the influence of little things.
 - Thereâ€™s time enough, but none to spare.
 - Impossibilities are merely things of which we have not learned, or which we do not wish to happen.
 - As man sows, so shall he reap. In works of fiction, such men are sometimes converted. More often, in real life, they do not change their natures until they are converted into dust.
 - There are sordid souls that eat and drink and breed and die, and imagine they have lived.
 - Those that set in motion the forces of evil cannot always control them afterwards.
 - Sins, like chickens, come home to roost.
 - We are all puppets in the hands of fate and seldom see the strings...
 - Race prejudice is the devil unchained.
 - The workings of the human heart are the profoundest mystery of the universe. One moment they make us despair of our kind, and the next we see in them the reflection of the divine image.
 - I think I must write a book. It has been my cherished dream and I feel an influence that I cannot resist calling me to the task.
 - The workings of the human heart are the profoundest mystery of the universe.
 - We make our customs lightly; once made, like our sins, they grip us in bands of steel; we become the creatures of our creation.
