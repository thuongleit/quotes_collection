 - I am an affirmative action hire.
 - We read in bed because reading is halfway between life and dreaming, our own consciousness in someone else’s mind.

 - Amid attempts to protect elephants from ivory poachers and dolphins from tuna nets, the rights of children go remarkably unremarked.

 - All of us want to do well. But if we do not do good, too, then doing well will never be enough.

 - The Statue of Liberty is meant to be shorthand for a country so unlike its parts that a trip from California to Indiana should require a passport.
 - We don’t do ambivalence well in America. We do courage of our convictions. We do might makes right. Ambivalence is French. Certainty is American.

 - When an actress takes off her clothes onscreen but a nursing mother is told to leave, what message do we send about the roles of women?

 - I feel about exercise the same way that I feel about a few other things: that there is nothing wrong with it if it is done in private by consenting adults.
