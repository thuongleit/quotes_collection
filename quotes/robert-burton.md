 - Be not solitary, be not idle.
 - What a glut of books! Who can read them?
 - No rule is so general, which admits not some exception.
 - Like dogs in a wheel, birds in a cage, or squirrels in a chain, ambitious men still climb and climb, with great labor, and incessant anxiety, but never reach the top.
 - If you like not my writing, go read something else.
 - Melancholy can be overcome only by melancholy.
 - We can make mayors and officers every year, but not scholars.
 - Let thy fortune be what it will, â€™tis thy mind alone that makes thee poor or rich, miserable or happy.
