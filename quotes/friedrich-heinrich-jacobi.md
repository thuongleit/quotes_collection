 - To lay aside all prejudices, is to lay aside all principles. He who is destitute of principles is governed by whims.
 - What is there in man so worthy of honor and reverence as this, that he is capable of contemplating something higher than his own reason, more sublime than the whole universe- that Spirit which alone is self-subsis-tent, from which all truth proceeds, without which there is no truth?
 - It is not truth, justice, liberty, that men seek; they seek only themselves. â€“ And oh, that they knew how to seek themselves aright!
 - All governments are, to a certain extent, a treaty with the Devil.
