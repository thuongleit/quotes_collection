 - The eye is the window of the soul, the mouth the door. The intellect, the will, are seen in the eye; the emotions, sensibilities, and affections, in the mouth. The animals look for man’s intentions right into his eyes. Even a rat, when you hunt him and bring him to bay, looks you in the eye.
 - The eye is the window of the soul; even an animal looks for a man’s intentions right into his eyes.
 - Educate the heart. Let us have good men.
