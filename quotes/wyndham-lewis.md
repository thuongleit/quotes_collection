 - The art of advertisement, after the American manner, has introduced into all our life such a lavish use of superlatives, that no standard of value whatever is intact.
 - Satire has a great big glaring target. If successful, it blasts a great big hole in the center. Directness there must be and singleness of aim: it is all aim, all trajectory.

 - People are so overwhelmed with the prestige of their instruments that they consider their personal judgement of hardly any account.
 - The male has been persuaded to assume a certain onerous and disagreeable role with the promise of rewards – material and psychological. Women may in the first place even have put it into his head.

 - A hundred things are done today in the divine name of Youth, that if they showed their true colors would be seen by rights to belong rather to old age.
 - Men were only made into ‘men’ with great difficulty even in primitive society: the male is not naturally ‘a man’ any more than the woman. He has to be propped up into that position with some ingenuity, and is always likely to collapse.
 - The ideal of perfect Success is an ideal belonging to the same sort of individual as the inventor of Equal Rights of man and Perfectibility.

 - Artists put as much vitality and delight into their saintliness and escape out as most men do their escapes into similar places from respectable existence.
 - Almost anything that can be praised or advocated has been put to some disgusting use. There is no principle, however immaculate, that has not had its compromising manipulator.
