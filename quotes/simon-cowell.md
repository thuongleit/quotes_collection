 - The best way to kill someone is from the inside, by crushing their hopes and dreams.
 - Good is not enough. You’ve got to be great.

 - You don’t hate the mosquito; you just want it out of your face.
 - I’ve had Botox, but then again pretty much everyone I know has. To me, Botox is no more unusual than toothpaste. It works. You do it once a year – who cares?

 - I was so tired, wasn’t having fun any more, and wasn’t sure if I wanted to do this any longer. So I turned my phone off and sorted my head out. It was the opposite of a breakdown really, it was a break-up – I got rid of all the idiots, realised my job was supposed to be fun, and got on with my life.
 - You sounded like someone who should be singing on a cruise ship. Halfway through your song, I wished the ship was sinking.
 - I couldn’t think of anything worse than being in an unhappy marriage. It worries me because I’ve seen it destroy people.

 - It was like orderin a hamburger and getting only the buns.

 - I suggest we bring some normality back to this country and say if you are carrying a knife, there must be zero tolerance. If it was up to me, everyone caught with a knife would get an automatic ten year sentence.
 - Anything I shouldn’t laugh at makes me laugh. I mean, I’m bad at that, when somebody is singing something terribly and I’m thinking to myself, ‘If I laugh now, this is the absolute worst thing I could ever do,’ and then I start laughing and I can’t stop.
 - I have always hated celebrities lecturing people on politics. So forgive me. But I am passionate about this country. I am equally passionate about the potential of the people who live here.
 - If you’ve got a big mouth and you’re controversial, you’re going to get attention.

 - Whether they run a record company or a grocery store, every boss will tell you you’re in big trouble if you’re borrowing more than you can ever afford to pay back. Delaying the pain for future generations is suicidal. We’ve got to start getting the deficit down right now, not next year.

 - You always want to go to a party where you get an invite.
 - At 20, you’re cocky and you think you can rule the world, and you get it all wrong.
 - I don’t have sophisticated tastes. I have average tastes. If you looked in my collection of DVDs, you’d see ‘Jaws’ and ‘Star Wars.’ In the book library, you’d see John Grisham and Sidney Sheldon. And if you look in my fridge, it’s, like, children’s food – chips, milkshakes, yogurt.
 - Beyonce is good-looking. Jennifer Lopez is good-looking. Madonna used to be good-looking.

 - Anyone who goes on ‘The X Factor’ to make big money will be in for a big shock.
 - They understand what their market is and who they should be selling records to, and most importantly, they know the kind of artist that they want to be, but they have to do it themselves. You don’t want a 13-year-old singing some awful song from a musical.

 - I think that by ignoring the show you’re ignoring the audience who put you there.
 - I don’t want to tell a 15 or 14 year old what they should be doing. I want them to tell me. And that’s what I got when I met Justin Bieber for the first time.

 - Normally if I go to one of these things I’m in and out in five minutes, but at Pride of Britain I stay to the end. It’s a fantastic show. But it’s incredibly hard on the night when you meet all the kids and hear their stories. They do get to you.
 - What I’m interested in watching is to make sure that they give the right advice now to the contestants who are going forward because, you know, it’s one thing just to criticize but you’ve got to also give, you know, good advice which is going to help them. Overall, I think they’re a good panel.

 - My own saying is: ‘Create the hype, but don’t ever believe it.’

 - Money brings you security and choice. You can make decisions in a different way if you have a lot of money. But when you have nothing, you have a naivety, and a more fearless attitude because you have nothing to lose.
 - I want people to understand that from the minute Lady Gaga arrived, she created a new set of rules: being different is good; embrace it.

 - There’s no need for me to get married. I live with someone; we’re happy; end of story.

 - Rules equal boredom, and I don’t like that.

 - I’ve never liked the idea you have to be a certain age to be a pop star. I like the idea that anybody can enter, anybody can compete.

 - I was living life like in one of those Disney movies, where I genuinely believed nobody was ever going to die.
