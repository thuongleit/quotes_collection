 - What is beyond the mind, has no boundary, In it our senses end.
 - Some praise me, some blame me. I go the other way.
 - I know a cure for sadness: Let our hands touch something that makes your eyes smile.
 - I went to the root of things, and found nothing but Him alone.
 - He lives century after century, and the test I set for him he has passed.
 - O my companion, Worldly comfort is an illusion, As soon you get it, it goes.
 - Donâ€™t forget love; it will bring you all the madness you need to unfurl yourself across the universe.
 - If living on fruits and water is of superior merit, monkeys and fish will go to heaven before men.
