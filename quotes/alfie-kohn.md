 - Learning is something students do, NOT something done to students.
 - Trying to be number one and trying to do a task well are two different things.
 - We can’t value only what is easy to measure; measurable outcomes may be the least important results of learning.
 - Saying you taught it but the student didn’t learn it is like saying you sold it but the customer didn’t buy it.

 - Punishments erode relationships and moral growth.
 - Being a team player should not imply a demand for simple obedience and conformity.
 - To feel controlled is to lose interest.
 - Grades are a subjective rating masquerading as an objective evaluation.
 - To be well-educated is to have the desire as well as the means to make sure that learning never ends.
 - In education, parody is obsolete.
 - Do rewards motivate people? Absolutely. They motivate people to get rewards.
 - People will typically be more enthusiastic where they feel a sense of belonging and see themselves as part of a community than they will in a workplace in which each person is left to his own devices.
 - Unconditional parenting: Moving from Rewards and Punishments to Love and Reason.
 - The late W. Edwards Deming, guru of Quality management, once declared, ‘The most important things we need to manage can’t be measured.’ If that’s true of what we need to manage, it should be even more obvious that it’s true of what we need to teach.
 - Social psychology has found the more you reward people for doing something, the more they tend to lose interest in whatever they had to do to get the reward.
 - To control students is to force them to accommodate to a preestablished curriculum.
 - In outstanding classrooms, teachers do more listening than talking, and students do more talking than listening. Terrific teachers often have teeth marks on their tongues.
 - Don’t let anyone tell you that standardized tests are not accurate measures. The truth of the matter is they offer a remarkably precise method for gauging the size of the houses near the school where the test was administered.
 - Punishments and rewards are two sides of the same coin and that coin doesn’t buy you much.
 - Students should not only be trained to live in a democracy when they grow up; they should have the chance to live in one today.

 - Maximum difficulty isn’t the same as optimal difficulty.
 - Standardized testing has swelled and mutated, like a creature in one of those old horror movies, to the point that it now threatens to swallow our schools whole.
 - A preoccupation with achievement is not only different from, but often detrimental to, a focus on learning. Thoughts and emotions while performing an action are more important in determining subsequent engagement than the actual outcome of that action.
 - We have so much to cover and so little time to cover it. Howard Gardner refers to curriculum coverage as the single greatest enemy of understanding. Think instead about ideas to be discovered.
 - Independence is useful, but caring attitudes and behaviors shrivel up in a culture where each person is responsible only for himself.
 - There are different kinds of motivation, and the kind matters more than the amount.
 - If rewards do not work, what does? I recommend that employers pay workers well and fairly and then do everything possible to help them forget about money. A preoccupation with money distracts everyone – employers and employees – from the issues that really matter.
 - Assessments should compare the performance of students to a set of expectations, never to the performance of other students.
 - If unconditional love and genuine enthusiasm are present, praise isn’t necessary. If they’re absent, praise won’t help.
 - When was the last time you spent the entire day with only 42 year olds?
 - You have to give them unconditional love. They need to know that even if they screw up, you love them. You don’t want them to grow up and resent you or, even worse, parent the way you parented them.

 - When test scores go up, we should worry, because of how poor a measure they are of what matters, and what you typically sacrifice in a desperate effort to raise scores.
 - Those who know they’re valued irrespective of their accomplishments often end up accomplishing quite a lot. It’s the experience of being accepted without conditions that helps people develop a healthy confidence in themselves, a belief that it’s safe to take risks and try new things.
 - Grades dilute the pleasure that a student experiences on successfully completing a task.
 - When we do things that are controlling, whether intentional or not, we are not going to get those long-term outcomes.
 - If faculty would relax their emphasis on grades, this might serve not to lower standards but to encourage an orientation toward learning.

 - Educators remind us that what counts in a classroom is not what the teacher teaches; it’s what the learner learns.
 - What can we surmise about the likelihood of someone’s being caring and generous, loving and helpful, just from knowing that they are a believer? Virtually nothing, say psychologists, sociologists, and others who have studied that question for decade.
 - We learn most readily, most naturally, most effectively, when we start with the big picture – precisely when the basics don’t come first.
 - How we feel about our kids isn’t as important as how they experience those feelings and how they regard the way we treat them.
