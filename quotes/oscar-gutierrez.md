 - I want to take the time right now to thank all the people who believed in me from day one. Gracias, gracias a todo gente creo en me. You know, I can prove that dreams do come true. I’m living proof that dreams come true in life.
 - But I want you to know, and I want you to have it very clear that I did NOT quit on each and everyone of you. No. Because you guys have never quitted on me.
