 - I am neither accusing President Obama of having committed high crimes and misdemeanors nor advocating his impeachment.

 - A president who believed that America’s greatness is recoverable and expandable – a chief executive determined to lead us back to national restoration – would reject the crippling notions of national impotency that Obama has embraced.
 - When the coercive power of government is used to equalize incomes, it guarantees less prosperity across the board and spreads the misery, which is one of the many reasons Marxism and socialism have failed everywhere they’ve tried.
 - Despite his profound incompetence on many levels, Obama has been an adept propagandist who has blamed capitalism for problems caused and magnified by socialist remedies to justify further socialist solutions. He’s now doing the same thing all over again as his new socialist solutions are failing.

 - Obama is a human wrecking ball single-handedly destroying our economy and bankrupting the nation.
 - The political left, which holds itself as progressive, rational and fact-based, is becoming an enemy of academic inquiry, and a practitioner of thought control on a wide variety of issues. Increasingly, from the left’s perspective, there is just one acceptable viewpoint.
 - Instead of using this space to pretend the newly released CIA ‘torture’ report confirms that the United States is the most evil nation in the history of the universe, I’m going to address Jonathan Gruber’s confirmation that he believes we’re all stupid.
 - Obama’s personality traits, coupled with his extreme-leftist agenda, make him particularly dangerous to the American ideal and to the preservation of our founding principles, as well as to the liberty and prosperity they guarantee.
 - The unmistakable lesson is that such is the myopic zealotry of environmentalists like Obama that they would implement policies virtually guaranteed to harm our economy significantly, even when they offer no promise of appreciable environmental benefits.
 - If Republican legislators succumb to their political addiction to compromise for the sake of getting something passed, no matter how odious, they’ll be laying out the red carpet of inevitability for socialized care.

 - Obama is ratcheting up his class warfare to levels that would make Marxists blush.
 - According to Gallup, Obama has already lost support among Jewish voters, down from 78 percent to 68 percent. If Romney shows that he is genuinely committed to Israel and that Obama is not, he’ll make further inroads.
 - Obama and his Democrats need to be placed on the defensive. They are the primary drivers of this spending; they are the obstructers of entitlement reform and the national debt continues to burn while they fiddle.
 - Obama liberals, in their incalculable arrogance, believe they are smart enough to defy everything we know about human nature, economics and history by insisting on separating financial efforts from rewards and pretending this can bring prosperity.
 - Liberals insist they believe as strongly in the American dream as the rest of us, but routinely demonize those who succeed in attaining it. They loudly profess their allegiance to capitalism, but resent the inequitable money results it produces.
 - Any concerns that Romney will adopt McCain’s milquetoast campaign model are quickly diminishing.
 - Republicans are already on seriously thin ice, having presided over an era of unprecedented spending and consistently failing to articulate conservative principles on a wide variety of issues. But what Obama has in store will make President Bush appear, in retrospect, like a libertarian.
 - Though there are many differences between Barack Obama and Jimmy Carter, they are strikingly similar in their poor economic records and even more so in their shared pessimism and bearishness on America.
