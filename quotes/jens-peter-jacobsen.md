 - Break the ice, or draw that which lives in the dimness out into the full light of speech â€“ what happens is the same: that which is now seen and now grasped is not, in its clearness, the shadowy thing that was.
 - Love is like a diamond; for as a diamond is beautiful to look upon, so is love fair, but as the diamond is poison to any one who swallows it, in the same manner love is a kind of poison and produces a baneful raging distemper in those who are infected by it.
