 - Growth comes from activity, not from intellectual understanding.
 - The human hand allows the mind to reveal itself.
 - Teach by teaching, not by correcting.

 - To teach details is to bring confusion; to establish the relationship between things is to bring knowledge.
 - Growth is not merely a harmonious increase in size, but a transformation.
 - Do not tell them how to do it. Show them how to do it and do not say a word. If you tell them, they will watch your lips move. If you show them, they will want to do it themselves.

 - The child is both a hope and a promise for mankind.

 - Culture and education have no bounds or limits; now man is in a phase in which he must decide for himself how far he can proceed in the culture that belongs to the whole of humanity.

 - Our aim is not merely to make the child understand, and still less to force him to memorize, but so to touch his imagination as to enthuse him to his innermost core.
 - To let the child do as he likes when he has not yet developed any powers of control is to betray the idea of freedom.
 - The child has a mind able to absorb knowledge. He has the power to teach himself.

 - As soon as children find something that interests them they lose their instability and learn to concentrate.
 - Concentration is the key that opens up to the child the latent treasures within him.
 - First the education of the senses, then the education of the intellect.
 - Mental development must be connected with movement and be dependent on it. It is vital that educational theory and practice should be informed by that idea.
 - It is exactly in the repetition of the exercises that the education of the senses exists; not that the child shall know colors, forms or qualities, but that he refine his senses through an exercise of attention, comparison and judgment.
 - There should be music in the child’s environment, just as there does exist in the child’s environment spoken speech. In the social environment the child should be considered and music should be provided.
 - To assist a child we must provide him with an environment which will enable him to develop freely.
 - Only practical work and experience lead the young to maturity.
 - We cannot create observers by saying ‘observe,’ but by giving them the power and the means for this observation and these means are procured through education of the senses.

 - Joy is the evidence of inner growth.
 - The role of education is to interest the child profoundly in an external activity to which he will give all his potential.

 - Watch the unending activity of the flowing stream or the growing tree. See the breakers of the ocean, the unceasing movements of the earth, the planets, the sun and the stars. All creation is life, movement, work.
 - Our care of the child should be governed, not by the desire to make him learn things, but by the endeavor always to keep burning within him that light which is called intelligence.
 - When the child goes out, it is the world itself that offers itself to him. Let us take the child out to show him real things instead of making objects which represent ideas and closing them up in cupboards.
 - To stimulate life, leaving it then free to develop, to unfold, herein lies the first task of the teacher.
 - If we really want children to grow into independent and resourceful adults, we should stop pouring their milk as soon as they have learned to pour it themselves and stop fastening their buttons as soon as they can fasten them without help.

 - The teacher’s task is not to talk, but to prepare and arrange a series of motives for cultural activity in a special environment made for the child.
 - Beauty lies in harmony, not in contrast; and harmony is refinement; therefore, there must be a fineness of the senses if we are to appreciate harmony.
 - The adult works to improve his environment while the child works to improve himself.
 - Preventing war is the work of politicians, establishing peace is the work of educationists.
 - The ancient saying, “There is nothing in the intellect which was not first in some way in the senses,” and senses being explorers of the world, opens the way to knowledge.
 - My vision of the future is no longer of people taking exams and proceeding from secondary school to University but of passing from one stage of independence to a higher, by means of their own activity and effort of will.

 - It is almost possible to say that there is a mathematical relationship between the beauty of his surroundings and the activity of the child; he will make discoveries rather more voluntarily in a gracious setting than in an ugly one.
 - It is well to cultivate a friendly feeling towards error, to treat it as a companion inseparable from our lives, as something having a purpose, which it truly has.
 - A child is a discoverer. He is an amorphous, splendid being in search of his own proper form.
 - If help and salvation are to come, they can only come from the children, for the children are the makers of men.
 - All our handling of the child will bear fruit, not only at the moment, but in the adult they are destined to become.

 - Free choice is one of the highest of all the mental processes.
 - We teachers can only help the work going on, as servants wait upon a master.
 - The secret of good teaching is to regard the child’s intelligence as a fertile field in which seeds may be sown, to grow under the heat of flaming imagination.

 - It is the child who makes the man, and no man exists who was not made by the child he once was.
 - To have a vision of the cosmic plan, in which every form of life depends on directed movements which have effects beyond their conscious aim, is to understand the child’s work and be able to guide it better.
 - The development of the child during the first three years after birth is unequaled in intensity and importance by any period that precedes or follows in the whole life of the child.
 - The concept of an education centered upon the care of the living being alters all previous ideas. Resting no longer on a curriculum, or a timetable, education must conform to the facts of human life.
 - To give a child liberty is not to abandon him to himself.
 - Do not erase the designs the child makes in the soft wax of his inner life.
 - The child is endowed with unknown powers, which can guide us to a radiant future. If what we really want is a new world, then education must take as its aim the development of these hidden possibilities.
 - The instructions of the teacher consist then merely in a hint, a touch-enough to give a start to the child. The rest develops of itself.
 - Rewards and punishments, to speak frankly, are the desk of the soul, that is, a means of enslaving a child’s spirit, and better suited to provoke than to prevent deformities.

 - A new education from birth onwards must be built up. Education must be reconstructed and based on the law of nature and not on the preconceived notions and prejudices of adult society.
 - But if for the physical life it is necessary to have the child exposed to the vivifying forces of nature, it is also necessary for his psychical life to place the soul of the child in contact with creation.

 - Watching a child makes it obvious that the development of his mind comes through his movements.

 - The greatest step forward in human evolution was made when society began to help the weak and the poor, instead of oppressing and despising them.
 - There is in the child a special kind of sensitivity which leads him to absorb everything about him, and it is this work of observing and absorbing that alone enables him to adapt himself to life.
 - Except when he has regressive tendencies, the child’s nature is to aim directly and energetically at functional independence.
 - No one can be free unless he is independent. Therefore, the first active manifestations of the child’s individual liberty must be so guided that through this activity he may arrive at independence.

 - The best instruction is that which uses the least words sufficient for the task.
