 - I’m a fanatic about Irish music. I love its moody, modal and timeless quality. I’m different from some other composers, because I don’t look at this as just a job. I think of music as art.
 - I am a musicologist, a doctor of music. Therefore I listened to, studied and analysed a lot of music. I also enjoy metaphors, the art of quoting and of cycles.
 - I’m sure that I was influenced by Goldsmith’s large orchestral scores when I started out, and that was because the people who employed me wanted that kind of sound. I wasn’t in a position to say, ‘Go to Hell!’
