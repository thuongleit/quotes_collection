 - When I chop wood, I chop wood. When I carry water, I carry water.
 - The past is already past. Don’t try to regain it. The present does not stay. Don’t try to touch it from moment to moment. The future has not come. Don’t think about it beforehand.
 - My daily affairs are quite ordinary; but I’m in total harmony with them. I don’t hold on to anything, don’t reject anything; nowhere an obstacle or conflict. Who cares about wealth and honor? Even the poorest thing shines. My miraculous power and spiritual activity: drawing water and carrying wood.
 - How wondrously supernatural, And how miraculous this! I draw water, and I carry fuel.
 - I beg you, cease going from lecture to lecture; It’s better to seek truth directly. The nature of Diamond Wisdom excludes even a speck of dust. From “Thus we have heard,” to “This I believe,” All is but an array of unreal names.
 - How miraculous and wondrous, hauling water and carrying firewood!
