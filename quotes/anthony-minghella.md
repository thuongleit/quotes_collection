 - The problem with growing up in a cafe was the cafe never closed, my parents worked every day of the year from morning to night. So it was a big menagerie of kids, business and cooking!
 - You know, you lose a lot of social skills if you’re a writer. You spend too long alone. And it’s forced me to address that.
