 - The woman of tomorrow will be efficacious, seductive and without contest superior to man. It is for this woman that I conceive my designs.
 - Say goodbye to the age-old stereotypes of seduction. Seductive, but not a seductress, a woman wears a scent to reveal her personality.
 - I wanted to make a concrete impression; the idea of a woman that is free, moody, never the object, one that has a complete control of her finances and knows how it is to be independent.
