 - There’s still time to change the road you’re on.
 - You know sometimes words have two meanings.
 - Does anyone remember laughter?
 - Music means communication to me. I say ‘listen you people out there, listen to my music, let’s be one.’ Music is a friend to me when I am lonely, when I am blue. You can’t define music ’cause music is cosmos and it knows no barrier or definition. You have to feel music to dig it.
 - As we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our souls.
 - There’s nothing new under the sun – you just get a can of paint out.

 - When you’re 20 years old and you’re making points with volume and dynamism, it’s a fantastic thing to do.
 - I absolutely adore and idolise women. All women. I think they are all amazing. The female musicians I’ve met have been far more inspiring than the male ones. Women tend to be much more creative and ambitious. I think I may have been a woman in a past life.
 - Kashmir is my last resort. I think, if I truly deserve it one day, I should go there and stay there for quite a while. Or if I really need it at any point, it should be my haven, my Shangri-la.
 - My mother was a gypsy, and she had a lot of dark blood in her, and her hair was very, very thick – she couldn’t even get a brush through it. So I have been very fortunate. And every time I go to cut it off, hairdressers refuse to do it.
 - Life is life. You do a lot of different things and you have great adventures but there’s not a lot to talk about unless you’re in the middle of an adventure at the time. Circumspection is not one of my better, favorite conditions, really.
 - How much do people really want to learn? I mean, some people get into a groove and they stay with it indefinitely. And what starts off as a great moment of explosive passion can end up as cabaret 25, 30 years later. It just depends on whether you go and find the right habitat to extend yourself.
 - You can’t give up something you really believe in for financial reasons. If you die by the roadside – so be it. But at least you know you’ve tried. Ten minutes in the music scene was the equal of one hundred years outside of it.
 - I’m so aware of the fact that if I hadn’t taken the chances that I’ve taken along the line, I probably wouldn’t be getting the best out of my voice anymore, I might have messed it up in that awful, predictable place.
 - I’ve stopped apologizing to myself for having this great period of success and financial acceptance.
 - You have to ask these questions: who pays the piper, and what is valuable in this life?
 - I daresay one good concert justifies a week of satisfaction at home.
 - Old men do it better. We’re not so sensitive in certain areas.
 - People run away, pull their hair, go off in different directions, nodding their heads and going, “Oh, God.” I am slightly disheveled, I think. I’m really pleased that I am, because otherwise I could be in a really, really dull and boring place now, as a musician, at least.
 - I’m not a sad old hippie – I’m a joyous old hippie.
 - Don’t be hard on yourself. And take as many chances, risks, as you can.
 - You can’t even imagine how it felt to have a cassette that you could take with you with a microphone so you could put down an idea and not have to hum it a million times to remember what it was.
 - I like the idea of being alone. I like the idea of often being alone in all aspects of my life. I like to feel lonely. I like to need things.
 - I’m not saving lives. I’m singing and I should go placidly and joyously through the whole thing and work hard and not take it for granted. It’s great to have this gift.
 - Yeah, I think the point has well and truly sunk in by now, and I can just carry on. I don’t even know what I’m looking for except a bit of hilarity and mild insanity musically, and I can get none of that by just delving into the history.
 - I can’t moan about any of it. I had a great time in the goldfish bowl.
 - I love the feeling of letting fly, of pushing as far as I could go with my voice. The only way you can really graduate how you do it is by doing it regularly to people who don’t have to be super impressed. You can do it in the studio all day long but you don’t get the flashback that you get onstage.
 - Don’t be hard on yourself. And take as many chances, risks, as you can. You’ve got to be out there adventuring with the voice. Because if you’re just a singer for the sake of it, it’s not quite enough.
 - I’ve still got a twinkle in me.
 - Life isn’t moving quickly; time moves very quickly. But I don’t really have a schedule now that’s very challenging. I make the calls and I call the shots, so I feel reasonably centered. Sometimes, I wonder whether or not it’s even necessary to do concerts and stuff.

 - I don’t see what the point is in growing up.
 - There’s no comparison between the most precious parts of one’s personal life and success and wealth. If you lost someone near and dear to you, you can’t relate it to any amount of fame, fortune and luxury. You just have to go on living.
 - It’s funny, you know, time does travel pretty quickly and I do have good friends, and the further away I go from them in location, it matters that I keep on the same line and the same groove that I had and preserve that groove with people who I see seldom.

 - I am a reflection of what I sing. Sometimes I have to get serious because the things Ive been through are serious.

 - I’m tipping the hat and looking back.
 - Lately, I’m spending more and more time working with non-rock musicians and leaving the mainstream – almost dissolving into another world, musically.
 - I kind of disguise my limitations by hanging out with very talented people. The excitement of the collision between the microphone-twirling guy from 1966 to now is just a fantastic adventure. There aren’t many of us left and I’ve managed to kind of cover my tracks pretty good.
 - You feel quite distant by playing at huge stadiums year after year, where you only can see a great darkness in front of you.
 - The trouble is now, with rock’n’roll and stuff, it gets so big that it loses what once upon a time was a magnificent thing, where it was special and quite elusive and occasionally a little sinister and it had its own world nobody could get in.
 - So for a long time I closed my eyes to the possibility of America having a white voice.
