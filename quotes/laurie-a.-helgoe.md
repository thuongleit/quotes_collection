 - Introverts keep their best stuff inside – that is, until it is ready. And this drives extroverts crazy! The explanation for the introvert’s behavior – and there must be an explanation for this behavior, say the extroverts – is that he or she is antisocial, out of touch, or simply a snob.
 - When an introvert cares about someone, she also wants contact, not so much to keep up with the events of the other person’s life, but to keep up with what’s inside: the evolution of ideas, values, thoughts, and feelings.
