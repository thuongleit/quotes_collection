 - I am a firm believer in serendipity- all the random pieces coming together in one wonderful moment, when suddenly you see what their purpose was all along.
 - You don’t know me. You know one me, just like I know one you. And you can’t know every me, and I can’t know every you.
 - It would be too easy to say that I feel invisible. Instead, I feel painfully visible, and entirely ignored.
 - Music is everywhere. It’s in the air between us, waiting to be sung.
 - I am constantly torn between killing myself and killing everyone around me.
 - She is my first and only love. Most people know that their first love will not be their only love. But for me, she is both.
 - You are so close, and I can’t reach you.
 - If you stare at the center of the universe, there is coldness there. A blankness. Ultimately, the universe doesn’t care about us. Time doesn’t care about us. That’s why we have to care about each other.
 - She is so lost in her sadness that she has no idea how visible it is.
 - There are all these moments you don’t think you will survive. And then you survive.
 - Every day I am someone else. I am myself-I know I am myself-but I am also someone else. It has always been like this.
 - Things that matter are not easy. Feelings of happiness are easy. Happiness is not. Flirting is easy. Love is not. Saying you’re friends is easy. Being friends is not.
 - I wake up thinking of yesterday. The joy is in remembering; the pain is in knowing it was yesterday.
 - Honestly, I’m just trying to live day to day.
 - You spend so much time, so much effort, trying to hold yourself together. And then everything falls apart anyway.
 - I am proud that I defy your categories. I am proud that I don’t fit easily into any box. I am proud of all the things I am and all the things i can be. Question yourself every time you think you only see one thing in me.
 - A sound waiting to be a word.
 - Her mind is an unquiet one, words and thoughts and impulses constantly crashing into each other.
 - What separates us from the animals, what separates us from the chaos, is our ability to mourn people we’ve never met.
 - And If only I could, I’d make a deal with God...
 - Because when something happens, she’s the person I want to tell. The most basic indicator of love.
 - Love me less, but love me for a long time.
 - Love is so painful, how could you ever wish it on anybody? And love is so essential, how could you ever stand in its way?
 - You like him because he’s a lost boy. Believe me, I’ve seen it happen before. But do you know what happens to girls who love lost boys? They become lost themselves. Without fail.
 - Ignorance is not bliss. Bliss is knowing the full meaning of what you have been given.
 - I want love to conquer all. But love can’t conquer anything. It can’t do anything on it’s own. It relies on us to do the conquering on its behalf.
 - Kindness connects to who you are, while niceness connects to how you want to be seen.
 - You think you know your possibilities. Then other people come into your life and suddenly there are so many more.
 - If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: We all want everything to be okay. We don’t even wish so much for fantastic or marvelous or outstanding. We will happily settle for okay, because most of the time, okay is enough.
 - Love is the higher law.
 - Fate has a strange way of making plans.
 - There is no word for our kind of friendship. Two people who don’t see each other a lot, but can make each other effortlessly happy.
 - There will always be more questions. Every answer leads to more questions. The only way to survive is to let some of them go.
 - If you let the world in, you open yourself up to the world. Even if the world doesn’t know that you’re there.
 - People say that time slips through our fingers like sand. What they don’t acknowledge is that some of the sand sticks to the skin. These are memories that will remain, memories of the time when there was still time left.
 - Life goes on. Get over it. You’re still young. It’ll get better. Blah, Blah, Blah.
 - Dullness is the spice of life. Which is why we must always use other spices.
 - The way you’re singing in your sleep The way you look before you leap The strange illusions that you keep You don’t know But I’m noticing The way your touch turns into arcs The way you slide into the dark The beating of my open heart You don’t know But I’m noticing.
 - Remember that at any given moment there are a thousand things you can love.
 - The minute I knew I was in love was the minute when there was no question about it.
 - It’s one thing to fall in love. It’s another to feel someone else fall in love with you, and to feel a responsibility toward that love.
 - Breathing is hard. When you cry so much, it makes you realize that breathing is hard.
 - When I am with you, there is nowhere else I’d rather be. And I am a person who always wants to be somewhere else.
 - You leave the phone on beside you as you fall asleep. I sit in my bed and listen to your breathing, until I know you are safe, until I know you no longer need me for the night.
 - Yesterday is another world. I want to go back there.
 - The important people in our lives leave imprints. They may stay or go in the physical realm, but they are always there in your heart, because they helped form your heart. There’s not getting over that.
 - Once time is lit, it will burn whether or not you’re breathing it in. Even after smoke becomes air, there is the memory of smoke. I am seeing as if by the light of a match, a glimpse of my life and having it feel right.
 - I no longer think she’s just being nice. She’s being kind. Which is much more a sign of character than mere niceness. Kindness connects to who you are, while niceness connects to how you want to be seen.
 - Self-preservation isn’t worth it if you can’t live with the self you’re preserving.
 - I want you to be honest with me. Even if it hurts. Although I would prefer for it not to hurt.
 - You wanna-I dunno-get coffee or something sometime?
 - I feel the universe is telling me something. And it doesn’t even matter if it’s true or not. What matters is that I feel it, and believe it.
 - To get something you must give something away. To hold something you must give something away. To love something you must give something away.
 - I am a drifter, and as lonely as that can be, it is also remarkably freeing. I will never define myself in terms of anyone else.
 - I have learned how to observe, far better than most people observe. I am not blinded by the past or motivated by the future. I focus on the present, because that is where I am destined to live.
 - Do not just seek happiness for yourself. Seek happiness for all. Through kindness. Through mercy.
 - I get it. The things you hope for the most are the things that destroy you in the end.
 - If other people see you differently, you’ll end up seeing them differently, too.
 - I know the odds are all against me and I know you might not feel this way too but I know I would rather die trying to know if I could mean something to you.
 - I’m not good at relationships I always manage to find the flaws sometimes in others but mostly my own. I foretell the ending then go and create the cause save myself and end up alone.
 - That’s what the voices in your head are for, to get you through the silent parts.
 - Which is more stubborn, the love or the two arguing people caught within it?
 - I only have eyes for you.
 - The world, right now, is only us.
 - Its a fine line between love and stalking.
 - If I lose it now, I will lose you, too. I know that. I hate it.
 - Without you I wouldn’t have been able to contain the hate. I would have used it against myself. You’re the one who helped me control it. My mind spun out to other things. But it always came back to you.
 - And who am I to blow against the wind?
 - The clock always ticks. There are times you don’t hear it, and there are times that you do.
 - I should talk to him I know I should talk to him. But I do not talk to him. I watch after him from afar and love him.
 - Let’s always love each other, and never be in love with each other.
 - I am breathing. In dreams, we never bother to breathe.
 - Make more than dust.
 - What I learned The well-documented difference Between alone and lonely The comfort of knowing.
 - He has no idea how beautiful the ordinary becomes once it disappears.
 - My mother said I should have a ‘change of scenery.’ The word scenery made be think of a play. And as we were driving around, it made sense that way. Because no matter how much the scenery changed, we were still on the same stage.
 - You want meaning? Well, the meanings are out there. We’re just so damn good at reading them wrong.
 - It’s the way you say thank you like you’re genuinely thankful. I have never met anyone else who does that on a regular basis.
 - Maybe language is kind, giving us these double meanings. Maybe it’s trying to teach us a lesson, that we can always be two things at once.
 - I guess I don’t believe these things can ever be easy, although I also don’t see why they have to be hard.
 - Even if neither of us got what we wanted, we found freedom in the third choices.
 - The tenderness between two people can turn the air tender, the room tender, time itself tender. As I step out of bed and slip on an oversize shirt, everything around me feels like it’s the temperature of happiness.
 - The words that matter always stay.
 - This is as much a part of my story as anything else. Friendship is love as much as any romance.
 - Answerless questions can destroy you. Move on.
 - We switch to another language – not our invented language or the language we’ve learned from our lives. As we walk further up the mountain, we speak the language of silence. This language gives us time to think and move. We can be here and elsewhere at the same time.
 - Every relationship has a hard part at the beginning. This is our hard part. It’s not like a puzzle piece where there’s an instant fit. With relationships, you have to shape the pieces on each end before they go perfectly together.
 - This is the thing they don’t tell you about being a third wheel – it’s not like you’re the wheel that’s added on. You were one of the original two wheels, but suddenly you’re not so important anymore. The relationship drives fine without you.
 - I feel my life is so scattered right now. Like it’s all these small pieces of paper and someone’s turned on the fan. But talking to you makes me feel like the fan’s been turned off for a little bit. Like things could actually make sense. You completely unscatter me, and I appreciate that so much.
 - The mistake is thinking that there can be an antidote to the uncertainty.
 - You can’t know what it is like for us now – you will always be one step behind. Be thankful for that. You can’t know what it was like for us then – you will always be one step ahead. Be thankful for that, too.
 - Life tells you to take the elevator, but love tells you to take the stairs.
 - If you zoom close-if you get really close to someone, if you really get close to yourself-then you lose the other person, you lose yourself entirely. You get so close you can’t see anything anymore.
 - That strange, twisted, torn love. That conflict between what your heart knows is right and what your mind is told is right.
 - I love you-I do-but I am afraid of making that love too important. Because you’re always going to leave me, A. We can’t deny it. You’re always going to leave.
 - I can see that the sadness has returned. And it’s not a beautiful sadness- beautiful sadness is a myth. Sadness turns our features to clay, not porcelain.
 - It scares me how hard it is to remember life before you. I can’t even make the comparisons anymore, because my memories of that time have all the depth of a photograph. It seems foolish to play games of better and worse. It’s simply a matter of is and is no longer.
 - It’s as if when you love someone, they become your reason.
 - Part of growing up is making sure your sense of reality isn’t entirely grounded in your own mind.
 - He was my first boyfriend, and I made him my everything – he was my new life, my new love, my new compass point. I guess that’s the danger with firsts – you lose all sense of proportion.
 - Once you experience enormity, it lingers everywhere you look, and want to be every word you say.
 - People often say that when couples are married for a long time, they start to look alike. I don’t believe that. But I do believe their sentences start to look alike.
 - Feeling someone else’s anger is bad; being left alone is worse.
 - It’s as simple as that. Simple and complicated, as most true things are.
 - I am learning that a life isn’t real unless someone else knows its reality. And I want my life to be real.
 - I am like the fish in the aquarium, thinking in a different language, adapting to a life that’s not my natural habitat. I am the people in the other cars, each with his or her own story, but passing too quickly to be noticed or understood.
 - But I guess you don’t see the planets when you’re staring at the sun. You just get blinded.
 - I had gotten so used to being alone, but never entirely used to it. Never used to it enough to stop wanting the alternative.
 - People take love’s continuity for granted, just as they take their body’s continuity for granted. They don’t realize that the best thing about love is its regular presence. Once you can establish that, it’s an added foundation to your life.
 - We found out a long time ago that we weren’t meant to fall in love with each other. But a part of me still fell in hope with him.
 - You know, I’d get a tattoo with your name on it. Only, I want you to have the freedom to change your name if you want to.
 - Deep down, you see, I long to be arcane, esoteric. I would love to confound people with their own language.
 - There is no such thing as no choice. There is always a choice. The only question is whether it’s a bearable one.
 - Love and I once had a great relationship, but I fear we’ve broken up. It cheated on me, wrecked my heart, and then went on to date other people. A lot of other people. And I can’t stand to watch it, since love’s going to cheat on them too.
 - We do not start as dust. We do not end as dust. We make more than dust. That’s all we ask of you. Make more than dust.
 - I never felt the urge to jump off a bridge, but there are times I have wanted to jump out of my life, out of my skin.
 - Are you going to be playing for the pure thrill of unreluctant desire?
 - It is very hard to stay alive just for your own sake. It is very hard to stare into day after day without another familiar face staring back. It turns your heart into a purposeless muscle.
 - Why do we feel the need to disconnect in order to connect?
 - As if when someone close to us dies, we momentarily trade places with them, in the moment right before. And as we get over it, we’re really living their life in reverse, from death to life, from sickness to health.
 - But I think we were walking around like we were invincible. And maybe that’s a bad way to live your life. Because you’re not invincible. Nobody is. And maybe now that we’ve learned that, we’ll be better.
 - Void is when there is absolutely nothing there and the nothing is natural, a complete vacuum. But empty – with empty, you are aware of what’s supposed to be there. Empty means something is missing.
 - The unwarranted devotion. Putting up with the fear of being with the wrong person because you can’t deal with the fear of being alone. The hope tinged with doubt, and the doubt tinged with hope. Every time I see these feelings in someone else’s face, it weighs me down.
 - Maybe, it’s not the distance that’s the problem, but how you handle it.
 - But I think we both knew, even then, that what we had was something even more rare, and even more meaningful. I was going to be his friend, and was going to show him possibilities. And he, in turn, would become someone I could trust more than myself.
 - In my experience, desire is desire, love is love. I have never fallen in love with a gender. I have fallen for individuals.
 - I was attempting to write the story of my life. It wasn’t so much about plot. It was much more about character.
 - Teens wanted things that were real, that they connected with, it doesn’t have to reflect reality directly. They love ‘The Hunger Games’ not because it’s real in that it happens, but the emotions there are real, and it’s very relatable.
 - But you have to figure that if it’s too hard to hang on, then maybe you should let go.
 - Belonging. Togetherness. These words are as complicated and confusing as the word love. It’s probably all the same thing. Or it would be if we let it be. I can only guess from observation.
 - It will affect me in ways I can’t even begin to get my mind around. This day is a dark crater. There is no room for songs. The songs are wrong. Every song is wrong. And I don’t know what to do without music.
 - I close my eyes. And i scream. If my whole world is crashing down around me, then I am going to make the sound of the crashing. I want to scream until all my bones break.
 - I am always amazed by people who know something is wrong but still insist on ignoring it, as if that will somehow make it go away. They spare themselves the confrontation, but end up boiling in resentment anyway.
 - How can you spend hours every day trying in small ways to figure out who you are, then have a near-stranger give you a sentence of yourself that says it better than you ever could?
 - I want to kiss her without counting the seconds. I want to hold her so long that I get to know her skin. I want, I want, I want.
 - Every you, every me. Fractals. Fractures.
 - My pride shut me up, my hurt shut me down, and together they ganged up on my hope and let her get away.
 - There are times when I worry that I’ve already lost myself. That is, that my self is so inseparable from being with you that if we were to separate, I would no longer be. I save this thought for when I feel the darkest discontent. I never meant to depend so much on someone else.
 - We pencil-sketch our previous life so we can contrast it to the technicolor of the moment.
 - And once again I think about how people use the devil as an alias for the things they fear. The cause and effect is backward. The devil doesn’t make anyone do anything. People just do things and blame the devil after.
 - I am stronger than words and I am bigger than the box I’m in, and then I see her in the crowd and I fall apart.
 - I am not dangerous. Only the stories are dangerous. Only the fictions we create, especially when they become expectations.
 - We are so used to releasing words, we don’t know what to do with them if they stay. No matter how many times we let them go, they come back. The words that matter always stay.
 - That’s the problem with having a moral code. We want to destroy the jerkish part of the jerks, but we want to save the human being underneath.
 - When I say, “Be my lover”, I don’t mean, “Let’s have an affair.” I don’t mean “Sleep with me.” I don’t mean, “Be my secret.” I want us to go back down to that root. I want you to be the one who loves me. I want to be the one who loves you.
 - And just like that, the universe goes wrong. Just like that, all the enormity seems to shrink into a ball and float away from my reach. I feel it, and she doesn’t. Or I feel it, and she won’t.
 - I had made it somewhere special, and I’d gotten there all on my own. Nobody had given it to me. Nobody had told me to do it. I’d climbed and climbed and climbed, and this was my reward. To watch over the world, and to be alone with myself. That, I found, was what I needed.
 - I don’t want you to think I got through this undamaged, okay? But I’m learning to live with it. Because otherwise, the damage is all you are.
 - A photograph it a souvenir of a memory. It is not a moment. It is the looking at the photograph that becomes the moment. Your own moment.
 - It was so much easier when I didn’t want anything. Not getting what you want can make you cruel.
 - I notice you, I want to say. Even when no one else does, I do. I will.
 - And as we drift into sleep, I feel something I’ve never felt before. A closeness that isn’t merely physical. A connection that defies the fact that we’ve only just met. A sensation that can only come from the most euphoric of feelings: belonging.
 - I don’t like it when you use my shampoo, because then your hair smells like me, not you.
 - I am jealous of anyone who can make other people care so much.
 - Making love without noise is like playing a muted piano-fine for practice, but you cheat yourself out of hearing the glorious results.
 - It’s only a game if there is an absence of meaning. And we’ve already gone too far for that.
 - Maybe there’s a way to keep us in this moment. Not the sad part. But the coming together part.
 - I try to be a careful person. Most of the time my carelessness is completely unintentional.
 - I want to believe there is a somebody out there just for me. I want to believe that I exist to be there for that somebody.
 - You never let things go unanswered for too long. Emails. Phone calls. Questions. As if you know the waiting is the hardest part for me.
 - There are boys so enraptured by love that they can’t get their hearts to slow down enough to get some rest, and other boys so damaged by love that they can’t stop picking at their pain.
 - The older I get, the more I lose my ability to breathe.
 - I want to write my life. I want to be able to write my life. You are a second away from saying it. You have no idea how much I love you.
 - When the shock wears off, you always hope there’s understanding underneath.
 - I still felt fondness for her – fondness, that pleasant, detached mix of admiration and sentiment, appreciation and nostalgia.
 - When you live as I do, you cannot indulge in jealousy. If you do, it will rip you apart.
 - Trying to write about love is ultimately like trying to have a dictionary represent life. No matter how many words there are, there will never be enough.
 - After tiny has tried ballerina pose, swing-batter-batter pose, pump-up-the-jam pose, and top-of-the-mountain-sound-of-music pose in the reflection of the bean, he walks us to a bench overlooking lake shore drive.
 - Sharing truth is not the kind of gift that comes in wrapping paper – ripped open once and, there, you’re done. No, this is a gift that must be unfolded.
 - I had forgotten this about love: how the simple things- the turn away, the turn towards- could be so complicated, and how the complicated things- the stolen night, the right words- could be so simple.
 - I know I should just leave. Just go. Because there’s a point where a mistake turns into a big mistake, and I should probably come to my senses before I get there.
 - I’ll see you later, he says, and as he does, he runs his finger briefly over my wrist. It passes over me like air, and makes me shiver like a kiss.
 - I want to take back at least half of the “I love you”s, because I didn’t mean them as much as the other ones.
 - If I’m not telling you something, it’s for a reason. Just because you trust me, it doesn’t mean I have to automatically trust you. Trust doesn’t work like that.
 - I don’t get this at all. It’s like protesting the fact that some people are red-haired.
 - You could be the leaf that never falls from the tree you could be the sun that never leaves the sky this might be the happy ending without the ending this might be a reason to try.
 - But I want to feel like life matters. I had something real with you, but then the realness scared me. I decided to go for other things instead.
 - But whether or not you are here, you are here – because these words are for you, and they wouldn’t exist if you weren’t here in some way.
 - You have to believe there are kisses and laughs and risks worth taking.
 - When someone breaks up with you, their beauty – which you took such satisfaction in – suddenly becomes unfair.
 - I learn about the highs and lows of living with the same mother for your entire life, about how no one can make you angrier, but how you can’t really love anyone more.
 - The way you argued with me, you would have thought that we were debating the existence of God or whether or not we should move in together. These kinds of fights can never be won – even if you’re the victor, you’ve hurt the other person, and there has to be some loss associated with that.
 - I find faith in human perseverance, even as the universe throws challenge after challenge our way.
 - People are rarely as attractive in reality as they are in the eyes of the people who are in love with them. Which is, I suppose, as it should be.
 - What a strange phrase – –not seeing other people. As if it’s been constructed to be a lie. We see other people all the time. The question is what we do about it.
 - Most people, I’ve noticed, are instinctively harsh to strangers. They expect every approach to be an attack, every question to be an interruption.
 - The assumption of the word reunion is that, once you’re together again, you are united. Two as one. Pulling close to someone is only a temporary symbol. It’s the way you breathe with each other that’s the telltale sign.
 - Little less than a promise, and a little more than a chance.
 - Eventually she fell asleep, but I kept the phone against my ear, lulled by her breathing, and her breathing again in the background. And yes, it felt like home. Like everything belonged exactly where it was.
 - We didn’t believe in fate, but we believed in serendipity. We felt very lucky.
 - Every single answer starts with the phrase ‘I don’t know.’ But most of the time she does know, if I give her the time and the space in which to answer.
 - When first love ends, most people eventually know there will be more to come. They are not through with love. Love is not through with them. It will never be the same as the first, but it will be better in different ways.
 - It is not desire. Instead it is something deeper. I don’t want to be with him constantly and forever. I want to be with him for the moment, and I want the moments to go on forever.
 - Some days are like this. And the only way to get through them is to remember that they are only one day, and that every day ends.
 - I am starting to get tired of relying on words.
 - Be careful what you’re doing, because no one is ever who you want them to be.
 - I can’t pretend to know what love is. It just is.
 - Deep down? That sounds like settling to me. You shouldn’t have to venture deep down in order to get to love.
 - Beauty comes naturally, but it’s hard to be stunning by accident.
 - I always think of each night as a song. Or each moment as a song. But now I’m seeing we don’t live in a single song. We move from song to song, from lyric to lyric, from chord to chord. There is no ending here. It’s an infinite playlist.
 - It is an awful thing to be betrayed by your body. And it’s lonely, because you feel you can’t talk about it.
 - We all contain mysteries, especially when seen from the inside.
 - It is hard to stop seeing your son as a son and to start seeing him as a human being. It is hard to stop seeing your parents as parents and to start seeing them as human beings. It’s a two-sided transition, and very few people manage it gracefully.
 - Sometimes desire is air, sometimes desire is liquid. And every now and then, when everything else is air and liquid, desire solidifies, and the body is the magnet that draws its weight.
 - Why do we even bother? Why do we make ourselves so open to such easy damage? Is it all loneliness? Is it all fear? Or is it just to experience those narcotic moments of belonging with someone else?
 - When we’re alone together, I’m the destination. When I’m here in her life at school, I’m the disruption.
 - I have taken advantage of other people’s weaknesses in order to cover my own.
 - Because sometimes you just have to dance like a madman in the Self-Help section of your local bookstore.
 - Every two people cause and intersection. Every person alters the world.
 - We stay this way until twilight colours the window and the hour calls me home.
 - She has been hanging on to the hope of him for so long that she doesn’t realize there isn’t anything left to hope for.
 - He’ll have to prove it to you. Every day, he’ll have to prove he’s worthy of you. And if he doesn’t, that’s it. But I think he will.
 - There is something so intimate about saying the truth out loud. There is something so intimate about hearing the truth said. There is something so intimate about sharing the truth, even if you are not entirely sure what it means.
 - All this hoping for something- or someone- that’s maybe hopeless. I’m having a hard time processing what I am supposed to believe, or if I’m even supposed to. There is too much information, and I don’t like a lot of it.
 - We always see our worst selves. Our most vulnerable selves. We need someone else to get close enough to tell us we’re wrong. Someone we trust.
 - The boy I just kissed is talking to my father. The boy I want to kiss again is waiting for my mother to serve pancakes. I must fight the urge to freak.
 - It feels like I am wasting time. I mean, that’s always the case. My life doesn’t add up to anything.
 - I don’t want to fall. All I want to do is stand on solid ground.
 - In small letters, someone has written NEVER FORGET on one of the slats. I know it’s supposed to be a pledge, but it feels like a curse. Don’t we have to forget some of it? Don’t we have to forget this feeling? If we don’t, how will we live?
 - This is the hard part about having best friends that I feel no attachment to – I don’t give them any benefit of the doubt. And being best friends is always about the benefit of the doubt.
 - There are few things harder than being born into the wrong body.
 - Sometimes when you hit send, you can imagine the message going straight into the person’s heart. But other times, like this time, it feels like the words are merely falling into a well.
 - If you want to live within the definition of your own truth, you have to choose to go through the initially painful and ultimately comforting process of finding it.
 - A year. A thousand kisses. And now a thousand one, a thousand two. There are so many other place we could have ended up, but I have to believe none of them would have felt this right. “All I want is you” is not entirely true. I want so much more, and with you I think I can get it.
 - The more kindness and justice are challenged, the more we must embrace them. Only when you are challenged – and only when you challenge yourself – do you discover what truly matters.
 - Knowledge is the only thing I take with me when I go.
 - It’s goodbye to some things. And hello to others.
 - There’s no way for them to take away my sadness, but they can make sure I am not empty of all the other feelings.
 - Our moments are music, and sometimes – just sometimes – we can catch them and put them into some lasting form. If we didn’t have music, I don’t think we could ever be truly happy, and if we didn’t have special moments, we would never find music.
 - Every person is a possibility. The hopeless romantics feel it most acutely, but even for others, the only way to keep going is to see every person as a possibility.
 - Your humor is your compass and your shield. You can hone it into a weapon or you can pull its strands out to make your very own cotton-candy blanket. You can’t exist on a diet of humor alone, but you can’t exist on a diet without it, either.
 - Sometimes the space between knowing what to do and actually doing it is a very short walk. Other times it is an impossible expanse.
 - There has to be a moment at the beginning when you wonder whether you’re in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself.
 - If this continues, if this goes on, then when I die, your memories of me will be my greatest accomplishment. You memories will be my most lasting impressions.
 - When distractions are manifold, it’s best to remember what you are supposed to be doing.
 - Every time you love someone, you put not just your faith in them, but your faith in everything to the test.
