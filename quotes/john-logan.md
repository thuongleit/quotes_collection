 - Music is the medicine of the mind.
 - Behold congenial Autumn comes, the Sabbath of the Year.
 - When I was your age, art was a lonely thing: no galleries, no collecting, no critics, no money. We didn’t have mentors. We didn’t have parents. We were alone. But it was a great time, because we had nothing to lose and a vision to gain.
