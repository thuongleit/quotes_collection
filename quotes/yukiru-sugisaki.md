 - My heart has been stolen by you.
 - I will steal your dreams tonight. Dark.
 - Even if I’m being selfish, but I want you to only look at me.
 - The person that I like is someone that I am uneasy about...
 - I want to create no matter what methods I have to use. And you want to steal no matter what methods you have to use. Given that which of us is the greater sinner?
 - A heart isn’t something you get. It’s something that’s born.
