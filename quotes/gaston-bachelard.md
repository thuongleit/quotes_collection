 - All the senses awaken and fall into harmony in poetic reverie. Poetic reverie listens to this polyphony of the senses, and the poetic consciousness must record it.

 - It is better to live in a state of impermanence than in one of finality.
 - Imagination is a tree. It has the integrative virtues of a tree. It is root and boughs. It lives between earth and sky. It lives in the earth and the wind. The imagined tree imperceptibly becomes a cosmological tree, the tree which epitomises a universe, which makes a universe.
 - What is the source of our first suffering? It lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak. It was born in the moment when we accumulated silent things within us.
 - The word chrysalis alone is an unmistakable indication that here two dreams are joined together, dreams that be-speak both the repose and flight of being, evening’s crystallization and wings that open to the light.

 - Love is never finished expressing itself, and it expresses itself better the more poetically it is dreamed.
 - Through imagination, thanks to the subtleties of the irreality function, we re-enter the world of confidence, the world of the confident being, which is the proper world for reverie.
 - One must always maintain one’s connection to the past and yet ceaselessly pull away from it. To remain in touch with the past requires a love of memory. To remain in touch with the past requires a constant imaginative effort.
 - In living off all the reflecting light furnished by poets, the I which dreams the reverie reveals itself not as poet but as poetizing I.
 - It is not a question of observation which propels mankind forward as if toward a looking glass of great magnitude; it is an instance of aggrandized reflection that insinuates the human psyche to the inhuman.
 - Ideas are invented only as correctives to the past. Through repeated rectification of this kind one may hope to disengage an idea that is valid.
 - A pretext-not a cause-is sufficient for us to enter the “solitary situation”, the situation of the dreaming solitude. In this solitude, memories arrange themselves in tableaux. Decor takes precedence over drama. Sad memories take on at least the peace of melancholy.

 - The poetic image is a sudden salience on the surface of the psyche.
 - To go upstairs in the word house is to withdraw step by step; while to go down to the cellar is to dream.
 - The psychology of the alchemist is that of reveries trying to constitute themselves in experiments on the exterior world. A double vocabulary must be established between reverie and experiment. The exaltation of the names of substances is the preamble to experiments on the “exalted” substances.
 - Thanks to his complex convictions, made strong with the forces of animus and anima, the alchemist believes he is seizing the soul of the world, participating in the soul of the world. Thus, from the world to the man, alchemy is a problem of souls.
 - In our view any awareness is an increment to consciousness, an added light, a reinforcement of psychic coherence. Its swiftness or instantaneity can hide this growth from us. But there is a growth of being in every instance of awareness. Consciousness is in itself an act, the human act.
 - The spoken reverie of substances calls matter to birth, to life, to spirituality.
 - By listening to certain words as a child listens to the sea in a seashell, a word dreamer hears the murmur of a world of dreams.

 - The characteristic of scientific progress is our knowing that we did not know.
 - All knowledge is in response to a question. If there were no question, there would be no scientific knowledge. Nothing proceeds from itself.

 - The subconscious is ceaselessly murmuring, and it is by listening to these murmurs that one hears its truth.
 - For in the end, the irreality function functions as well in the face of man as in the face of the cosmos. What would we know of others if we did not imagine things?
 - The cleverer I am at miniaturizing the world, the better I possess it.
 - Reverie is not a mind vacuum. It is rather the gift of an hour which knows the plenitude of the soul.
 - Cosmic reveries separate us from project reveries. They situate us in a world and not in a society. The cosmic reverie possesses a sort of stability or tranquility. It helps us escape time. It is a state.
 - To verify images kills them, and it is always more enriching to imagine than to experience.
 - For a knowledge of intimacy, localization in the spaces of our intimacy is more urgent than determination of dates.
 - Daydream transports the dreamer outside the immediate world to a world that bears the mark of infinity.

 - The best proof of the specificity of the book is that it is at once a reality of the virtual and a virtuality of the real.
 - A book is a human fact; a great book like Seraphita gathers together numerous psychological elements. These elements become coherent through a sort of psychological beauty. It does the reader a service.
 - An excess of childhood is the germ of a poem.
 - We are never real historians, but always near poets, and our emotion is perhaps nothing but an expression of a poetry that was lost.
 - The human mind has claimed for water one of its highest values-the value of purity.
 - I am alone so I dream of the being who has cured my solitude, who would be cured by solitudes. With its life, it brought me the idealizations of life, all the idealizations which give life a double, which lead life toward it summits, which make the dreamer too live by splitting...
 - When the image is new, the world is new.
 - Words, in their distant past, have the past of my reveries.
 - By following “the path of reverie”-a constantly downhill path-consciousness relaxes and wanders-and consequently becomes clouded. So it is never the right time, when one is dreaming, to “do phenomenology.”
 - Man is a creation of desire, not a creation of need.
 - We understand nature by resisting it.
 - What action could bodies and substances have if they were not named in a further increase of dignity where common nouns become proper nouns?
 - A word is a bud attempting to become a twig. How can one not dream while writing? It is the pen which dreams. The blank page gives the right to dream.
 - The words of the world want to make sentences.
 - A book is always an emergence above everyday life. A book is expressed life and thus is an addition to life.
 - Any work of science, no matter what its point of departure, cannot become fully convincing until it crosses the boundary between the theoretical and the experimental: Experimentation must give way to argument, and argument must have recourse to experimentation.
 - One must live to build one’s house, and not build one’s house to live in.
 - The reflected world is the conquest of calm.
 - How is it possible not to feel that there is communication between our solitude as a dreamer and the solitudes of childhood? And it is no accident that, in a tranquil reverie, we often follow the slope which returns us to our childhood solitudes.
 - In writing, you discover interior sonorities in words. Dipthongs sound differently beneath the pen. One hears them with their sounds divorced.
 - Nobody knows that in reading we are re-living our temptations to be a poet. All readers who have a certain passion for reading, nurture and repress, through reading, the desire to become a writer.

 - It is through the intentionality of poetic imagination that the poet’s soul discovers the opening of consciousness common to all true poetry.
 - True poetry is a function of awakening. It awakens us, but it must retain the memory of previous dreams.
 - He who ceases to learn cannot adequately teach.
 - Of course, any simplification runs the risk of mutilating reality; but it helps us establish perspectives.
 - Actually, however, life begins less by reaching upward, than by turning upon itself. But what a marvelously insidious, subtle image of life a coiling vital principle would be! And how many dreams the leftward oriented shell, or one that did not conform to the rotation of its species, would inspire!

 - The philosophy of poetry must acknowledge that the poetic act has no past, at least no recent past, in which its preparation and appearance could be followed.
 - The human being taken in his profound reality as well as in his great tension of becoming is a divided being, a being which divides again, having permitted himself the illusion of unity for barely an instant. He divides and then reunites.

 - At all times and in all fields the explanation by fire is a rich explanation.
 - Sleep refreshes only the body. It rarely sets the soul at rest.
 - In our life as a civilized person in the industrial age, we are invaded by objects; how could an object have a “force” when it no longer has individuality?
