 - We’re plugged in 24 hours a day now. We’re all part of one big machine, whether we are conscious of that or not. And if we can’t unplug from that machine, eventually we’re going to become mindless.
 - Suppose time is a circle, bending back on itself. The world repeats itself, precisely, endlessly.
 - I am spellbound by the plays of Shakespeare. And I am spellbound by the second law of thermodynamics. The great ideas in science, like the Cro-Magnon paintings and the plays of Shakespeare, are part of our cultural heritage.
 - The tragedy of this world is that no one is happy, whether stuck in a time of pain or joy.
 - If a person holds no ambitions in this world, he suffers unknowingly. If a person holds ambitions, he suffers knowingly, but very slowly.

 - We often do not see what we do not expect to see.
 - The tragedy of this world is that everyone is alone. For a life in the past cannot be shared with the present.
 - A person who cannot imagine the future is a person who cannot contemplate the results of his actions. Some are thus paralyzed into inaction.
 - The urge to discover, to invent, to know the unknown, seems so deeply human that we cannot imagine our history without it.
 - It is a world of impulse. It is a world of sincerity. It is a world in which every word spoken speaks just to that moment, every glance given has only one meaning, each touch has no past or no future, each kiss is a kiss of immediacy.
 - Time is the clarity for seeing right and wrong.
 - A life is a moment in season. A life is one snowfall. A life is one autumn day. A life is the delicate, rapid edge of a closing door’s shadow. A life is a brief movement of arms and of legs.
 - Who would fare better in this world of fitful time? Those who have seen the future and live only one life? Or those who have not seen the future and wait to live life? Or those who deny the future and live two lives?

 - Faith is the ability to honor stillness at some moments, and at others to ride the passion and exuberance.
 - As long as God does not intervene in the contemporary universe in such a way as to violate physical laws, science has no way of knowing whether God exists or not. The belief or disbelief in such a Being is therefore a matter of faith.
 - In a world without future, each moment is the end of the world.
 - The history of science can be viewed as the recasting of phenomena that were once thought to be accidents as phenomena that can be understood in terms of fundamental causes and principles.
 - Novels aren’t pedagogical instruments, or instructions in law or physics or any other discipline. A novel has to be an emotional experience, a trip of the imagination, and because science has raised so many issues that concern and affect humans, it’s a good starting place for me.
 - No one knows the nature of God, or even if God exists. In a sense, all of our religions are literary works of the imagination.
 - Order is the law of nature, the universal trend, the cosmic direction. If time is an arrow, that arrow points toward order. The future is pattern, organization, union, intensification; the past, randomness, confusion, disintegration, dissipation.
 - I wouldn’t overall say that The Diagnosis it’s a funny book. I would say that it has comic moments. It’s a modern tragedy.

 - Is it possible for a person to love without wanting love back? Is anything so pure? Or is love, by its nature, a reciprocity, like oceans and clouds, an evaporating of seawater and a replenishing by rain?

 - What sense is there in continuing when one has seen the future?
 - I think it is always a long shot getting a book made into a film. Making that book into a film is going to be quite a challenge.
 - A world in which time is absolute is a world of consolation. For while the movements of people are unpredictable, the movement of time is predictable. While people can be doubted, time cannot be doubted. While people brood, time skips ahead without looking back.
 - In a world in which time is a circle, every handshake, every kiss, every birth, every word, will be repeated precisely.
 - In a world without future, each parting of friends is a death. In a world without future, each loneliness is final. In a world without future, each laugh is the last laugh. In a world without future, beyond the present lies nothingness, and people cling to the present as if hanging from a cliff.
 - I re-read a lot of books that I like a lot. There are some books that I try to reread every couple of years. A good book changes for you every few years because you are in a different place in your own life.
 - All writers have roots they draw from – travel, work, family. My roots are in science and it is fertile ground for fiction.
 - It’s not necessarily a large number of people that affect the culture. You don’t count the number of influential voices, you weigh them. A hundred people can affect the culture.
 - I still will sit down at the piano and play when I am wrestling with something emotionally or just want to move into the musical world.
 - Some say it is best not to go near the center of time. Life is a vessel of sadness, but is noble to live life and without time there is no life. Others disagree. They would rather have an eternity of contentment, even if that eternity were fixed and frozen, like a butterfly mounted in a case.
 - Unfortunately, public debates do not have much room for subtlety. The audience wants a quick thrust at your opponent, not a slow and convoluted series of moves. Whenever Obama uses subtleties in discussing a complex issue, he gets creamed.

 - As both a scientist and a humanist myself, I have struggled to understand different claims to knowledge, and I have eventually come to a formulation of the kind of religious belief that would, in my view, be compatible with science.
 - Franz Kafka is an idea person. His books begin and end in ideas. Ideas have always been important to me in my writing. To the point that I have to be careful that they don’t take over.
 - My writings are an exploration, and I think a lot of writers would tell you this, but in writing, you’re not simply putting down things that are already known to you. You’re actually discovering in the writing process, you’re actually creating knowledge.
 - Continents of memory had been lost.

 - The target of power is more interesting than its quantity.
 - The time-deaf are unable to speak what they know. For speech needs a sequence of words, spoken in time.
