 - Don’t hope for a life without problems. An easy life results in a judgmental and lazy mind.
 - Attain deliverance in disturbances.
 - Throw false spirituality away like a pair of old shoes.
 - So an ancient once said, “Accept the anxieties and difficulties of this life”. Don’t expect your practice to be clear of obstacles. Without hindrances the mind that seeks enlightenment may be burnt out. So an ancient once said, “Attain deliverance in disturbances”.
