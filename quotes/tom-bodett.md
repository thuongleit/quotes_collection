 - The difference between an optimist and a pessimist? An optimist laughs to forget, but a pessimist forgets to laugh.

 - I’m real. I believe what I’m saying. If Motel 6 wasn’t the type of operation they say it is – and I stay at them when I travel – I wouldn’t do their commercials. That comes through on the radio, and that’s what it’s all about.
