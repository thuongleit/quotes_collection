 - Life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents.
 - A man has cause for regret only when he sows and no one reaps.
 - Life should not be estimated exclusively by the standard of dollars and cents. I am not disposed to complain that I have planted and other have gathered the fruits. A man has cause for regret only when he sows and no one reaps.
 - I am not disposed to complain that I have planted and others have gathered the fruits.
