 - Few activities are as delightful as learning new vocabulary.
 - It’s so important to reach out to people you trust, and who can give you honest feedback, and keep those people close to you. You don’t want to surround yourself with enablers.
 - You have no control over other people’s taste, so focus on staying true to your own.
 - I’m constantly reminding myself that the world owes us nothing. We have to make our way and we have to work hard, persevere and make our own way in the world because the world isn’t waiting for us, so let’s let the world know we are here.

 - We need to treat each other with consideration. In my world, the squeaky wheel does not get the grease.
 - My advice to the 10 year old daughter is: fashion happens in a context. It’s societal, it’s cultural, it’s historic, it’s economic, and it’s political. So all of her studies, everything that is happening in the world, all needs to be channeled through her in order to be a good designer.
 - It’s man’s impact on our world that appeals to me more than just nature running wild.
 - Whoever’s designing for plus-size doesn’t get it. The entire garment needs to be reconceived. You can’t just take a size 8 and make it larger.
 - I believe in the semiotics of clothes. They send a message about how the world perceives us. For me it goes beyond clothes, it’s grooming. It’s accessories. It’s the whole head to toe look.

 - I really cherish having my private time and being alone and being able to decompress. It’s my own version of meditating.

 - I believe that treating other people well is a lost art.
 - I have one brand I go to, and it’s Suit Supply, and it’s fantastic. I was spending $3,500-$4000 on a suit, and the suit I’m wearing today was $500. And they last you forever. The shoulders are set in by hand, it’s phenomenal.
 - The clothes we wear send a message about how the world perceives us.
 - I learned from teaching. If you are perceived by the student to be belittling them or purely criticizing them without offering up words of encouragement and support, they shut down and discredit you.
 - At all costs, avoid clothes that are too big. The more volume your clothes have, the more volume you appear to have.
 - I hate crocs. May they please go away.
 - I will say that the high road can get so high that you can get a nose bleed, in which case you have to get off the high road.
 - I learned quickly that if the student’s perception is that you’re not listening to them, and not understanding them, they discredit you.
 - Life is a big collaboration – and when you’re tackling something that is painful and troubling and is causing you such desperate grief that you think life’s not worth living – you need to reach out. To people who will reach back.

 - You can be too rich and too thin, but you can never be too well read or too curious about the world.

 - Most people wear clothing that is too big or too small for them. And “oversized” is the downfall for most of us. We have to be careful that we don’t look like we’re slipcovered!
 - And I’m the first one to tell people to break the rules. But you can only break the rules once you know what the rules are. The other thing is, fashion is the last design discipline to actually have academic texts and historical analysis.
 - I haven’t had a date in 26 years.
 - When it comes to my vocabulary, I felt a responsibility when I was teaching to raise the bar of conversation in my classroom. And with my own students, I refused to let them use the phrase “I like” or “I don’t like” when we were engaged in a critique.
 - I have my mantra about silhouette, proportion, and fit. I believe that when they are in harmony and balance, you’ll look great in anything.
 - Everyone has a best feature, so find clothes and accessories to accentuate those, whether it’s your shoulders or your long legs!
 - I found early on in teaching, if you’re too blunt an instrument, the students discredit you and think you’re just being mean. They’re not interested in what you have to say.
 - I would never dream of telling people how to dress. but I do say to them, however you are dressing, accept responsibility for it. And also, unless asked, I don’t judge. And if asked to judge – I would approach it socratically, I would approach it with questions.
 - I wouldn’t know what to do on a date. I don’t have the time. To make a relationship work, I’d have to give something up, and I’m not so sure I’m willing to do that.
 - So perhaps the real secret to style is filling yourself to the absolute brim with engagement. Loving not wisely, but too well and all that.
 - Whether it’s fashion or it’s home, it’s all about style. The clothes we wear send a message about how we are perceived, and our home does the same thing.
 - I love shopping on a budget. I believe that more fashion mistakes are made by people with deep pockets than by those who shop on a budget.
 - When it comes to dressing, comfort is overrated. A little discomfort probably means your clothes fit and they’re not pajamas.

 - Nothing makes me happier than working with real people in the real world.
 - Does a man need to know what a peplum is? Probably not.

 - If you had pockets, you were associated with a labor force. It meant you had things to carry yourself. Otherwise, your lady’s maid or your manservant would have done it for you.

 - I would say this to my students all the time, it’s about 30% you as the teacher and 70% about them. They tend to think that their role is to be the baby bird in a nest and you’re going to feed them? They’re going to feed themselves, or they’re going to starve.
