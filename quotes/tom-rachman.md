 - Our worst fear isn’t the end of life but the end of memories.
 - The training of a journalist, of working with words for thousands of hours, is extraordinarily useful for a fiction writer.
 - Anything that’s worth anything is complicated.
 - Remembering is the most overrated thing. Forgetting is far superior.
