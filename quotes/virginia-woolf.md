 - It is far harder to kill a phantom than a reality.
 - I am reading six books at once, the only way of reading; since, as you will agree, one book is only a single unaccompanied note, and to get the full sound, one needs ten others at the same time.

 - In any case life is but a procession of shadows, and God knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly, and see them depart with such anguish, being shadows.

 - Oh, is this your buried treasure? The light in the heart.
 - It was a silly, silly dream, being unhappy.
 - We live in constant danger of coming apart. The mystery of why we do not always come apart is the animating tension of all art.
 - Every face, every shop, bedroom window, public-house, and dark square is a picture feverishly turned – in search of what? It is the same with books. What do we seek through millions of pages?
 - For there is a virtue in truth; it has an almost mystic power. Like radium, it seems to give off forever and ever grains of energy, atoms of light.
