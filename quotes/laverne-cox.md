 - There are lessons in everything. The bad, the good. Our job is to listen, and to continue to learn, so that maybe we get better at this. Maybe get better at life.
 - We are not what other people say we are. We are who we know ourselves to be, and we are what we love. Thatâ€™s okay.
 - If you have a problem with people living their lives and being authentically who they are, you really should go and do some soul-searching.
 - By doing the work to love ourselves more, I believe we will love each other better.
 - Each and every one of us has the capacity to be an oppressor. I want to encourage each and everyone of us to interrogate how we might be an oppressor and how we might be able to become liberators for ourselves and for each other.
 - Who you are authentically is alright.
