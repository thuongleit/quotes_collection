 - The most painful and jealously guarded secrets are perhaps the ones that everyone around us knows. Stupid tragedies. Useless tears.
 - When I left, I had learnt nothing. I took nothing with me. At least, thatâ€™s what I thought then.
 - I was realizing, for the first time, that everything goes on, turns gray, is ruined in the living. That there is no end to our story until death comes and the body decays...
 - That profound night freedom was agreeable and exciting.
 - It was the first time I traveled alone, but I was not scared.
 - I write short, my words tight to the thread of the narrative.
