 - You know, my mother’s beautiful, my dad was a really handsome man, and there was a lot of talk about looks when I was growing up.
 - One trick I swear by: I pour a little neroli or lavender oil onto a hot towel and use it to wipe off my makeup. It opens up my pores, and then my face cream sinks in better.

 - I don’t want to feel I’m responsible for anorexia across the country.
 - I guess Pumas are in their 30s. Cougars in their 40s Jaguars are 50s, and Sabretooths go into the 60s, right?
 - I’m not comfortable leaving my house. If someone invites me over, I would go but it’s not like I’m one to say, ‘Hey, let’s hang out at your house tonight.’

 - I think I look very healthy. You’ve already seen what I’ve eaten, so I couldn’t be anorexic, and I wouldn’t throw up if you paid me $1,000, so I’m not bulimic. Okay, for $1,000 I would stick my finger down my throat, but throwing up is the worst thing in the world.

 - A lot of my humor does come from anger. It’s like, you’re not gonna pull one over on me – which is pretty much my motto anyways.
 - It seems like everything is so polarized. You get the caricatures of people, the caricatures of their beliefs. “I hate this kind of person” or “I love this kind of person.” But actually, there’s a lot of great things about them. There are things to like. There’s possibility of change.
