 - The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence.
 - Logic is the hygiene the mathematician practices to keep his ideas healthy and strong.
 - Besides language and music, mathematics is one of the primary manifestations of the free creative power of the human mind.
 - A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine, or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden and almost invisible under a mass of technical details.
 - Symmetry, as wide or as narrow as you may define its meaning, is one idea by which man through the ages has tried to comprehend and create order, beauty and perfection.
 - Mathematics is not the rigid and rigidity-producing schema that the layman thinks it is; rather, in it we find ourselves at that meeting point of constraint and freedom that is the very essence of human nature.
 - You can not apply mathematics as long as words still becloud reality.
 - God exists because arithmetic is consistent – the Devil exists because we can’t prove it!
 - In geometric and physical applications, it always turns out that a quantity is characterized not only by its tensor order, but also by symmetry.
 - We must learn a new modesty. We have stormed the heavens, but succeeded only in building fog upon fog, a mist which will not support anybody who earnestly desires to stand upon it. What is valid seems so insignificant that it may be seriously doubted whether anlaysis is at all possible.
 - Before you generalize, formalize, and axiomatize there must be mathematical substance.
 - For mathematics, even to the logical forms in which it moves, is entirely dependent on the concept of natural number.
 - Mathematics has the inhuman quality of starlight, brilliant and sharp, but cold.
 - Mathematics has been called the science of the infinite. Indeed, the mathematician invents finite constructions by which questions are decided that by their very nature refer to the infinite. This is his glory.
 - Our mathematics of the last few decades has wallowed in generalities and formalizations.
 - But it seems an irony of creation that man’s mind knows how to handle things the better the farther removed they are from the center of his existence. Thus we are cleverest where knowledge matters least...
