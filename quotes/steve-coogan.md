 - If things don’t come easy to you, you have to pull a rabbit out of a hat.
 - The truth is somewhere in the middle of funny and serious.
 - Me, myself, personally, I like to keep myself private. I have never said I am a paragon of virtue, a model of morality. I simply do what I do.
 - I’m 47, my girlfriend’s 33; she’s 14 years younger than me, back of the net!
 - Guide dogs for the blind. It’s cruel really, isn’t it? Getting a dog to lead a man round all day. Not fair on either of them.
 - I always think that, even when people behave badly, if you like something deep inside them, then there is a tiny bit of nobility – they wish they could be good.
 - I love Sherlock Holmes. I’ve got all his books, leather-bound. What I thought was great about Sherlock Holmes was that not only was he a supersleuth, he was also a hard worker. Not only did he go out and solve the crimes, he came home and wrote it all down. Fantastic. That’s why I admire him.
 - Even if I screw up in my personal life, as long as I’m not destroying myself, I just think, “Okay, I screwed up.” I’m not Mother Theresa.
 - In my mind God made Adam and Eve, he didn’t make Adam and Steve.
 - If you chase something too desperately, it eludes you.
 - Actually the best thing I did was to get thrown out by my wife. She’s living with a fitness instructor. He drinks that yellow stuff in tins. He’s an idiot.
 - I’m just a good Catholic boy – I do naughty things and feel guilty about them.
 - I’m not Mother Teresa. But I’m not Frank Bough, either. I am getting older and a bit more sensible. I’m not going to be popping up in dungeons every six months. If you catch me preaching fidelity while I am shagging chickens then throw the book at me. Otherwise, leave me alone.
 - That’s what gives people hope – that you can still love someone from afar and you can still have those feelings across an ocean.
 - I don’t apologize for my behavior anymore. Whatever I do or don’t do shouldn’t matter. Moral certainty is dangerous. Moral certainty is what makes people go to war unnecessarily and illegally. Morality, as any halfway intelligent human being would tell you, is a very subjective thing.
 - I don’t like new bands. I don’t want to be one of those pathetic old men in their forties who knows exactly what 18-year-olds are into.
 - The trick is always to write in pairs because if at least two people find it funny, you’ve immediately halved the odds of it not being funny.
 - When I see friends from school I think they’ve all grown old and I’ve stayed the same.
 - A woman wearing a revealing dress will always be sexier than a naked woman.
 - I like the British public. There is something in this country called tall poppy syndrome. You’re good but you’re not that good, pal, OK? The natural state of our nation is slightly miserable, and probably the healthier for it. In America you don’t get a key down the side of your Bentley...
 - All those people who go around saying Life begins at forty, they’re notable by their absence. The nerve.
 - People regurgitate the same old cliches and it becomes like a photocopy of a photocopy of something that’s vaguely interesting.
 - Hacking into a victim of crime’s phone is a sort of poetically elegant manifestation of a modus operandi the tabloids have.
 - When you see a crowd of people jumping up and down at a pop concert, all gloriously in the moment, I don’t think you’ll ever see a comedian there. They’ll all be standing at the sides, looking at how it all fits together.
 - The important thing is not to be defined by what others think of you.
 - No one has a monopoly on wisdom, and even for people who aren’t religious, you can learn things from religious people.
 - I am of the very last generation who didn’t have computers at school. As we grow old we’ll become something of an aberration.
 - I think it’s always funny when you see kids do Shakespeare. When I was at school, I was in Hamlet. I played Claudius, who’s supposed to be a 60-year-old man, and I was like 18. It’s inherently ridiculous seeing 18-year-old boys with gray beards. That’s always funny.
 - I’m not elitist. I like to do crowd-pleasing stuff which is a bit smart, but is just about belly laughs.
 - I don’t like big feet. It reminds me of gammon.
 - Sadly, I can’t say the same for my Father, who is probably in a different place – Hell.
 - The Bible, undoubtedly, is a mixed bag. I don’t see myself coming back to the Church. I do like the tradition. If you come from a strong culture, you can decide what you agree with and what you don’t agree with. If you’re given a blank canvas, it’s almost harder in life.
 - I knew lots of Irish ladies in my life who would say daft things and then would just say something incredibly truthful in a very simple way with simple language – a few well chosen words that would take an intellectual five minutes to express. I like that.
 - Big comedy is good, I like things that are big, but good comedy has to be truthful I think and has to reflect some sort of reality.
 - I’m a single guy now and can do what I like. As my agent said, so long as it’s not a live man or a dead woman, I’ll be fine. And that, hand on heart, is unlikely to happen.
 - I’ve always been drawn to discomfort and that limbo of unease you get between comedy and tragedy.
 - Convoy? Michael, you’re hanging around with a man who uses a collective term for a single vehicle.
 - Got my fungal foot powder? Ah, it’s a lifesaver, you know. I’d effectively be disabled if it weren’t for these.
 - Knowing about comedy has helped me with the drama. To see people laugh, it’s like there are moments of catharsis in the middle of sadness.
 - I’ve met people who’ve dismissed me, and then they find out that they like my work, and suddenly their attitude changes toward me. And I think that’s very funny and very human. But it’s also very unattractive.
 - That was liquid football.
 - It may seem like improv because it flows quite naturally, and a little bit of leeway for improvisation is good, but you have to be judicious with it. So it’s good, but sometimes people deify it. You can’t improvise your way out of a paper hat.
 - The Church at its best is about empowering the disempowered and giving voice to the dispossessed and not putting a price on everything and not being about the bottom line and not worshipping the market or everything that is material.
 - I like the transience of Klimt paintings.
 - If you got the balls to follow something through, you can end up being the coolest, smartest guy in the room, because you’ve literally put your ass on the line.
 - I woke with a start. At first I assumed I’d trumped myself awake again.
 - There are conservative values where certain lifestyles are imposed and everybody should have 2.4 children and a dog and a cat and a house and you should feel like God and you should believe in God and you should be a capitalist. I don’t buy any of that.
 - There is a strong ethical dimension to the best comedy. Not only does it avoid reinforcing prejudices, it actively challenges them.
 - If you are a great dramatic actor then you often don’t know if people are enjoying your stuff at all because they are sitting there in silence. But with comedy it’s a simple premise. If it’s funny, people laugh. If it’s not, they don’t.
 - The best feeling in the world is performing in front of a live audience who like what you’re doing. I can understand why people become dictators just because of the thrill they get making the speeches.
 - I wasn’t a naturally confident, extravert, outgoing person.
 - I like comedy, but I like comedy as a device in drama. It’s more interesting for me to use comedy to seduce people into thinking about something serious. If you want to hit a beat in a drama, you can distract people with a little comedy, and you can punch them in the gut with some emotion.
 - If the person who can effectively sanction ill-conceived wars can play the electric guitar, which is a symbol of rebellion, then that whole worldview becomes confused.
 - A friend of mine once said he like his women like his parmesan: strong smelling and shaved. I don’t agree with that, but I don’t like hairy women.
 - The great thing is that the funny side of getting old is fuel for my comedy.
 - The tabloids operate in an amoral parallel universe where the bottom line is selling newspapers.
 - I always find it easier to portray myself as being unlikeable and idiotic; to actually play a character that is likeable and engages the audience is far more difficult. It’s a more subtle kind of challenge.
 - Going to a grammar school, you mixed with all sorts of different types and I used to listen to how they talked. When I did my imitations, I could sound like someone really rough, or I could sound like a cabinet minister.
 - If you start to disrespect the character you’re playing, or play it too much for laughs, that can work for a sketch, it will sell some gags, but it’s all technique. It’s like watching a juggler – you can be impressed by it, but it’s not going to touch you in any way.
 - Most of all I don’t want to be bored. That’s why I’d rather do something that has some sort of ambition, that risks failing, rather than make safer, more comfortable choices.
 - Two thousand years ago, the Holy family had a ramble from Nazareth to Bethlehem – in much the same way as I’m having a ramble from Norwich to Swaffham. Although I’m not comparing myself to Jesus – I don’t want to get bogged down in that whole controversy again.
 - Yeah, all drama teachers are very effusive, very demonstrative, very emotionally open, very big, and gesticulate a lot, and are very physical.
 - When it comes to morality, I’d rather have an unfaithful president like Bill Clinton, who tried to reform welfare, than a faithful George Bush who propagated an illegal war on the rest of the world. So that is where my morality stands.
 - I don’t go to premieres, unless I’m contractually bound to.
 - If you do something very successful, you will then be defined by it.
 - To me, I like and understand ritual and I think it is important. Things that we do that give us comfort are important. Like Christmas, I like to go into a church and hear the carols sung. There’s a comfort of actually going inside of a church, I find them serene. They’re unchanging.
 - The fundamentalists are insistent that they know best. It’s a dictatorial attitude towards personal morality, which is a modern creation that came about in the 19th century.
 - London audiences are tricky, too. They don’t laugh as much as the Northern audiences because, and I hate to say this, they are a bit cleverer normally, and they are picking up on all the little details and listening more carefully.
 - I happen to have a public profile. Ditto newspaper editors. It’s a result of what I do, not an end.
 - When I was a student I was very, very ambitious, completely immersed in my comedy career. I never had that period of reckless hedonism that you should get out of your system in your youth.
 - There’s never any graffiti in the hotel. Although in the Gents a couple of weeks ago I did see someone had drawn a lady’s part. Quite detailed. The guy obviously had talent.
 - I think if you try to look for something to show off as an actor, vanity can get the better of you.

 - Look at the 18th century. There was a lot more freedom going on.
 - I want my work to be judged, not me.
 - I did not become successful in my work through embracing or engaging in celebrity culture. I never signed away my privacy in exchange for success.
 - What I don’t like is dance music or hip hop or any of that sort of thing.
 - I’m really encouraged by Pope Francis, because I think his attitude is totally laudable.
 - I’m getting older, so I’m quieting down a bit.
 - I’m just attracted to playing people who are ostensible unlikable. That’s not to say that there’s something in there that makes you care. It might be that you just find them so awful that you just can’t stop watching, like a car crash.
 - I find impressionists slightly annoying, really.
 - Even great people are always slightly disappointing, which is generally what makes them interesting.
 - When I play myself, I want to be a slightly better person. It just agrees. Everything I play about myself is kind of true, but it’s amplified. We all edit, don’t we? If you’re self-aware, you stop yourself – you know how to behave properly.
 - As soon as I see period costume, I turn off. It’s like hearing drama on Radio 4.
 - I don’t think I’m kind of universally known. I think in the indie world I’m probably better known than in some mainstream Hollywood terms.
 - I’m not turned away from the church through anger, although I have criticisms of it. It’s through finding affirmation of life and illumination of life through creativity and art.
 - Look at all those American preachers who got caught with their pants down. They say one thing and they are doing another. I try to be more honest about it, both in my thinking and my behavior.
 - I don’t like comedy that I think is bad comedy, where people are trying to be sick for the sake of it, where there’s no intellectual point behind it. I like stuff that’s got an underlying point of view.
 - I used to do stuff at college. I could do voices. I could make some people laugh. I wasn’t the class clown, but I knew I had this skill.
 - I use improvisation as a writing tool to help produce material that goes into a script, but a well-crafted script shouldn’t sound scripted, and oftentimes people confuse something that looks like improvisation for what is actually a very well-written script that is well-acted.
 - The irony is, of course, that many of the values that I was raised with, that I think are very important, that I hold dear, are the result of a religious faith.
 - I have never wanted to be famous, as such – fame is a by-product.
 - Actors say they do their own stunts for the integrity of the film but I did them because they looked like a lot of fun.
 - The rest of Europe tends to be very comfortable with sexuality. The British and the Americans are kind of hung up about it.

 - Comedy is unique in the sense that laughter is a palpable noise that everyone makes.
 - I am lucky to be in a profession that is not age dependent.

 - I don’t think there’s anything outside what comedy can address.
 - I try to not make safe choices, but I also like to do stuff which is interesting and is sort of exciting in some way and accessible.
 - Actually, bizarrely, in America, I get more appreciation from the odd, unusual stuff I’ve done, almost because I’m not, if you like, famous in America as I am in England.
 - I don’t want to go around making everyone else agree with me. I don’t feel the need to do that.
 - I like the fact that people come together who have shared values, but I don’t believe that a man died 2,000 years ago and was crucified on a cross to save me from my original sin.

 - Depending on which side of the fence you’re on, you could argue that the sexual liberation of the late ’60s, led to women being emancipated in some ways. That they found a voice during that time, with feminism. It’s complicated.

 - I think it’s always funny when you see kids do Shakespeare.
 - I’m a huge fan of Jack Lemmon, he was someone who managed to tread that line between comedy and tragedy and sometimes give very big performances, but they were never over-demonstrative and they were never not based on a kind of real truthful human being.
 - I think there’s as much profundity and wisdom in Shakespeare, more so in fact, than those in the Bible.
 - I like to do movies that provoke rather than reinforce conservative values.
 - The one thing that gives you faith is the fact that people can be apart physically but they can still have an emotional connection.
