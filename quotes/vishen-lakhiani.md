 - It’s about using the right tools, with the right triggers, within a proper marketing framework.
 - Epic things start with small humble steps. Pay respect to your beginnings. And if you’re just starting out, know that it’s OK to be sucky. To be small. To be messy and chaotic. Just make sure to never ever stop dreaming.
