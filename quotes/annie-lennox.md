 - I love to make music and stay grounded.
 - Life expectancy in many parts of Africa can be something around the age of thirty five to thirty eight. I mean you’re very fortunate if you live to that age. In fact when I went to Uganda for the first time one of the things that occurred to me was that I saw very few elderly people.
 - There must be an angel playing with my heart.
 - Please don’t ask me for the actual answer to anything, because I don’t have it. Because all I do is look at stuff and ask questions. What can I say? I just think the world’s barking mad. Look, I’m not an expert. I’m just an ordinary person.
 - I have a calling in my soul, if you like, to try to make my life in some way worthwhile. What is the value of my existence?
 - The world is a heartbreaking place, without any question.
 - The future hasn’t happened yet and the past is gone. So I think the only moment we have is right here and now, and I try to make the best of those moments, the moments that I’m in.

 - Charity is a fine thing if it’s meeting a gap where needs must be met and there are no other resources. But in the long term we need to support people into helping themselves.

 - I have a lot to be grateful for.
 - Feminism is a word that I identify with. The term has become synonymous with vitriolic man-hating but it needs to come back to a place where both men and women can embrace it. It is particularly important for women in developing countries.

 - I will go out of my way to avoid the shopping crowds and the extreme consumerism – I hate all that.

 - Desire, despair, desire. So many monsters.
 - Fear paralyses you – fear of flying, fear of the future, fear of leaving a rubbish marriage, fear of public speaking, or whatever it is.
 - I sang a lot as a little girl and entered competitions. I loved singing in choirs, but it was as I got older that I really found my voice.
 - Twerking is not feminism. Thats what I’m referring to. It’s not – it’s not liberating, it’s not empowering. It’s a sexual thing that you’re doing on a stage; it doesn’t empower you. That’s my feeling about it.
 - There are two kinds of artists left: those who endorse Pepsi and those who simply won’t.

 - You become really ugly when you become very superficial and self-obsessed.
 - Fame for fame’s sake is toxic – some people want that, with no boundaries. It’s unhealthy.

 - I was brought up in a tenement house in a working district. We didn’t even have a bathroom! We had a gaslight in the hallway and a black-and-white TV.

 - I have always been a very visual person and a keen observer.
 - I haven’t lived my life through my daughters. Some parents devote everything to their children, which must be so hard, and it’s very beautiful. But I’m a working parent, so I’ve always kept my own life.
 - It’s hard to tell how far women’s individuality has come in the past twenty years.

 - I am fascinated by history and particularly the Victorian era.
 - There was a time when I looked to other people for recognition, because I didn’t have enough confidence to trust my own judgment. Now I’m not looking for reassurance, because I realize how fickle people are. My own strength is the best I can have.
 - When you’re that successful, things have a momentum, and at a certain point you can’t really tell whether you have created the momentum or it’s creating you.
 - If you want to open a supermarket chain and put your face all around the globe, selling your baby and your dog, if it makes you happy, who am I to disagree, as the song goes. But it’s not for me. I’ve always tried to keep my integrity and keep my autonomy.
 - We all fight over what the label ‘feminism’ means but for me it’s about empowerment. It’s not about being more powerful than men – it’s about having equal rights with protection, support, justice. It’s about very basic things. It’s not a badge like a fashion item.
 - Although I have lived in London, I have never really considered London my home because it was always going to be a stopping-off point for me, and it has been too.
 - I stand on the shoulders of giants that have gone before me, in terms of affording people like myself, women, the access to democracy, the vote, medical treatment, education, everything that I’ve been given. It’s all been earned.

 - When you go to Africa, and you see children, they’re usually barefoot, dirty and in rags, and they’d love to go to school.
 - I don’t have clear-cut positions. I get baffled by things. I have viewpoints. Sometimes they change.
 - Fashion is temporary; fashion is a race. What it’s doing is giving you something that you say, “This is the outer wrapping of me.” Style is something else. It’s not quantifiable. Fashion is about selling. Fashion is about what’s in. Style is independent of that; style is individual.
 - It’s not fair to compare one artist to another because they all come with their own sort of elements to the picnic, you know.
 - If you come face to face with some really challenging situations and tragic circumstances – you are going in there with a purpose. You are not going in there as a tourist.

 - The contrast of the world that we live in and the world that is here in Aspen and the world inhabited by women who have no resources, little or no, very few resources – huge disparity.
 - I’m not a Christian, but I think the Christian message is a good one.
 - In a sense, the music business and I haven’t always been the best of bedfellows. Artists often have to fight their corner. Your music goes through these filters of record labels and media, and you’re hoping you’ll find someone who’ll help you get your work into the world.
 - If people like your music, you can’t guarantee they’re going to love you.

 - You’re never quite sure where the song is going, because you might not find the word to rhyme with the end of the line. You have to find associative meaning to get you there. So it’s rather like doing a crossword puzzle backwards. A kind of strange, three-dimensional, abstract crossword puzzle.
