 - The body benefits from movement, and the mind benefits from stillness.
 - There are no boundaries-only possibilities.
 - If you want to be miserable, think of yourself. If you want to be happy, think of others.
 - Like gravity, karma is so basic we often don’t even notice it.
 - We suffer because we want life to be different from what it is. We suffer because we try to make pleasurable what is painful, to make solid what is fluid, to make permanent what is always changing.
 - Enlightened Society is all about nurturing the human spirit – waking up to the goodness, kindness and strength that we already have.
 - If you rise with a positive attitude – because everything is possible, everything is doable – if you have that level of confidence, you exude it. It actually inspires the people around you.
 - If the mind is flexible, the world is flexible.
 - Karma moves in two directions. If we act virtuously, the seed we plant will result in happiness. If we act non-virtuously, suffering results.
 - Our mind is always subject to being distracted by thoughts of what happened in the past and ideas of what could happen in the future, but the living experience is what is happening NOW.
 - Every moment of our life is important.
 - Movement is good for the body. Stillness is good for the mind.
 - The bones and tendons of the mind are mindfulness and awareness. Mindfulness is the mind’s strength, and awareness is its flexibility. Without these abilities, we cannot function. When we drink a glass of water, drive a car, or have a conversation, we are using mindfulness and awareness.
 - Our power comes not from suppressing others but from uplifting them.
 - Running and meditation are very personal activities. Therefore they are lonely. This loneliness is one of their best qualities because it strengthens our incentive to motivate ourselves.

 - Whatever we do lays a seed in our deepest consciousness, and one day that seed will grow.
 - Auspicious coincidence is the right thing happening at the right time.
 - What distinguishes Shambhala is its intention of trying to create a society based upon certain principles. So, Shambhala’s focus is not just on the individual, but on society as a whole.
 - When we are using this term ‘basic goodness,’ we are talking about our inherent completeness.
 - Initially, you have to live a period where you are developing your attitude. I would consider that a meditation: determining what you want to do. You have a period where you meditate and you get the strength.
 - As a leader, people push you. They really want to keep pushing you until you get aggressive. Then they say, “Oh, see, it doesn’t work.”
 - If we are going to live in a society, there has to be an attitude where people really do care for others.
 - Shambhala existed in Tibet and has been continued over the years, and now it is in the West. At its core, it is very much dedicated to the basic theme of benefiting others.
 - When the mind is totally present, it is relaxed, nimble, and sensitive. It feels lighter and clearer. It notices everything, but it is not distracted by anything. It is the feeling of knowing exactly where you are and what you are doing.
 - We want to infuse our day with good habits so that we can turn seemingly mundane situations into a ceremony of goodness.
 - Shambhala is a tradition where there were rulers, kings, and powerful people who actually were very benevolent and kind. They got things done, and they didn’t abandon their tradition.
 - Many of us are slaves to our minds. Our own mind is our worst enemy. We try to focus, and our mind wanders off. We try to keep stress at bay, but anxiety keeps us awake at night. We try to be good to the people we love, but then we forget them and put ourselves first.
 - The notion of auspiciousness is something positive, something with forward momentum, coming out of our actions.
 - It doesn’t matter if you’re rich or poor-the determining factor of success and happiness is contentment.

 - The most outrageous thing we can do in this world is to accept what happens and fly with it.
 - True happiness is always available to us, but first we have to create the environment for it to flourish.
 - In a speedy and aggressive culture, we need different principles to live by-bravery and insight. The first moment of bravery is building trust in the mind, which we do in meditation. When we know how to create peace in our own mind, we can transform the world.

 - My books definitely are ambassadors, as you called them. They express what the vision is, what the purpose is.
 - As the conceptual, material world increases its hold on us, and inanimate objects become more lifelike, we humans must become more human. Open hearts, kindness and care-these are our most precious gifts.
 - I think we are very environmental people. We need to be supported environmentally. Books very much have that imprint on the mind.
 - We live in a culture where information is becoming easier to access. Certain special practices have been kept very quiet and secret, and those traditions need to be respected. But there are a lot of teachings people can access that would benefit them greatly.

 - To protect this earth is to protect the very spirit of life.
 - The nature of our mind may be displayed in many ways, but Ashe is the fundamental basis.
 - The first thing you have to do is acknowledge the basic and fundamental goodness of all beings. If you don’t, then you are going to have conflict. That’s at the core of Shambhala.
 - Your regular teachers will get mad at you. If you keep asking something again and again, they will get tired of saying the same thing. A book will not do that. A book always will be there for you. In whatever you want, the book will be there.

 - I think Shambhala can be a very strong force as a social example of how you can try to live a life balanced in terms of both the spiritual and the secular.
 - Shambhala does have unique teachings, as do many Buddhist traditions. For example, certain teachings within Shambhala have to do with raising the personal windhorse, or the energy of the individual, so a person has good fortitude to be able to live a good life.
 - It is said that if our intention is to help others-even if we are unable to follow it through-we will never have any regret. Regret is a result of trying to make “me” happy.
 - Being human is a precious situation, and we shouldn’t waste time in useless activities.
 - A lot of times people do spiritual practice just for themselves. I try to turn that a little bit. I try to make spiritual practice more a part of the community. I write about infusing people with compassion.
 - The principles of Buddhism and Shambhala can be effective in helping the course of what is happening in the world.

 - Fundamentally, Buddhism is for the awakenment and benefit of beings. So, you can’t say, “Oh, you can’t have it because you’re not ready for it.” That goes against the fundamental principle.

 - The principles of Buddhism have become more commonplace, which is a good thing.
 - If we do not push ourselves enough, we do not grow, but if we push ourselves too much, we regress. What is enough will change, depending on where we are and what we are doing. In that sense, the present moment is always some kind of beginning.
 - For me, language and how I use it are very important. I held back on doing a poetry book, walking the fine line between trying to be helpful and just putting more junk out there.
