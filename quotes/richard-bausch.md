 - A good story needs only a good storyteller.
 - When you reach a place where you feel blocked, lower your standards and keep on going. There is no possible way to do permanent damage to a piece of writing. You cannot ruin it. You can only make it a little better a little at a time.
 - Mostly you write to find out what you have to say.
