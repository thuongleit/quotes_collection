 - Success in any endeavor requires single-minded attention to detail and total concentration.
 - I rob banks because that’s where the money is.
 - Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved it. I was more alive when I was inside a bank, robbing it, than at any other time in my life. I enjoyed everything about it so much that one or two weeks later I’d be out looking for the next job. But to me the money was the chips, that’s all.
 - Do not serve time, let time serve you.
