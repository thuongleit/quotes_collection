 - Everybody wants to get along with everyone else in the sandbox. I’m that kind of kid, you know what I mean? That will never change about me.
 - I love flexing theater Muscles. Television has merits as well, but there’s no substitute for live theater.
 - Acting has been the only thing so far that really gets me jazzed. It’s like my girlfriend in a lot of ways. We fight. We have a relationship, and she gets me up every morning. I’m inspired by it, and I want to one day be really good at it and see what we can do together.
 - Paintings helped to change my life. I’d still be living a life of disaster without it.
