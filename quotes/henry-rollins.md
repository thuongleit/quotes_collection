 - The scars will take me far, they always do.
 - Friends come and go but 200lbs is always 200lbs.

 - I want you bad like a natural disaster. You are all I see. You are the only one I want to know.

 - I am well protected Too locked up Inside myself To get free.

 - I have no pride about anything I have done. It’s just not the way I think about things. I do the work, always, as hard as I can, to the point of pain, injury, exhaustion, if that is what it takes. Once I am done, I move on.

 - I get tired of talking when I want to be silent.
 - August brings into sharp focus and a furious boil everything I’ve been listening to in the late spring and summer.

 - August, the summer’s last messenger of misery, is a hollow actor.

 - I could fall in love with a cruel desert that kills without passion, a canyon full of scorpions, one thousand blinding arctic storms, a century sealed in a cave, a river of molten salt flowing down my throat. But never with you.

 - For many years, I tried to make New Year’s resolutions. I made lists and shot for great heights: I would show altruism and exert moral strength, patience and all those other great attributes.

 - I do my best to limit the amount of compromise in my life so I have more time to do what I want. Not hanging out with many people really helps. I am not a people person and I spend a great deal of time on my own and in this environment, I get a lot done.

 - Misery, depression, elation all mine, refine confinement all my design.
 - I believe in North, South, East, West, The seasons, life and death, geography. That which is provable, absolute and most of all, functional. I believe in things that can kill me.
 - Is it a shame that I can’t accept love? Am I too burned out to move towards what will keep me alive or too smart to get pulled into someone else’s world?
 - We spend millions of dollars to remove pain from our lives. It’s why so many people get hooked on painkillers. The body becomes addicted to painlessness. That tells you a lot.

 - Bono actually gets a lot of substantial work done. The guy really does put a lot of things together and, while I’m not a fan of his music, I greatly applaud his humanitarian efforts.

 - There is not one single police officer in America that I am not afraid of and not one that I would trust to tell the truth or obey the laws they are sworn to uphold. I do not believe they protect me in any way.

 - I used to sit on the roof of the apartment where Jim Morrison used to write his early lyrics.
 - Entertainment’s hard on the ego. I see why actors are so psycho now. Because there’s so much ‘we don’t want you’ going on in acting. Even big people get rejected but the smaller people – they really get rejected. Trust me – I know.
 - Maybe I’m ego-tripping, but I don’t find myself a particularly horrible person, so I don’t think I need to hold back anything I think or feel.
 - In fact, every place I’ve been to in Africa has a nice part, but you see the downside. Calcutta, parts of Central and South America, I’ve seen a lot of dead bodies and a lot of sad poverty and just obliteration.
 - Some soldier will say, ‘You know, sir, you and I have some political disagreements, but I’m glad you came all the way out here.’ And you know, you say, ‘Well, maybe one day you’ll see the light but I’m glad to be out here with you.’
 - Whenever I write lyrics, in the back of my mind I always see a guy driving to work, driving to a really bad job, one of those horrible institutions, or one of those low squat buildings in Los Angeles. I write with that person in my mind.

 - You don’t have to twist my arm to work.

 - The best compliment I get every year is that a band will write me and say, ‘We were just on tour, and we had people coming to our show saying they had never heard us before they heard us on your show.’
 - The Ruts were a great punk rock band from England whose songs were as excellent as their time together was short.
 - I contribute a large amount of money to the Southern Poverty Law Center, so I’m on their mailing list for all their Klan Watch newsletters. I’m very well aware of White Power movements in America.

 - My love is a thousand French poets puking black blood on your Cure CD collection.
 - Now, if someone wants to spit on me, I just roll up the window of my BMW 540i.
 - I don’t have a crystal ball, but I’m willing to bet one of my arms right now that as long as there’s electricity, Ramones music is going to be relevant.
 - I was raised in Washington, DC, very violent place. I grew up with violence. My introduction to music was violent. The years I’ve spent on tours, some of that was extremely violent.
 - Questioning anything and everything, to me, is punk rock.
 - I’m not harmful, just introspective. You can probably think I’m weird, but it’s not harmful weird.
 - Love beyond the damage.
 - My first visit to West Berlin was in February 1983. The drive through East Berlin, the fact that West Berlin was surrounded by a wall that was more than 100 miles long – the absurdity and intensity of it really knocked me out.
 - I think that Goldman Sachs and the Pentagon determine more of America’s outcome then any president or any congress, that sounds a bit cynical, but I think I am right.
 - I’m not like paparazzi. I never force myself on anyone. I always ask, and some places offer money. And so I try and get these photos to give you, the viewer, a real look at what I was seeing.
 - The only difference between me and others is that they think they can change something with cute little poems, nice cards or embracing trees and being nice to little lapdogs.
 - My first introduction to African music was by my mother, who bought the ‘Pata Pata’ album by the great Miriam Makeba when it came out. Now that is an album. What a voice.
 - Will punk rock ever die? Pal, if you have to ask it’s dead to you.
 - When I see the hatred exacted at Mr. Obama – you know, he lowered your taxes, killed your number one bad guy and got your guys out of Iraq – I don’t understand why he seems to inflame people so much. You know, unless, unless there’s a race problem.
 - I’m most in my element on tour, with a gig that day, like today. I’m on the road where I am supposed to be. I will be where I’m supposed to be at nighttime, on stage, in front of people, doing my thing.
 - The ones who don’t do anything are always the ones who try to pull you down.
 - A lot of Americans don’t have a passport, never will have a passport. Not only will they not travel, they don’t want to travel.
 - I can deal with people who watch me on stage but I am not good in communicating with people any other way than through my work.
 - In many ways, America is on the receiving end of a pendulum that has been swung with great force, and for a long time, outward into the world. The impact is a wake-up call on every level.
 - But can a song stop a war? If Bob Marley and Bob Dylan couldn’t do it, it can’t be done.
 - I lack the skill to hold a story line for the length required for a novel or even a short story. I have never had an idea that could withstand a hundred thousand words, or even ten thousand words of rubber meeting the road.
 - With any advent in technology, any technological innovation, there is the good and the bad.
 - Fish is the only kind of respirating thing that I consume. Everything else I don’t want any part of.
 - A gun in your hand makes a fool out of you. A gun in your hand makes a target out of me.
 - Young, gay and stuck in Arkansas? Sounds like a horror flick.
 - When people hold you in high esteem, it’s very delicate relationship. When they meet you they’re putting all their chips up. It’s make or break.
 - There’s nothing new about the government protecting corporations and calling it the freeing of the world or bringing democracy to bereft nations.
 - One of the odd enjoyments in life is to be alone in a room full of people. To have them there as unknowing human filler in your wide shot.
 - Having an identity is one thing. Being born into an identity is quite a different matter.
 - And I love the hate mail I get, the unsigned, misspelled letters I get telling me to go back to Russia or wherever.
 - I spend a lot of time alone so I get a lot done. I don’t do much else but work, check things out.
 - There’s always going to be a need for activism; there’s always going to be a need for you and me doing the right thing, being very Lincoln-sonian in looking out for each other.
 - I do a lot of stuff for free anyway. Like a lot of people who you see who don’t need money. Mick Jagger – he needs money? He just likes to go sing Satisfaction every night. If I wrote that song I probably would do it too.
 - I see walking bombs on the street Hearts not beating, but ticking.
 - There is no heaven for me and no hell. And certainly not any Karma.
 - I’m trying to be confrontational and direct. If I lack directness then I only have myself to blame because I lack the skills to make my point clear.
 - Spring and fall, those are very inspiring times of the year for me.
 - For myself, I can’t understand a life without a job. I don’t know what I would do without employment. Retirement is out of the question for me.
 - Airports in major cities, like LAX, are trippy environments. It is at once a national and international gathering of those in transition: The euphoric, emerging from planes, their journey at an end, and the determined, about to depart.
 - In the late summer of 1986, the band I had been in for five years stopped playing. Suddenly, I was on my own. This new state of bandlessness was, at first, traumatic. When your group breaks up, a lot of broken parts hit the ground.
 - I live my life by the numbers. Not only am I an American, I am an Americanist.
 - If you really want a true confrontation, you treat your opponent with respect.
 - It is amazing to hear grown-up people rationalize homophobia and discrimination. The lengths they go to trying to prove their points take reason to its breaking point.
 - I get angry about stuff, I get very emotionally intense about stuff and that’s how I get it out – with books, with the band, on my own onstage, but it’s always kind of a wail.
 - I don’t cuss in songs. It’s too easy.
 - To our enemies all over the world who plan America’s demise, please take my advice. Give up now. No matter what, you will lose. You will lose it all.
 - I think it’s important to have some documentation of the past.
 - Why do you think the old stories tell of men who set out on great journeys to impress the gods? Because trying to impress people just isn’t worth the time and effort.
 - Too bad that Paul Ryan confessed to being a fan of Rage Against The Machine. By doing so, he not only begged for a bucketing by many of their fans but actually got one from the band’s guitar player, Tom Morello.
 - Imagine a 15-year-old kid saying, ‘I have two moms – it’s cool.’ I don’t fear that at all.
 - Americans are poorly served by their media, you know, for the war machine and propaganda machine and the global empire and they’re poorly served by what they are being told is representative government.
 - Horror jolts me when I look at one of you and see a pair of beautiful eyes that make me think your mind might contain a world that could hold me as the bolts shake loose and fly from my frame.
 - Rush Limbaugh makes money getting simpleminded people to feel good about their intellectually undernourished brain spasms. He’s very good at it, and I scarcely believe a fraction of what he says.
 - I was in Pakistan in Islamabad when Bhutto was assassinated, and the next day, you know, there’s just plumes of smoke everywhere. I mean, Islamabad is on fire.
 - I hate it when men go to strip bars. It lowers the rest of us that know if a man has to pay to see a woman naked, he is a loser and probably should get weeded out.

 - I’m not exactly ambitious as much as I have a very good realization of what I am and what I am capable of.
 - It’s hard to get along with people. As much as you try to like them and accept them as individuals, it becomes difficult because they keep getting out of line and wasting your time.

 - I would like to become a better photographer. I’m working on that.
 - I take the work seriously, just not myself in it.

 - In my many trips to South Africa, I have met and spoken to a lot of people there, and they all seem to find apartheid as repellent as you would.
 - I don’t have a wife, I don’t have any kids, I don’t have any addictions that keep me drooling on the couch, and I’m kind of target oriented.
 - I have been curious about Haiti for many years. The history of the country is as fascinating as it is turbulent.
 - Someone like Ashlee Simpson, she lip-synchs on ‘Saturday Night Live,’ gets totally called out la Milli Vanilli, and no one really cares that much. It doesn’t make me hate Ashlee; she’s just taking instructions.
 - I mean Black Flag happened. I was lucky. I don’t think I could have put together something with one percent of that oomph on my own.
 - The Wacken festival started more than 20 years ago with just a few hundred people in attendance. Tickets now sell out before the lineup is announced.

 - I like the idea of someone else’s love safely sealed in a song or a book.
 - My understanding of first-degree murder is that premeditation needs to be proven.
 - When you are young, there is so much ahead of you, it’s like the Saharan desert. You can’t even see across it.
 - I like the idea of going out with a woman and not doing anything, and just eating dinner and talking, and that’s cool, too. So, someone might look at me and say, “No way, man. He’s just banging strippers.” And I do that, but not all the time.
 - The easy solution isn’t the solution, it’s the problem.
 - One of the most insane environments I have ever spent time in is a gun range. There we are, all in a line, armed to the teeth, firing away.
 - Can you imagine telling a woman she can’t vote!? The women I hang out with would be going home with parts of your anatomy swinging from their rearview.
 - I don’t know if music has ever achieved anything past appealing to the people that it appeals to. If a song could stop a war, then Bob Marley and Bob Dylan songs would have stopped one or two.
 - To get a human through a life, lives of broken bones, knock-me-over-with-a-feather susceptibility to myriad viruses, and whatever else might befall someone will cost money.
 - In the summer of ’84, you just couldn’t escape the Born in the USA record.
 - Do you know why Albert Camus was so prolific? He wrote to keep from screaming.
 - Before the Civil War, the Southern states were selling a lot of cotton to England and didn’t seem to mind British occupation. By and large, the Revolutionary War wasn’t at all great for business.
 - To anger female voters in America is to tread on the tiger’s tail. Women turn out in huge numbers, and they are well aware of how their bodies work and what they need.
 - I tend to gravitate to the darkest or most obscure part of any venue in an effort to have my own space to experience the music on my own, free from unwanted conversations and other distractions.
 - Being unique is never easy, and often, by the time culture catches up with you, there are only a few people who notice.
 - I’ve been on ‘Jay Leno,’ and everyone likes Jay, but being on that show is a really boring afternoon. I sincerely like Jay, but I wouldn’t want his job, because I’d have to interview Kathy Ireland, and there’s nothing there I’d want to know.
 - In the city of Pyongyang, you don’t have to look very far to see an image of the Great Leader, Kim Il Sung. They love the guy. He is responsible for the wonder that is North Korea.
 - But I have a good life. I enjoy what I do. I am married to work.
 - If people are being upstanding citizens of the Republic, then you have to widen the net to incarcerate them. This explains why America’s prisons are full of nonviolent offenders – a perfect example of American exceptionalism.
 - I don’t want to go with the smooth skin and the calm brow. I hope I end up a blithering idiot cursing the sun – hallucinating, screaming, giving obscene and inane lectures on street corners and public parks.
 - All of the jobs have gone away to satisfy the stockholders, so that’s where the economy has gone. These major multinational corporations do not see their futures in America.

 - When you’re going into an employment environment that looks pretty scary, it is easy to lose your moral compass, your decency, your sense of civility and your sense of community.
 - All I can do is just do stuff while I am alive and hopefully that track record will speak for itself.
 - There’s nothing funny about, ‘Yeah, I took a First Class plane ticket and I went to some designer beach and made out with a Laotian slave girl.’ Who cares?

 - I plan to be a part of Haiti’s reconstruction and future.
 - I cling to my memories of glorious desperation.
 - I still have dreams about CBGB’s. I still miss the place.
 - The Internet, the camera cellphone and the like have not only sped up the world’s information uptake, but they have cheapened that which they capture.
 - I can tell you exactly where the economy is going. It’s going to China, Honduras, Guatemala, Cambodia, Vietnam, Cipan, and any other place where you can pay people peanuts and have them work like dogs.
 - I like the sound of my voice, doesn’t mean it’s any good but I like it. The joke is that “all good singers like the sound of their own voice” so we’ll go with that.
 - As long as I tell the truth I feel that nobody can touch me.
 - Before any American points a finger at President Putin and calls him nasty names, they should recognize that a lot of Americans agree with Putin on his stance against homosexual and transgender people.

 - To this day, my haircut is the number two clippers, which I apply to myself every month.
 - If I were a doctor, I would prescribe that you addict yourself deeply and irrevocably to music and never, ever seek cure outside of more music. It really is the best drug available.
 - I think I am the most impressed with writing styles that defy category, like Kharms or Selby, Breton or Jarry, where you become as interested in the writer as much as the writing itself. It’s all these things that make reading so appealing to me.

 - The arts in America exist in spite of America, not because of America.
 - Where there is young people and vitality, you’re going to find punk rock.
 - To see change in your own area code is very powerful. There’s a little orphanage down the street from my company, and we donate $1 from the sale of each CD we sell to the orphanage.
 - Seasonal change in Los Angeles is often a very subtle thing. It’s not as if we finally stop having to shovel the snow out of our driveways and can put our parkas back in the closet.
 - I wonder if it is Australia’s great distance from more populated land masses that allows its inhabitants to be left to their own devices, to be incredibly creative and, at times, to be wonderfully weird.
 - Most of the people who call me a sellout were 7 when I was down face-first in the punk trenches.
 - I would hate to think that some people have found themselves in a musical cul-de-sac and have ceased to explore new music, or at least music that is new to them, because they are so glued to the past.
 - The kid who throws his spaghetti from the high chair onto his father’s face, he’s pushing back. He’s sticking it to the man as he sees it. I like that. So that is punk.
 - Basically, men are afraid of women and can’t handle the fact that they came out of the same thing they spend the rest of their lives trying to get back into.
 - It took me until my teenage years to realize that I was medicating with music. I was pushing back against my stupid school uniform, instructors who called me by my last name and my classmates, who, while friendly enough, were not at all inspiring.
 - When I am in Africa, I realize I don’t know much, have not seen much, and there’s a lot to be done.
 - Watching a documentary with people hacking their way through some polar wasteland is merely a visual. Actually trying to deal with cold that can literally kill you is quite a different thing.
 - I got three letters today telling me that I’m god. Why can’t I pay the rent?
 - What if Americans were all judged by the actions of the Bush administration and people did not know the truth? That America is full of people who are, at present, poorly represented and poorly catered to by the media.
 - People are best on records and books because you can turn them off or put them back on the shelf.

 - For me, jazz will always be the soundtrack of the civil rights movement.
 - I have built my life to pursue the new. I don’t have family, don’t know many people and I am usually ready to leave within an hour.
 - My father did not rock. He just earned and hated. Don’t end up like this man.
 - When you start thinking as far as what’s a good photo, unfortunately everything starts looking like a good photo.
 - When you title yourself, you immediately lend yourself to all kinds of pretension.
 - There are religions and social and moral awareness in any society that gets passed immediately. Those human truths. All cultures address them.
 - I’m always looking, people are always presenting and I have found that every year of my life there’s been great bands. All over the world, all the time. So when someone goes, “Music sucks now!” I’ll go, “I don’t think so. Not over at my house.”
 - The scarcity of the music not only makes the music itself enjoyable but it also gives the collector a strange sense of superiority.
 - I’m not a singer. If you’ve heard any of my records, that’s not singing. I have no vocal qualities whatsoever. I’ve got a lot of enthusisam and I go to the cross, but there’s no skill going on there. It’s more just intuitiveness.
 - If it’s a man’s world, as they say, then men, your world is a poorly run carnage fest.

 - Life is weird, great and dangerous.
 - We Californians can watch the Weather Channel for images of winter’s brutality unleashed upon our fellow Americans and thank our lucky stars we don’t have to contend with it.
 - Russia is tough. The history, the land, the people – brutal.
 - It’s hard to keep your backbone straight in America. It’s easy to turn into that which you hate, and to get smashed.
 - I’m pessimistic. I don’t think that justice always gets the right person.
 - I’m just shallow and self-interested, and don’t get out much because I’m afraid of real commitments.

 - There is no way you are going to be forgiven for blowing up a village and killing a bunch of people.
 - I never think of what it’s going to be like later. I only think in the present tense. The only time I think backwards is when I have to reissue something.
 - I’m disappointed by bands left and right, every day.
 - I guess I am famous in a way. I would rather consider it recognizable – I think that is more logical. I don’t feel famous.
 - It’s hard to judge literary merit.
 - When I write lyrics, it’s only when I’m angry or hurt or sad. So lyrically it’s never really easy going. And the music is always really intense.
 - I really like older writers, perhaps because they take me out of my element. I don’t have a great deal of interest in reading a fictionalized present as it’s pretty insane as it is.
 - You can pass all the gun legislation you want. None of it will make me feel any more or less safe than I do right at this moment.
 - Of course same sex marriage is constitutional! The right to be yourself, to pursue life, liberty, and property, is protected several ways over several amendments. John Boehner should know this.

 - Without the blues, modern music would be nothing like it is now – not remotely.
 - Trayvon Martin did not need to die.
 - It is only our humanity that can deliver us from the brutality of our achievements.
 - I was very lucky to have had the opportunity to tour with the Beastie Boys and watched almost every set they played on all those dates. Why not? You do your set and then you get to see the Beasties play? Best deal in town.
 - I’d like to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger, ’cause I live in California and I just want to see that canned, chemical filled body in my office.
 - If there is one set of laws, one Constitution for every citizen, its protections hopefully applied equally to all, then why do the results seem to differ so radically? What do you call that? Look around – you’re living in it.
 - I’m not much of an improv guy. That’s a talent I don’t have.
 - Castle Face Records, run by The Oh Sees main man, Johnny Dwyer is always worth checking in with.
 - If you think about it, every single species is endangered. Homo sapiens at the front of the line, mosquitoes and lawyers at the back.
 - The world’s a better place since I chose music. I like the physical aspect of it, the volume and the intensity of it. It’s loud and hard. I like all that because inside me I feel like screaming.
 - I think young people should travel and travel often to other countries like I do.
 - For the last 30-plus years, I have been doing one long, uninterrupted improv.
 - Motivation has always been a fascinating factor when considering a touring artist, especially when the years stack up. What keeps one out there year after year?

 - I can only write about personal stuff, about my point of view.
 - With a book, there’s no volume to turn up. You’re very naked with a book.
 - You know, we are one nation under a god. Yes, you were right. An angry, crack slinging god who decorates with bullets and spent condoms.

 - The only safety is in the middle of total misunderstanding and deception.
 - This sounds really corny, but I am a slave to my work, a workaholic, and glad of it. I like what I do; this is my place, my little universe, one of them.

 - Life forgets me but will not let me forget Holds me down and tells me that I’m free.
 - I’ve never heard Daft Punk; I’ve never heard a track of theirs in my life. They’re the two guys with motorcycle helmets on?
 - If the death of Osama Bin Laden brings any peace to those who lost loved ones on that awful day in September 2001, that is a great thing. It is more likely, however, just a painful reminder of what was lost.

 - Half of life is up – the other half is dealing with it.
 - I guess, topic to topic, you could consider me a left-leaning person.
 - For me the music is not so much anger as much as it is of passion. And I’ve always associated that kind of intense emotional output with music just because the nature of the music that’s attracted me as far as live.
 - I was never told to “Get up, get out there, get a job.” It was never a thing either parent ever said I had to do. It was what I wanted to do. I think I was very interested in being away from them as much as possible. Employment was great for that.
 - I think more airtime should be given to Donald Trump and Orly Taitz. They should run for office together. They should open for Charlie Sheen.
 - I consider any gun that can chamber a round and send a projectile down its barrel at a high rate of speed into my body – causing me injury or death – to be an assault weapon.
 - Citizens United didn’t work. Hey, Koch brothers, Karl Rove, Shellgame Adelson: Democracy trumps money sometimes.

 - For many years, my favorite director has been the Japanese giant Akira Kurosawa.
 - I can’t remember that I ever had just a minute of stage fright.
 - You’ll never know that just sitting across a room full of people, I have transformed you into a goddess. A destroyer of despair.

 - I think Perry Ferrell put independent music on a very good path with Lollapalooza.
 - I don’t need music for the good times. I don’t have that kind of need. Music doesn’t serve me like that.

 - I’m a big Germs fan; most people are.
 - I’m most comfortable on stage.
