 - The soul would have no rainbow, had the eyes no tears.
 - The happiest heart that ever beat Was in some quiet breast That found the common daylight sweet, And left to Heaven the rest.
 - Holding occasion by the hand, Not over nice â€™twixt weed and flower, Waiving what none can understand, I make mine hour.
 - I pour into the world the eternal streams Wan prophets tent beside, and dream their dreams.
 - A breath, whence no man knows, Swaying the grating weeds, it blows; It comes, it grieves, it goes. Once it rocked the summer rose.
 - The message from the hedge-leaves, Heed it, whoso thou art; Under lowly eaves Lives the happy heart.
