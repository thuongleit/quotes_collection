 - In this world, only winter is certain.
 - All my life men like you’ve sneered at me, and all my life I’ve been knocking men like you into the dust.

 - Fantasy is silver and scarlet, indigo and azure, obsidian veined with gold and lapis lazuli.
 - You could make a poultice out of mud to cool a fever. You could plant seeds in mud and grow a crop to feed your children. Mud would nourish you, where fire would only consume you, but fools and children and young girls would choose fire every time.

 - The years leech at a man’s memories, even those he has vowed never to forget.
 - The heart lies and the head plays tricks on us, but the eyes see true. Look with your eyes. Hear with your ears. Taste with your mouth. Smell with your nose. Feel with your skin. Then comes the thinking, afterward, and in a way knowing the truth.
 - Woman? Is that meant to insult me? I would return the slap, if I took you for a man. – Daenerys Targaryen.
 - I’ve always preferred writing about grey characters and human characters. Whether they are giants or elves or dwarves, or whatever they are, they’re still human, and the human heart is still in conflict with the self.
 - Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.
 - Speak the name, and death will come. On the morrow, at the turn of the moon, a year from this day, it will come. A man does not fly like a bird, but one foot moves and then another and one day a man is there.

 - And the mystery knight should defeat all challengers and name the wolf maid the queen of love and beauty.
 - How much can a crown be worth, when a crow can dine upon a king?
 - The stone is strong. Bran told himself, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. So long as those remained, Winterfell remained. It was not dead, just broken. Like me, he thought. I’m not dead either.
 - The true horrors of human history derive not from orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.
 - I’ve lost a hand, a father, a son, a sister, and a lover, and soon enough I will lose a brother. And yet they keep telling me House Lannister won this war.
 - It’s really irritating when you open a book, and 10 pages into it you know that the hero you met on page one or two is gonna come through unscathed, because he’s the hero. This is completely unreal, and I don’t like it.
 - I don’t want to be a queen. I want to be the queen.

 - Hodor!
 - All dwarfs are bastards in their father’s eyes.
 - Let them see that their words can cut you and you’ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore.
 - He was no dragon, Dany thought, curiously calm. Fire cannot kill a dragon.
 - Arya lifted her gaze from the dead man and his dead dog. Jaqen H’ghar was leaning up against the side of the Wailing Tower. When he saw her looking, he lifted a hand to his face and laid two fingers casually against his cheek.
 - Wine makes all things possible.
 - Ten years from now, no one is going to care how quickly the books came out. The only thing that will matter, the only thing anyone will remember, is how good they were. That’s my main concern, and always will be.

 - Nothing. My father is very good at doing nothing. He calls it thinking.
 - I have done a lot of work in Hollywood myself. I worked in television for roughly 10 years, from the mid-’80s to mid-’90s. And I was on staff at a couple of shows. I did some feature films, including originals and adaptations.
 - His sister liked to think of herself as Lord Tywin with teats, but she was wrong. Their father had been as relentless and implacable as a glacier, where Cercei was all wildfire, especially when thwarted.
 - Littlefinger looked like a boy who had just taken a furtive bite from a honeycomb. He was TRYING to watch for bees, but the honey was so sweet.
 - Do the dead frighten you?
 - The gods made our bodies as well as our souls, is it not so? They give us voices, so we might worship them with song. They give us hands, so we might build them temples. And they give us desire, so we might mate and worship them in that way.

 - I will teach them what it means to put a lion in a cage, Cersei thought.
 - You’ve got a bold tongue, little man. One day, someone is like to cut it out and make you eat it.
 - You were made to be kissed, often and well.

 - We all need to be mocked from time to time, lest we take ourselves too seriously.
 - A ruler who hides behind paid executioners soon forgets what death is.
 - You little fool. Tears are not a woman’s only weapon. You’ve got another one between your legs, and you’d best learn to use it. You’ll find men use their swords freely enough. Both kinds of swords.
 - Why do the Gods make kings and queens if not to protect the ones who can’t protect themselves?
 - Minds are like swords, I do fear. The old ones go to rust.

 - She could not bear to look at him just now. If she did, she might well slap him again. Or cry. Or kiss him. And never know which was right and which was wrong and which was madness.
 - Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, yes, but brittle, the way iron gets. He’ll break before he bends. And Renly, that one, he’s copper, bright and shiny, pretty to look at but not worth all that much at the end of the day.
 - What would a Frey know of honor? – Sir Davos Seaworth.
 - Winter will never come for the likes of us. Should we die in battle, they will surely sing of us, and it’s always summer in the songs. In the songs all knights are gallant, all maids are beautiful, and the sun is always shining.
 - Jon Snow: I’m not afraid to die. Mormont: Nor life, I hope.
 - Of all the bright cruel lies they tell you, the cruelest is the one called love.

 - Noseless and Handless, the Lannister Boys.
 - Why is it always the innocents who suffer most, when you high lords play your game of thrones?
 - The distinction between literary and genre fiction is stupid and pernicious. It dates back to a feud between Robert Louis Stevenson and Henry James. James won, and it split literature into two streams. But it’s a totally false dichotomy.
