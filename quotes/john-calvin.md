 - We must make the invisible kingdom visible in our midst.

 - Unless we fix certain hours in the day for prayer, it easily slips from our memory.
 - The Bible is the sceptre by which the Heavenly King rules His Church.
 - God does not bestow his spirit on his people in order to set aside the use of his word, but rather to render it fruitful.

 - Man’s nature, so to speak, is a perpetual factory of idols.

 - Those little children have not yet any understanding to desire His blessing; but when they are presented to Him, He gently and kindly receives them, and dedicates them to the Father by a solemn act of blessing.
 - Sometimes it seems things go by too quickly. We are so busy watching out for what’s just ahead of us that we don’t take the time to enjoy where we are.
 - The vices of which we are full we carefully hide from others, and we flatter ourselves with the notion that they are small and trivial; we sometimes even embrace them as virtues.
 - Prayers belong strictly to the worship of God. Fasting is a subordinate aid, which is pleasing to God no farther than as it aids the earnestness and fervency of prayer.

 - It is evident that man never attains to a true self-knowledge until he has previously contemplated the face of God, and come down after such contemplation to look into himself.

 - Whoever shall now contend that it is unjust to put heretics and blasphemers to death will knowingly and willingly incur their very guilt.

 - The highest honor in the church is not government but service.
 - All things being at God’s disposal, and the decision of salvation or death belonging to him, he orders all things by his counsel and decree in such a manner, that some men are born devoted from the womb to certain death, that his name may be glorified in their destruction.
 - Our physical illnesses serve us for medicines to purge us from worldly affections and retrench what is superfluous in us, and since they are to us the messengers of death, we ought to learn to have one foot raised to take our departure when it shall please God.
 - Nothing is more dangerous than to be blinded by prosperity.
 - To be Christians under the law of grace does not mean to wander unbridled outside the law, but to be engrafted in Christ, by whose grace we are free from the curse of the law, and by whose Spirit we have the law engraved upon our hearts.
 - The happiness promised us in Christ does not consist in outward advantages-such as leading a joyous and peaceful life, having rich possessions, being safe from all harm, and abounding with delights such as the flesh commonly longs after. No, our happiness belongs to the heavenly life!
 - Tears that are shed in time of affliction are rarely tears of penitence, but more likely they are shed out of self pity and pain or sorrow.

 - Satan, who is a wonderful contriver of delusions, is constantly laying snares to entrap ignorant and heedless people.
 - Where God’s Spirit does not reign, there is no humility, and men ever swell with inward pride.
 - Whenever the Lord holds us in suspense, and delays his aid, he is not therefore asleep, but, on the contrary, regulates all His works in such a manner that he does nothing but at the proper time.
 - God tolerates even our stammering, and pardons our ignorance whenever something inadvertently escapes us – as, indeed, without this mercy there would be no freedom to pray.
 - I have not so great a struggle with my vices, great and numerous as they are, as I have with my impatience. My efforts are not absolutely useless; yet I have never been able to conquer this ferocious wild beast.

 - The one condition for spiritual progress is that we remain sincere and humble.

 - The real proof of spiritual poverty is to patiently endure the loss of worldly goods and without any regret when it pleases our heavenly Father that we should be despoiled of them.

 - A man that extols himself is a fool and an idiot.
 - Hatred grows into insolence when we desire to excel the rest of mankind and imagine we do not belong to the common lot; we even severely and haughtily despise others as our inferiors.
 - The only right stewardship is that which is tested by the rule of love.
 - In vain people busy themselves with finding any good of man’s own in his will. For any mixture of the power of freewill that men strive to mingle with God’s grace is nothing but a corruption of grace. It is just as if one were to dilute wine with muddy, bitter water.
 - There is no group or type of people anywhere in the world that is excluded from salvation, because God desires that the gospel be proclaimed to all without exception.
 - We should never insult others on account of their faults, for it is our duty to show charity and respect to everyone.
 - It is not lawful for you to make a compromise with God: to try to fulfill part of your duties and to omit others at your own pleasure.
 - We are not to reflect on the wickedness of men but to look to the image of God in them, an image which, covering and obliterating their faults, an image which, by its beauty and dignity, should allure us to love and embrace them.

 - Again I ask whence it happened that the fall of Adam involved, without remedy, in eternal death so many nations, together with their infant children, except because it so seemed good to God? A decree horrible, I confess, and yet true.
 - We can experience joy in adverse circumstances by holding God’s benefits in such esteem that the recognition of them and meditation upon them shall overcome all sorrow.
 - The pastor ought to have two voices: one, for gathering the sheep; and another, for warding off and driving away wolves and thieves. The Scripture supplies him with the means of doing both.
 - For earthly princes lay aside their power when they rise up against God, and are unworthy to be reckoned among the number of mankind. We ought, rather, utterly to defy them.
 - There is no wisdom but that which is focused on the fear of God.
 - We have been adopted as sons by the Lord with this one condition; that our life expresses Christ, the bond of our adoption. Accordingly, unless we give and devote ourselves to righteousness, we not only revolt from our Creator with wicked perfidy, but we also abjure our Savior Himself.
 - It is a very important consideration that we are consecrated and dedicated to God; it means that we may think, speak, meditate, or do anything only with a view to his glory.

 - The Lord has not redeemed you so you might enjoy pleasures and luxuries or so that you might abandon yourself to ease and indolence, but rather so you should be prepared to endure all sorts of evils.
 - It is amazing how much our lack of trust provokes God if we request of him a boon that we do not expect.
 - It is a promise which eminently deserves our observation that all who are united to Christ and acknowledge Him to be Christ and Mediator will remain to the end safe from all danger, for what is said of the body of the Church belongs to each of its members since they are one in Christ.
 - The name of Christ excludes all merit of our own.
 - Wherefore all theology, when separated from Christ, is not only vain and confused, but is also mad, deceitful, and spurious; for, though the philosophers sometimes utter excellent sayings, yet they have nothing but what is short-lived, and even mixed up with wicked and erroneous sentiments.
 - Let us consider this settled, that no one has made progress in the school of Christ who does not joyfully await the day of death and final resurrection.

 - So great and boundless is God’s wisdom that he knows right well how to use evil instruments to do good.
 - Christ’s intercession is the continual application of his death to our salvation.
 - There are people who are known to be very liberal, yet they never give without scolding or pride or even insolence.

 - Where is our acknowledgement of God if our thoughts are fixed on the glamour of our garments?

 - If people mean that man has in himself the power to work in partnership with God’s grace they are most wretchedly deluding themselves.

 - We must always speak of the efficacy of the ministry in such a manner that the entire praise of the work may be reserved for God alone.
 - Distinction between virtuous and vicious actions has been engraven by the Lord in the heart of every man.
 - Original sin, therefore, appears to be a hereditary, depravity and corruption of our nature, diffused through all the parts of the soul, rendering us obnoxious to the divine wrath and producing in us those works which the scripture calls ’works of.
 - Nearly all the wisdom we possess, that is to say, true and sound wisdom, consists of two parts: the knowledge of God and of ourselves.
 - That man is truly humble who neither claims any personal merit in the sight of God, nor proudly despises brethren, or aims at being thought superior to them, but reckons it enough that he is one of the members of Christ, and desires nothing more than that the Head alone should be exalted.
 - He who has learned to look to God in everything he does is at the same time diverted from all vain thoughts.
 - I have never seen either a drop of piety or a grain of truth or ingenuousness – nay, I have never found common sense in any Jew.
 - Whether each of the faithful has a particular angel assigned him for his defense, I cannot venture certainly to affirm; not one angel only has the care of every one of us, but that all the angels together with one consent watch over our salvation...

 - If God does nothing random, there must always be something to learn.

 - He makes this favor common to all, because it is propounded to all, and not because it is in reality extended to all; for though Christ suffered for the sins of the whole world, and is offered through God’s benignity indiscriminately to all, yet all do not receive him.

 - If the gospel be not preached, Jesus Christ is, as it were, buried.
 - Whomever the Lord has adopted and deemed worthy of His fellowship ought to prepare themselves for a hard, toilsome, and unquiet life, crammed with very many and various kinds of evil.
 - As by the revolt of the first man, the image of God could be effaced from his mind and soul, so there is nothing strange in His shedding some rays of grace on the reprobate, and afterwards allowing these to be extinguished.
 - It is only the goodness of God sensibly experienced by us which opens our mouth to celebrate His praise.
 - If true religion is to beam upon us, our principle must be, that it is necessary to begin with heavenly teaching, and that it is impossible for any man to obtain even the minutest portion of right and sound doctrine without being a disciple of Scripture.
