 - There is nothing more dangerous than security.
 - Knowledge is never too dear.
 - There is less danger in fearing too much than too little.
 - I call God to witness that as a private person I have done nothing unbeseeming an honest man, nor, as I bear the place of a public man, have I done anything unworthy of my place.
