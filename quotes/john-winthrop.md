 - For we must consider that we shall be as a city upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us.
 - Love is the bond of perfection.
 - For we must consider that we shall be as a City upon a hill. The eyes of all people are upon us. Soe that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken, and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword throughout the world.
 - We must delight in each other, make others conditions our own, rejoice together, mourn together, labor and suffer together, always having before our eyes our commission and community in the work, our community as members of the same body.
 - Liberty is the proper end and object of authority, and cannot subsist without it; and it is liberty to that which is good, just, and honest.
 - A woman of haughty and fierce carriage, of a nimble wit and active spirit, a very voluble tongue, more bold than a man.
 - To love and live beloved is the soulâ€™s paradise.
 - A liberty to that only which is good, just, and honest.
 - True liberty is not liberty to do evil as well as good.
