 - Can mortal prayers ensure immortal happiness?
 - Let us respect even error when it has its source in virtue.
 - How easy it is to be unknown!
 - Avarice is rarely the vice of youth...
 - Society, that first of blessings, brings with it evils death only can cure.
 - Benevolence, like religion, awes even those it cannot win.
 - Hope is slowly extinguished and quickly revived.
 - How we are born to invent our own miseries!
