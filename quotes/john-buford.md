 - I am willing to serve my country, but do not wish to sacrifice the brave men under my command.
 - They will attach you in the morning and they will come booming â€“ skirmishers three deep. You will have to fight like the devil until supports arrive.
 - It is too late, now I wish I could live.
 - If I have any choice I would prefer Western Troops.
 - Shortly after this, I placed my command on our extreme left, to watch and fight the enemy should he make another attack, and went to Cemetary Hill for observation.
 - If the regulars are to be put together, I believe they would prefer me to the other Cavalry Commanders.
