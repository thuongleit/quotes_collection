 - Vampires, fey folk, werewolves, Shadowhunters, and demons – these things made sense to Magnus. But the mundane world – it seemed to have no pattern, no form. Their quicksilver politics. Their short lives...

 - When somebody tells you there’s something wrong with your book they’re almost always right, when they tell you how to fix it they’re almost always wrong.
 - Lies and secrets, Tessa, they are like a cancer in the soul. They eat away what is good and leave only destruction behind.
 - The more you try to crush your true nature, the more it will control you. Be what you are. No one who really loves you will stop.
 - If no one in the entire world cared about you, did you really exist at all?
 - And I would do it again. I love you, Jace Wayland-Herondale-Lightwood-whatever you want to call yourself. I don’t care. I love you and I will always love you, and pretending it could be any other ways is just a waste of time.
 - I don’t want the world. I want you.

 - Every time I think I’m missing a piece of me, you give it back.
 - I thought perhaps that when you told me you did not love me that my own feelings would fall away and atrophy, but they have not. They have grown every day. I love you now more desperately, this moment, than I have ever loved you before, and in an hour I will love you more than that.
 - The meek may inherit the earth, but at the moment it belongs to the conceited. Like me.
 - I don’t know how to live in the world as a Shadowhunter without Will. I don’t think i even want to. I am still a parabatai, but my other half is gone.
 - Still I pictured having you for fifty, sixty more years. I thought I might be ready then to let you go. But it’s you, and I realize now that I won’t be anymore ready to lose you then than I am right now. Which is not at all.
 - It’s like banging my head against the wall, except if I were actually banging my head on a wall, I’d be able to make myself stop.

 - He said there are thousands of Shadowhunters, but great love comes once in a lifetime if one is lucky, and one would be a fool to let it go.
 - When you love someone, you don’t have a choice. Love takes your choices away. – Clary Fray.
 - It’s always better to live the truth than to live a lie.
 - Dear Alec, As your best friend and parabatai, I am offended not to have been asked to be your best man at the wedding. Et tu, Brutus. -Jace Alec, he really is upset. He hasn’t washed his hair in three days. -Clary.
 - The way he looked at you. I got it then. He loved you, and it was killing him. He won’t get over you, Clary, he can’t.
 - You love him as a falcon loves his master who binds and blinds it.
 - He will get through this, even if he thinks he won’t.
 - Jace, Clary thought, was the sort of person who liked it when things were happening, even things that were bad.
 - I love you. And I don’t want to lose you.
 - What I do know is that if we are born again, I will meet you in another life, and if there is a river, you will wait on the shores for me to come to you, so that we can cross together.
 - It was books that made me feel that perhaps I was not completely alone. They could be honest with me, and I with them.
 - Pain made you strong. Loss made you powerful.
 - I think I’m better than everyone else. An opinion that has been backed up with ample evidence.

 - I shall see you on Blackfriars Bridge, Tessa.
 - He’s got a great sense of humor for a guy who never says anything.
 - Too much of anything could destroy you, Simon thought. Too much darkness could kill, but too much light could blind.
 - We are all the pieces of what we remember. We hold in ourselves the hopes and fears of those who love us. As long as there is love and memory, there is no true loss.
 - Family isn’t blood. It’s the people who love you. The people who have your back.
 - Of course I can see you. I’m not blind, you know. Oh, but you are. You just don’t know it.
 - I could not tell you if I loved you the first moment I saw you, or if it was the second or third or fourth. But I remember the first moment I looked at you walking toward me and realized that somehow the rest of the world seemed to vanish when I was with you.
 - Every teenager in the world feels like that, feels broken or out of place, different somehow, royalty mistakenly born into a family of peasants. The difference in your case is that it’s true.
 - If I cannot reach Heaven, I will raise Hell.
 - It’s love, not the Battle of Thermopylae. You don’t have to treat everything like it’s a last stand.
 - There are memories that time can’t erase, Clarissa. Ask your friend, Magnus Bane, if you don’t believe me. Forever does not make loss forgettable. Only bearable.

 - Demon slayers take the subway?
 - Bloodthirsty little beasts. Never trust a duck.- William Herondale.
 - Always when Will did something to protect Tessa, Jem thought it was for his sake, not for Will’s. Always Will wished Jem could be entirely right. Each needle prick had it own name. Guilt. Shame. Love.
 - In all the world, you are what I love the most.
 - You’re a reader as well as a writer, so write what you’d want to read.
 - My heart tells me this is the best and greatest feeling I have ever had. But my mind knows the difference between wanting what you can’t have and wanting what you shouldn’t want. And I shouldn’t want you.
 - Seeing through glamour is easy. It’s people that are hard.
 - But the name Magnus Bane made him think of a towering sort of figure, with huge shoulders and formal purple warlock’s robes, calling down fire and lightning. Not Magnus himself, who was more of a cross between a panther and a demented elf.
 - Dreams can be dangerous things.
 - I’m not ritualistic about writing. I try to write as often as possible, which means that I have to be able to write in all kinds of situations, whether it’s at home on my couch, out at a cafe, or traveling.
 - I would give you everything of myself. I would give you more in two weeks than most men would give you in a lifetime.
 - If You don’t give readers what they want, they’ll be mad at you. If you give them what they do want, they’ll be even more mad at you.
 - No real lady would let a dress that might have been worn by a stranger touch her skin.
 - Hope is not an illusion.

 - I am catastrophically in love with you.
 - I love your name. I love the sound of it.
 - They say time heals all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite.
 - What’s the word for a perfectly reasonable fear of annoying idiots?
 - The measure of love is to love without measure. – attributed to Saint Augustine.
 - I would die for you. You know that. I would die without you. If it were not for you, I would be dead a hundred times over these past five years.
 - I feel myself dissolving, vanishing into nothingness, for if there is no one in the world who cares for you, do you really exist at all?
 - Jem: Come in. Jace: Where’s Brother Zachariah? Jem: I’m right here. Jace Herondale. And once more a Herondale is the object of my deliverance. I should have anticipated.
 - Words have the power to change us.
 - Love isn’t a weakness.
 - But God knows, I don’t want anyone but you. I don’t even want to want anyone but you.
 - Whither thou goest, I will go; Where thou diest, will I die And there will I be buried: The Angel do so to me, and more also, If aught but death part thee and me.
 - If there’s a thing I’ve learned in my life it’s to not be afraid of the responsibility that comes with caring for other people. What we do for love: those things endure. Even if the people you do them for don’t.
 - I can offer you my life, but it is a short life; I can offer you my heart, though I have no idea how many more beats it shall sustain.
 - My name is Sabastian. I had a father, but he is dead. I had a mother, but she is dead to me. I have a brother, and I will Bind him to me. I have a sister, and I will teach her to love me. My name is Sabastain, and I am going to burn down the world.
 - Our hearts, they need a mirror, Tessa. We see our better selves in the eyes of those who love us.
 - Let me give you a piece of advice. The handsome young fellow who’s trying to rescue you from a hideous fate is never wrong. Not even if he says the sky is purple and made of hedgehogs.
 - Go to faeries for gossip about vampires, to werewolves for gossip about faeries, and do not gossip about werewolves, because they try to bite your face off: that was Magnus’s motto.
 - It has been the privilege and the honor of my life to know you.
 - Why is it, little Shadowhunter, that your angels are so cold and without mercy? Why do they break that which will not obey them?
 - Men may be stronger, but it is women who endure.
 - Fate is never fair. You are caught in a current much stronger than you are; struggle against it and you’ll drown not just yourself but those who try to save you. Swim with it. and you’ll survive.
 - He touched her face, gently, with the back of his hand. ‘you disappear so completely into your head sometimes.’ he said. ‘i wish i could follow you.’ you do, she wanted to say, you live in my head all the time.
 - The Law is hard, but it is the Law.
 - The good suffer, the evil flourish, and all that is mortal passes away.
 - If you love someone, you’re not supposed to want them to come back. Better a peaceful sleep in the earth than the life of a zombie – not really dead but not really alive, either.
 - Women do not think with logic and discretion but with emotions of the heart.
 - Or maybe it’s just that beautiful things are so easily broken by the world.
 - The world is a wheel. When we rise or fall, we do it together.
 - I’ll take Shadowhunter, then. Because from what I’ve experienced of vampires, you mostly suck. No pun intended.
 - For five years it had been his absolute truth. Jem and Will. Will and Jem. Will Herondale lives, therefore Jem Carstairs lives also.
 - Our souls are knit. We are one person, James.
 - Drowning yourself won’t help, she told herself sternly. Now, drowning Will, on the other hand...
 - Half of your attention is better than all of anyone else’s.
 - Fire tests gold.
 - There might not be so much of a difference between the side of Light and the side of Dark as you suppose. After all, without the Dark, there is nothing for the light to burn away.
 - He had lost Will Herondale. And he did not know if he could ever get him back.
 - I keep thinking about blood, I dream about it. Wake up thinking about it. Pretty soon I’ll be writing morbid emo poetry about it.
 - If you ever meet the man who could take advantage of Isabelle, you’ll have to let me know. I’d like to shake his hand. Or run away from him very fast, I’m not sure which.
 - The best lies are based on the truth, at least in part.
 - I was alive when the Dead Sea was just a lake that was feeling a little poorly.
 - Beauty fades, but cooking is eternal.
 - Not everything that’s true needs to be said.
 - Astriola. That IS demon pox. You had evidence that demon pox existed and you didnt mention it to me! Et tu, Brute!? He rolled up the paper and hit Jem over the head with it.
 - You’re so easy to tease. And yes, your friend is just fine. Well, except that he keeps putting all my things away and trying to clean up. Now I can’t find anything. He’s compulsive.
 - Brown is a manly color.
 - I don’t do what I’m told, but I might do what you want if you ask me nicely.
 - If there were such a thing as terminal literalism, you’d have died in childhood.
 - She did not belong to Will-she was too much herself to belong to anyone, even Jem-but she belonged with them, and silently he cursed the Consul for not seeing it.
 - But you hate poetry! Yes, but you make me want to write it.
 - I get a lot of inspiration from research in mythology and folklore, I find that stories people told each other thousands of years ago are still relevant now.
 - You are not trivial.
 - It was like I saw your soul in the notes of the music. And it was beautiful.
 - Going round and around inside a dryer can be fatal, whereas pasta is rarely fatal. Unless Isabelle makes it.
 - Scrawny little mundane bastard.
 - When two people are at one in their inmost hearts, they shatter even the strength of iron or bronze.
 - Declarations of love amuse me. Especially when unrequited.
 - She had never thought about her name much before, but when he said it, it was as if she were hearing it for the first time – the hard T, the caress of the double S, the way it seemed to end on a breath.
 - That Jem makes beautiful things and I destroy them. That it really ought to be me dying and not him. I mean, what’s the point of living if you can’t even enjoy it? Yet Jem enjoys all the life he’s got. It’s not fair.
 - Every book is different with it’s own personality just like children.
 - The funny thing about mundies is how obsessed with magic they are for a bunch of people who don’t even know what the word means.
 - I think he’s jealous.
 - I love reading epic fantasies and big fat books and so I really wanted to write one. I think you always write what you want to read.
 - Sorry, are you telling me that your demon-slaying buddies need to be driven to their next assignment with the forces of darkness by my mom?
 - But Magnus, he thought. You never told me. Never warned me it would be like this, that I would wake up one day and realize that I was going somewhere you couldn’t follow. That we are essentially not the same. There’s no “till death do us apart” for those who never die.
 - Every time you almost die, I almost die myself.
 - There was an electric anger in his gaze, and a sort of challenge that made Simon long to hit him with something heavy. Like a pickup truck.
 - You have to give everyone ugly motives for everything they do, because ugly motives are all you understand.
 - One can give up many things for love, but one should not give up oneself.
 - Well I’d certainly hate to interrupt your pleasant night stroll with my sudden death.
 - You have ruthlessness in your bones and ice in your heart, Clarissa. Don’t tell me any differently.
 - While the Clave disapproves of trespassers, oddly they take an even darker view of beheading and skinning people. They’re peculiar that way.
 - Come in. And try not to murder any of my guests.
 - If only Simon were here. He could probably bore you to sleep.
 - I’ll just have them change the entry in the demonology textbook from ‘almost extinct’ to ‘not extinct enough for Alec. He prefers his monsters really, really extinct.’ Will that make you happy?
 - You’ve always been what you are. That’s not new. What you’ll get used to is knowing it.
 - When our hearts break, they break into shards that cannot be easily fit back together.
 - All I know is that I love you. And for the first time, that’s good enough.
 - I hate ducks. Don’t know why. I just always have.
 - I’ve never asked him but I’m sure he has a fairly stringent policy about random teenagers lurking in his shrubbery.
 - What I actually want to call you is a hell of a lot more unprintable than your name.
 - The only one who gets to canoodle in my bedroom is my magnificent self.
 - I knew you were crazy, but I didn’t realize that you were out of your goddamned mind!!
 - His eyes were green.
 - For this I would be damned forever. For this I would have given up everything.
 - Vampires bore a grudge longer than any technically living creatures, and whenever they were in a bad temper, they expressed themselves through murder.
 - You’d think the Angel would have been foresighted enough to give us a birth-control rune, but no dice.
 - Jace, There is no wedding! Stop Isabelle! Sit on her if you have to. Just stop her from doing whatever she’s doing or I can never come home. -Alec.
 - That’s why girls have boyfriends. So you have someone to take you to boring functions.
 - She seemed shy, yet all her attention was focused on Magnus, as if he were the most fascinating thing she had ever seen. There was no man who did not want to see himself reflected like that in a beautiful girl’s eyes.
 - The only time people turned to watch her go by was when she hurtled past them as she fell.
 - She said that you’ve break my heart.
 - Well, then, since you say there will be another life for me, let us both pray I do not make as colossal a mess of it as I have this one.
 - He’d felt like a jack-o-lantern for the past few days, as if his guts had been yanked out with a fork and dumped in a heap while a grinning smile stayed plastered on his face.
 - Sometimes carrying the burden of an upsetting truth, and hiding it, is actually a gift you give to someone else. You bear that burden, so they don’t have to, in a situation where telling them will change nothing.
 - There were some memories, though, that never faded.
 - Hey guys! Wish you were here, except not really. We’re having fun. Check it out-the pyramids! -Alec and Magnus.
 - There are ways in which we’re so alike. We’re reckless. We don’t think before we act. We’ll do anything for people we love. And I never thought how scary that was for the people who loved me until I saw.
 - I feel myself diminished, parts of me spiralling away into the darkness, that which is good and honest and true – If you hold it away from yourself long enough, do you lose it entirely? If no one cares for you at all, do you even really exist?
 - In difficult times, in dark times, some people shine.
 - His steady gaze held hers. His blue eyes were very dark, uniquely so. She had known people before with blue eyes, but they had always been light blue. Will’s were the color of the sky just on the edge of night.
 - Every meeting led to a parting, and so it would, as long as life was mortal. In every meeting there was some of the sorrow of parting, but in everything parting there was some of the joy of meeting as well.
 - Everything that happens to you matters to me.
 - Look at him. The face of a bad angel and eyes like the night sky in Hell. He’s very pretty, and vampires like that. I can’t say I mind either.
 - I loved you recklessly from the moment I knew you. I never cared about the consequences. I told myself I did, I told myself you wanted me to, and so I tried, but I never did. I wanted you more than I wanted to be good. I wanted you more than I wanted anything, ever.
 - No good sentences ever include the word ‘should.’ I should have paid the tavern bill; now they’re coming to break my legs. I should never have run off with my best friend’s wife; now she devils me constantly. I should –.
 - There are things our souls want, and mine wants you.
 - I’m not a man. I have no male pride for you to trick me with, and I am not interested in single combat. That is entirely a weakness of your sex, not mine. I am a woman. I will use any weapon and all weapons to get what I want.
 - All my life, since I came to the Institute, you were the mirror of my soul. I saw the good in me in you. In your eyes alone I found grace. When you are gone from me, who will see me like that?
 - I love you; I love you and I don’t care that you’re my sister; don’t be with him, don’t want him, don’t go with him. Be with me. Want me. Stay with me. I don’t know how to be without you.
 - I always thought I was happy being the dark star to your supernova.
 - I think of myself as a freewheeling bisexual,? – Magnus Bane.
 - No, I’m just a very naughty boy. I do all sorts of bad things. I kick kittens. I make rude gestures at nuns.
 - I’m tired of watching you be in love with someone else someone who will never love you back, not the way I do.
 - Life is full of risks. Death is much simpler.
 - Grief makes you feel alone, but you’re not. I know you don’t believe in-in religion-the same way I do, but you can believe you’re surrounded by people who love you, can’t you?
 - It’s your gift, to see the beauty and the horror in ordinary things. It doesn’t make you crazy, just different.
 - I think you were the wrong person for the Jace that I was, but not the Jace that I am now, the Jace you helped make me. Who is, incidentally, a Jace I like much better than the old one. You’ve changed me for the better, and even if you left me, I would still have that.
 - She hated that will had this effect on her. Hated it. She knew better. She knew what he thought of her. That she was worth nothing. And still a look from him could make her tremble with mingled hatred and longing. It was like poison in her blood, to which Jem was the only antidote.
 - Forever does not make loss forgettable, only bearable, Brother Zachariah to Clary Fray.
 - Wo men shi jie bai xiong di-we are more than brothers, Will.
 - I know you worry about me needing you, but I shouldn’t be with you because I need you. I should be with you because I love you.
 - I love you, Tessa, and I have loved you, almost since the moment I met you.
 - When you find a man you wish to marry, Tessa, remember this: You will know what kind of man he is not by the things he says, but by the things he does.
 - Maybe. Although I doubt most Shadowhunters get a tattoo of Donatello from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on their left shoulder.
 - Have a little faith in my magic fingers.
 - But I watch my brothers give their hearts away and I think, Don’t you know better? Hearts are breakable. And I think even when you heal, you’re never what you were before.
 - You are in love and you think that is all there is in the world. But the world is bigger than you, Will, and may have need of you. You are a Shadowhunter. You serve a greater cause. Your life is not yours to throw away.
 - Give me one good reason why I shouldn’t chop him into worthless-bastard-themed confetti. – Isabelle Lightwood.
 - So I lied to you last night. I said that I just wanted one night with you. But I want every night with you.
 - Nothing less than 7 inches.
 - But maybe you never really had someone, she thought now. Maybe, no matter how much you loved them, they could slip through your fingers like water, and there was nothing you could do about it.
 - Not your parabatai any longer.
 - Don’t make it sound like that. Like some ordinary sort of grief. It’s not like that. They say time heals all wounds, but that presumes the source of the grief is finite. Over. This is a fresh wound every day.
 - Maybe you should call him,? Simon suggested, trying not to think too hard about how weird it was to be giving a demon hunter advice about possibly dating a warlock.
 - All things tend toward entropy. The whole universe is moving outward, the stars pulling away from one another, God knows what falling through the cracks between them.
 - We are not our parents, Gabriel. We do not have to carry the burden of their choices or their sins.
 - My mom says you only need three people you can rely on to achieve self-actualization.
 - Mr. Rochester never courted Jane Eyre, Tessa pointed out. No, he dressed up as a woman and terrified the poor girl out of her wits. Is that what you want?
 - Unrequited love is a ridiculous state, and it makes those in it behave ridiculously.
 - I know it’s wrong – God, it’s all kinds of wrong – but I just want to lie down with you and wake up with you, just once, just once ever in my life.
 - Sometimes our lives can change so fast that the change outpaces our minds and hearts.
 - I’m pure at heart. It repels the dirt.
 - Despite everything, I can’t bear the thought of this ring being lost forever, any more than I can bear the thought of leaving you forever. And though I have no choice about the one, at least I can choose about the other.
 - Weapons, when they break and are mended, can be stronger at the mended places. Perhaps hearts are the same.
 - All knowledge hurts.
 - My rapier wit hides my inner pain.
