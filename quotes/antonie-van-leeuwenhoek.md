 - Man has always to be busy with his thoughts if anything is to be accomplished.
 - In the year 1657 I discovered very small living creatures in rain water.
 - Whenever I found something remarkable, I have thought it my duty to put down my discovery on paper, so that all ingenious people be informed thereof.
 - I have divers times endeavoured to see and to know, what parts the Blood consists of; and at length I have observâ€™d, taking some Blood out of my own hand, that it consists of small round globuls driven through a Crystalline humidity or water.
