 - Culture is not race and race is not culture.
 - Art should reveal the unknown, to those who lack the experience of seeing it.
 - The Sacred isn’t housed in a building or worn around your neck or something in the sky. The Sacred is the here and now we reside in, all breathing the same air, all imbibing the same water and made of the same earth with ‘the life force’ flowing through all living things.
 - I am defined by my will to survive, not by intelligence or cunning or money or good looks. The Creator didn’t see her way clear to give me those things, instead she gave me a strong will.
