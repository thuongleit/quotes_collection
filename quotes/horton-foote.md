 - Writing is the thing that props me up.
 - You have to watch out with my plays. They’re like yeast. You think they’re one thing, then all of a sudden subtext gets to working.
 - But I don’t really write to honor the past. I write to investigate, to try to figure out what happened and why it happened, knowing I’ll never really know. I think all the writers that I admire have this same desire, the desire to bring order out of chaos.
 - When you’re a writer, you have to write these stories, even if you don’t get paid.
 - I’m a social writer in the sense that I want to record, but not in the sense of trying to change people’s minds.
 - If I ever teach writing again, I’d say the first lesson is to listen.
