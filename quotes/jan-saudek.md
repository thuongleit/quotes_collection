 - I have no way of portraying the lives of others. I portray my own.
 - What I really do is make portraits of the soul.
 - I still dream of the day when I will take a photograph so beautiful that it can be called love.
 - I believe all artists, if they are not lying to themselves, must believe that the best part of their work, or even their life, is in front of them. To look only to the past and to say ‘those were the best years, when I was young’ is to say that in the future there is nothing.
