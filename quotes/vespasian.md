 - Dear me, I believe I am becoming a god. An emperor ought at least to die on his feet.
 - The body of a dead enemy always smells sweet.
 - It becomes an emperor to die standing.
 - Quell rebellion before it spreads.
 - Riches are well, if gotten well and spent well.
 - Dear me! I must be turning into a god.
