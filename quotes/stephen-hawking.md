 - We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity. We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet.
 - One can’t prove that God doesn’t exist, but science makes God unnecessary. The laws of physics can explain the universe without the need for a creator.
 - The Universe in a Nutshell.

 - Time and space are finite in extent, but they don’t have any boundary or edge. They would be like the surface of the earth, but with two more dimensions.
 - I don’t think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I’m an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.
 - If I had to choose a superhero to be, I would pick Superman. He’s everything that I’m not.
 - Love the neighbor. But don’t get caught.
 - So long as the universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a creator. But if the universe is really completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge, it would have neither beginning nor end: it would simply be. What place, then, for a creator?
 - What I meant by ‘we would know the mind of God’ is, we would know everything that God would know, if there were a God. Which there isn’t. I’m an atheist.

 - Philosophers have not kept up with modern developments in science. Particularly physics.
 - There is a real danger that computers will develop intelligence and take over.

 - I have sold more books on physics than Madonna has on sex.
 - The boundary condition of the universe is that it has no boundary.

 - It is said that there’s no such thing as a free lunch. But the universe is the ultimate free lunch.
 - The meaning in life is not out there but inbetween our ears. In many ways this makes us the lords of creation.
 - Even if there is only one possible unified theory, it is just a set of rules and equations. What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?
 - In the last 200 years the population of our planet has grown exponentially, at a rate of 1.9% per year. If it continued at this rate, with the population doubling every 40 years, by 2600 we would all be standing literally shoulder to shoulder.
 - People think I’m a Simpsons character.
 - Eternity is a long time, especially towards the end.

 - Computer viruses are alive.
 - One does not have to appeal to God to set the initial conditions for the creation of the universe, but if one does He would have to act through the laws of physics.
 - I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We’ve created life in our own image.
 - If you lined up all the cars in the world end to end, someone would try to pass them.
 - Humanities deepest desire for knowledge is justification enough for continuing our quest. and our goal is nothing less than a complete description of the universe we live in.
 - At times, I get very lonely because people are afraid to talk to me or don’t wait for me to write a response. I’m shy and tongue-tied at times. I find it difficult to talk to people who I don’t know.

 - Although September 11 was horrible, it didn’t threaten the survival of the human race, like nuclear weapons do.
 - What I have done is to show that it is possible for the way the universe began to be determined by the laws of science. In that case, it would not be necessary to appeal to God to decide how the universe began. This doesn’t prove that there is no God, only that God is not necessary.
 - Scientists tend to risk theories they admire.
 - Maybe my viriety is due to bad absorption of vitamins.

 - The media need superheroes in science just as in every sphere of life, but there is really a continuous range of abilities with no clear dividing line.
 - Or in other words, why does disorder increase in the same direction of time as that in which the universe expands?
 - A model is a good model if first it interprets a wide range of observations in terms of a simple and elegant model, and second if the model makes definite predictions that can be tested, and possibly falsified, by observation.
