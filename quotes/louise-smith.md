 - You can’t reach for anything new if your hands are still full of yesterday’s junk.
 - I enjoyed every minute of it, I traveled all over North America, racing everywhere I could, and I had fun with it. I didn’t make a whole lot of money, but if I could do it again today, I’d do it, and I think I’d make it.
 - I won a lot, crashed a lot, and broke just about every bone in my body, but I gave it everything I had.
