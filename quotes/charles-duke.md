 - Roger, Tranquility. We copy you on the ground. You’ve got a bunch of guys about to turn blue. We’re breathing again. Thanks a lot.
 - Roger, Tranquility. Be advised there are lots of smiling faces in this room and all over the world. Over.
 - It was a texture. The blackness was so intense.
 - I’m proud to be an American, I’ll tell you. What a program and what a place and what an experience.
 - Roger, we’re go on that alarm.
 - Buzz Aldrin doesn’t think we need to go back to the Moon – that we should go straight on to Mars. I’m more on the side that says we should go back to the Moon. I think there’s a lot we can utilise the Moon for scientifically.
 - The Moon was the most spectacularly beautiful desert you could ever imagine. Unspoilt. Untouched. It had a vibrancy about it and the contrast between it and the black sky was so vivid, it just made this impression of excitement and wonder.
 - I think a Moon base is not necessary to get to Mars, but I think it will be helpful. It would give you a chance to develop and mature some systems; long duration, deep space stuff; and you’re close enough to get some help, via radio from Earth.
 - We’ve been to the Moon nine times. Why would we fake it nine times, if we faked it?
 - Roger, we copy. It was beautiful from here, Tranquility. Over.
