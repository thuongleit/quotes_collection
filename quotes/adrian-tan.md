 - You will find, that when you have someone to love, that the face is less important than the brain, and the body is less important than the heart.
 - Finally, you will find that there is no half-measure when it comes to loving someone. You either don’t, or you do with every cell in your body, completely and utterly, without reservation or apology. It consumes you, and you are reborn, all the better for it.
 - It is far too easy to be liked, one merely has to be accommodating and hold no strong convictions.
 - Find that pursuit that will energize you, consume you, become an obsession. Each day, you must rise with a restless enthusiasm. If you don’t, you are working.
