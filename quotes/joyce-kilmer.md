 - The fairy poet takes a sheet Of moonbeam, silver white; His ink is dew from daisies sweet, His pen a point of light.
 - I think that I shall never see a poem lovely as a tree.
 - I think that I shall never see A poem lovely as a tree. A tree whose hungry mouth is prest Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast...
 - Things have a terrible permanence when people die.
 - There is no place in which to hide when Age comes seeking for his bride.
 - I suppose I passed it a hundred times, But I always stop for a minute. And look at the house, the tragic house, The house with nobody in it.
