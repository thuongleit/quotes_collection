 - I chose Real Madrid instead of Barcelona because Iâ€™m a winner, not a loser.
 - Reputations do not win matches and trophies, only goals can do that.
 - No one player is as good as the sum of a team.
 - A 0-0 is like a Sunday without sun.
 - Scoring goals is like making love: everyone can do it, but nobody does it like me.
 - The ball gave me prestige, gave me fame, gave me riches. Thank you, my old friend.
