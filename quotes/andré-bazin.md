 - Photography has freed the plastic arts from their obsession with likeness.
 - All the arts are based on the presence of man, only photography derives an advantage from his absence. Photography affects us like a phenomenon in nature, like a flower or a snowflake whose vegetable or earthly origins are an inseparable part of their beauty.
 - All films are born free and equal.
 - A very faithful drawing may actually tell us more about the model but despite the promptings of our critical intelligence it will never have the irrational power of the photograph to bear away our faith.
 - Every image is to be seen as an object and every object as an image.
 - Photography can strip from the world that spiritual dust and grime with which our eyes have covered it.
 - The ‘Western’ is the only genre whose origins are almost identical with those of the cinema itself.
 - Photography does not create eternity, as art does; it embalms time, rescuing it simply from its proper corruption.
