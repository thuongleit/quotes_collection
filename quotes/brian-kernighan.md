 - Don’t document bad code – rewrite it.
 - 90% of the functionality delivered now is better than 100% delivered never.
 - Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.

 - Trivia rarely affect efficiency. Are all the machinations worth it, when their primary effect is to make the code less readable?
 - Trying to outsmart a compiler defeats much of the purpose of using one.
 - As we said in the preface to the first edition, C “wears well as one’s experience with it grows.” With a decade more experience, we still feel that way.
 - If you’re as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?
 - If you had done something twice, you are likely to do it again.
