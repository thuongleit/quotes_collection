 - Baseball is really two sports – the summer game and the autumn game. One is the leisurely pastime of our national mythology. The other is not so gentle.

 - Born to an age where horror has become commonplace, where tragedy has, by its monotonous repetition, become a parody of sorrow, we need to fence off a few parks where humans try to be fair, where skill has some hope of reward, where absurdity has a harder time than usual getting a ticket.
 - Baseball is not necessarily an obsessive-compulsive disorder, like washing your hands 100 times a day, but it’s beginning to seem that way. We’re reaching the point where you can be a truly dedicated, state-of-the-art fan or you can have a life. Take your pick.

 - More than any other American sport, baseball creates the magnetic, addictive illusion that it can almost be understood.
