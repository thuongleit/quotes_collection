 - If History teaches any lesson at all, it is that there are no historical lessons.
 - A mere collector of supposed facts is as useful as a collector of matchboxes.
 - It is never a waste of time to study the history of a word.
 - History is the daughter of time.
 - What better preparation for a history which seeks to bring societies to life and to understand that life than to have really lived, commanded men, suffered with them and shared their joys.
