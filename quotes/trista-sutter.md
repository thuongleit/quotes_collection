 - My biggest pet peeve is inconsiderate people.
 - My husband is the most honest, kind, hard-working, and genuine person, and I honestly don’t know how I could ever live without him.
 - If I actively practice gratitude, I am able to keep myself grounded in the high times and lift myself up in the low times.
 - A baby fills a hole in your heart that you didn’t know was there.
 - My children are my greatest gifts and my greatest inspirations.
 - I come alive by giving back, seeing my children smile and hearing them laugh, standing up for things I believe in, achieving a goal, being there for those who need me, spending quality time with my husband, and indulging in “me moments,” whether it’s a vacation or just a night out with friends.
 - My true inspirations are my kids and my husband. I’m also inspired by stories of my extended family, friends, and even strangers who cause me to look at my life and behavior and encourage me to be the best person, mother, daughter, and friend that I can be.
 - I consciously focus on my blessings and remember what has gotten me through my past struggles: my faith and the belief that everything happens for a reason.
 - I’m also very hopeful to continue my literary journey into the realm of children’s books. To be able to read my kids a children’s book that was inspired by them would be everything!
 - My routine is really based around my kids, and I try not to hold myself to a schedule, because it is always changing. What has been the most influential thing to help me keep my center is to set priorities and stick to them.
 - I’d tell the planet to actively and consciously practice gratitude. To never give up hope. To believe in themselves and be true to who they are. To be kind. To share. To protect our planet for future generations.
