 - Nobody could ever say as many terrible things to me as I say to myself.
 - Acting is doing. The more you do, the more you learn. Work begets work.
 - To not have any hope is where things start to get really bleak. Things are possible. The impossible can be possible.
 - I could feel my body temperature – I knew I was bright red. It was so humiliating, I was so upset, and it was nothing I had planned to do. It was just one of those beautiful moments, the alchemy of acting that is so mysterious, where you sort of go, “How did that come out of me?”
 - To me, most of life kind of lives in the grey and I don’t just mean morally. I just mean kind of everything. If things were black and white it would be a lot clearer as to what to do all the time.

 - I’d love to be in the ’70s. I’d love to have a big, long wig parted down the middle with flat-ironed hair and bell-bottoms. They’re actually very flattering for my figure. The wider the leg, the better for a person with a booty.
 - All of my friends went to college and I got a job at Circle Pizza, where I worked for 24 hours. I had to call my mother four times to ask her how to spell Parmesan. I’m not kidding. I was a terrible speller. I think I was really nervous that I somehow didn’t feel right out in the world in that way.

 - The theater commitment is hard, especially in conjunction with a television commitment. That’s a big, long commitment.
 - I like the ritual of putting on my makeup, putting on my costume, doing my warm-ups. I eat the same dinner every night before I go on stage. I like having something that I can count on, something that feels stabilizing for me.
 - When I look at my career, the bulk of it has been television, and I love working in television. But there’s a speed at which you do it. You’re doing seven to ten pages a day on a series, and it’s hard to feel like you’re doing the detail-oriented work that I like to do.
 - It’s OK to sit in the Golden Globe room and look around and think, ‘Oh, Helen Mirren’s a loser tonight, so is Nicole Kidman. Meryl Streep lost tonight. Jessica Lange didn’t win.’ If you’re gonna be in the company of losers, that’s the company to be in.

 - I think it’s very important for people to not judge the people you’re playing. You have to find a way to love them because their story is theirs. I just don’t think there would be any use in that.

 - Sometimes I think on television, you use maybe a tenth of what you are able to do. So it’s nice to go, ‘Well, I’m gonna take two months and reinvest in acting and storytelling.’ You don’t get to do that on television.
 - I’ve only been to one concert in my life.

 - I’ve always really made my living in television. Television has always been so good to me.
 - I could never have thought, “I wanna play a two-headed woman.” That just never would have occurred to me, in a million years.

 - My great love is the stage because I do feel like it’s the place where, if you’re lucky and everything is firing in the right way, you have the greatest shot at being successful. I don’t mean by getting great reviews, but I mean by finding the core fo the person that you’re playing.
 - If you get on a TV show that’s successful, odds are that you’re playing the same character for as many years as the show is running, which can be its own blessing, but it can also be a curse because you’re playing the same thing and that can be tiresome.
