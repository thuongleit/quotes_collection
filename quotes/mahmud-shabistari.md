 - In the empty heart, void of self can be heard the echoing cry, “I am the Truth.” Thus is man one with the eternal. Travelling, travel and traveller have become one.
 - Each atom hides beneath its veil The soul amazing beauty of the Beloved’s face.
 - Penetrate the heart of just one drop of water, and you will be flooded by a hundred oceans.
 - When “I” and “You” are absent, I’ve no idea if this is a mosque, synagogue, church or temple.
 - The past has flown away. The coming month and year do not exist. Ours only is the present’s tiny point.
 - Every particle of the world is a mirror. In each atom blazes forth the light of a thousand suns. Open the heart of a raindrop and you will find a hundred oceans. In a grain of sand lies the seed of a thousand beings.
 - Knowing is passing from the false to the true and seeing the Absolute Whole in the part.
