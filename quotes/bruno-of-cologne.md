 - The cross is steady while the world is turning.
 - While the world changes, the cross stands firm.
 - By your work you show what you love and what you know.
 - For the unclean spirit enters easily into a man, and easily goes out from him.
 - For the devil may tempt the good, but he cannot find rest in them; for he is shaken violently, and upset, and driven out, now by their prayers, now by their tears of repentance, and now by their almsgiving and similar good works.
