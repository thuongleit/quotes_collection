 - Life is too short, so love the one you got.
 - If you only knew all the love that I found, it’s hard to keep my soul on the ground.
 - Ain’t nothin wrong, ain’t nothing right and still I sit and lie awake all night.
 - Bright light put me in a trance, but it ain’t house music makes me wanna dance.
 - But the day that I die will be the day that I shut my mouth and put down my guitar.
 - Good music is good music and that should be enough for anybody.
 - And if God’s good word goes unspoken, the music goes all night.
 - Life is one big question when your starin at the clock.
