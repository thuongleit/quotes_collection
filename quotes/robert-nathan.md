 - Give thanks for sorrow that teaches you pity; for pain that teaches you courage-and give exceedingly thanks for the mystery which remains a mystery still-the veil that hides you from the infinite, which makes it possible for you to believe in what you cannot see.
 - Where I come from Nobody knows; And where I’m going Everything goes. The wind blows, The sea flows – And nobody knows.
 - There is no distance on this earth as far away as yesterday.
 - Give thanks for sorrow that teaches you pity; for pain that teaches you courage...
