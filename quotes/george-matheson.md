 - There is an Eye that never sleeps, Beneath the wind of night. There is an ear that never shuts, When sinks the beams of light. There is an Arm that never tires, When human strength gives way. There is a Love that never fails, When earthly loves decay.
 - We conquer by continuing.
 - O Love that wilt not let me go, I rest my weary soul in Thee : I give Thee back the life I owe, That in Thine ocean depths its flow May richer, fuller be.
 - I will have reached the point of greatest strength once I have learned to wait for hope.
 - When the will is given, the battle is ended.
 - The things we do today – sowing seeds, or sharing simple truths of Christ – people will someday refer to as the first things that prompted them to think of Him.
