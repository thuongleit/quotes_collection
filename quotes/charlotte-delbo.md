 - After Auschwitz, I no longer cry at funerals.
 - I’m not alive. People believe memories grow vague, are erased by time, since nothing endures against the passage of time. That’s the difference; time does not pass over me, over us. It doesn’t erase anything, doesn’t undo it. I’m not a live. I died in Auschwitz but no one knows it.
 - I died in Auschwitz, but no one knows it.
