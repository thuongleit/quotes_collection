 - Only in Russia poetry is respected – it gets people killed.
 - My turn shall also come: I sense the spreading of a wing.
 - Logic is the kingdom of the unexpected. To think logically means to be continually amazed.
 - Where to start? Everything cracks and shakes, The air trembles with similes, No one world’s better than another; the earth moans with metaphors.
 - Perhaps my whisper was already born before my lips.

 - I love my poor earth because I have seen no other.
 - And I walk out of space Into an overgrown garden of values, And tear up seeming stability And self-comprehension of causes. And your, infinity, textbook I read by myself, without people – Leafless, savage medical book, A problem book of gigantic radicals.
 - Poetry is the plough that turns up time in such a way that the abyssal strata of time, its black earth, appear on the surface.
 - I was stopped in the dense Soviet wood by bandits who called themselves my judges.
 - A raznochinets needs no memory – it is enough for him to tell of the books he has read, and his biography is done.
