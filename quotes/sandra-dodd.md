 - Unschooling is creating an environment in which children can learn easily and naturally all the time.
 - People learn by playing, thinking and amazing themselves. They learn while they’re laughing at something surprising, and they learn while they’re wondering ‘What the heck is this?’
 - Stop thinking schoolishly. Stop acting teacherishly. Stop talking about learning as though it’s separate from life.
