 - Do what you love. It’s going to lead to where you want to go.
 - I’m probably the worst person in the world to give advice to puppeteers. My whole attitude towards puppets from the beginning was not one of love, but it was like anti-puppetry.
 - Beauty is embarrassing.
 - Art should be as inclusive as possible. That’s why I like bringing the low form of puppetry and elevating it into a sculpture form, but it’s still a puppet also.
 - But I think frustration is hilarious. One of my missions is to bring humor into fine art. It’s sacred.
