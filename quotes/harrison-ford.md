 - You may get real tired watching me, but I’m not going to quit.

 - Hard work and a proper frame of mind prepare you for the lucky breaks that come along – or don’t.

 - All I would tell people is to hold onto what was individual about themselves, not to allow their ambition for success to cause them to try to imitate the success of others. You’ve got to find it on your own terms.
 - There’s a real simple analogy. You have to perceive it from the ground up. You have to lay a firm foundation, then every step becomes part of a logical process.

 - The focus and the concentration and the attention to detail that flying takes is a kind of meditation. I find it restful and engaging, and other things slip away.
 - The basic skill of an actor is, in fact, empathy, and that’s maybe not a skill, it’s a disposition. I am an assistant storyteller. I enjoy feeling useful to a team effort. It’s my way of finding a use for myself, a utility in this world.

 - Hell of a thing when a man’s got good health, plenty of money and absolutely nothing to do.

 - I don’t think nostalgia is very useful to me. There is a story to be told, there’s behaviour to create or to bring to the screen that will help tell that story, and nostalgia is just not really a big part of my emotional package.
 - I had no expectation of the level of adulation that would come my way. I just wanted to make a living with a regular role in a television series.

 - I don’t want to be a movie star. I want to be in movies that are stars.
 - I think people only have so much interest in anybody, and if you barrage them in between the times you have something to offer them you become a personality rather than an actor – much more short-lived. I only work once a year. And that’s enough.
 - I’m addicted to Altoids. I call them ‘acting pills.’

 - Really, what are the options? Levi’s or Wranglers. And you just pick one. It’s one of those life choices.
 - I have relationships with people I’m working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn’t make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.
 - I try to preserve a certain amount of time away from the movies, so I don’t allow time to do those smaller parts that might give me an opportunity to do more seemingly ‘artful’ things. Although, having said that, I don’t feel any lack of noble purpose if I do a film that’s commercial.
