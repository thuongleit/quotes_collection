 - War is not about flag-waving and patriotism. War is about killing and death.
 - Battling evil, cruelty, and injustice allows us to retain our identity, a sense of meaning, and ultimately our freedom.

 - We live in imaginary, virtual worlds created by corporations that profit from our deception.

 - One needs solitude and quiet to think. The cacophony of modern culture is designed to make that impossible...
 - We on the left have forgotten that the question is not how do you get good people to rule, most people who rule are mediocre at best and usually venal. The question is how do we make those in power frightened of us and not be seduced by formal political processes.

 - Jesus was a pacifist.
 - Most of these who are thrust into combat soon find it impossible to maintain the mythic perception of war.

 - As the economy unravels, as hundreds of millions of Americans confront the fact that things will not get better, life for those targeted by this culture of hate will become increasingly difficult. Rational debate will prove useless.
 - The split in America, rather than simply economic, is between those who embrace reason, who function in the real world of cause and effect, and those who, numbed by isolation and despair, now seek meaning in a mythical world of intuition, a world that is no longer reality-based, a world of magic.
