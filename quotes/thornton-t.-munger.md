 - The habit of saving is itself an education; it fosters every virtue, teaches self-denial, cultivates the sense of order, trains to forethought, and so broadens the mind.
 - There is no road to success but through a clear strong purpose. Nothing can take its place. A purpose underlies character, culture, position, attainment of every part.
 - It is a sad thing to begin life with low conceptions of it. It may not be possible for a young man to measure life; but it is possible to say, I am resolved to put life to its noblest and best use.
 - If I could get the ear of every young man but for one word, it would be this: make the most and best of yourself. There is no tragedy like a wasted life â€“ a life failing of its true end, and turned to a false end.
 - Life is given for wisdom, and yet we are not wise; for goodness, and we are not good; for overcoming evil, and evil remains; for patience and sympathy and love, and yet we are fretful and hard and weak and selfish. We are keyed not to attainment, but to the struggle toward it.
 - If you are animated by right principles, and are fully awakened to the true dignity of life, the subject of amusements may be left to settle itself.
 - All truth is an achievement. If you would have truth at its value, go with it.
