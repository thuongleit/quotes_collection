 - Good code is its own best documentation.
 - The trouble with quick and dirty is that dirty remains long after quick has been forgotten.
 - Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, “How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?” Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.
 - The job of the average manager requires a shift in focus every few minutes. The job of the average software developer requires that the developer not shift focus more often than every few hours.
