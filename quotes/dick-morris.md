 - Leadership is a dynamic tension between where a politician thinks his country must go and where his voters want it to go.

 - The most basic decision a modern politician must make is whether to be aggressive or conciliatory.
 - The stronger Hillary is, the weaker she is. The more she seems like a likely presidential winner, the more difficult the senate race becomes in New York. It’s perfect.
 - Obama has had two raging successes in his term: He has slashed unemployment by persuading millions to give up hope and leave the labor force; and He has cut illegal immigration by casting the United States into a permanent job shortage. Some achievements!
 - The greater informational levels of the voters, their decreasing inhibitions in expressing disagreement, and their greater preference for Jeffersonian direct involvement, all make the need for a ‘permanent campaign’ to sell a president’s policies all the more crucial.
 - The last man to try to run for president advocating a tax increase was Walter Mondale. He lost 49 states in 1984, and the “I’ll raise your taxes” reputation haunted him all the way to Minnesota last year, where he lost his 50th state in the Senate election.
 - Now a great debate has been born. The thesis is Democratic Socialism. The antithesis is free-market capitalism. The Obama Democrats have posed the challenge. It is now up to the Republicans to pick it up and fight along these lines.

 - Bill and Hillary Clinton have one central idea in their uncluttered, ambitious minds: Hillary in 2008. Let Bush get re-elected, use the ’04 primaries and general election to clean out the underbrush of competing Democratic candidates, and proceed unimpeded to the ’08 nomination.
 - The typical presidential staff resents the vice-president even more than they do the first lady.
 - The opposing party rarely causes so much angst as does one’s own.

 - Democrats are not about to nominate anyone who backs the tax cut, and Americans are not going to elect anyone who favors a tax increase.
