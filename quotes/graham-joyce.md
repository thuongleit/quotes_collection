 - Twenty years is, after all, a long time. We are not the same people we were. Old friends, lovers, even family members: they are strangers who happen to wear a familiar face. We have no right to claim to know anyone after such a distance.
 - Recasting fairy tales has become a publishing sub-genre in itself, and has been done both well and to the point of entropy. More interesting are those works where the structures of fairytales are abandoned but the world of ‘fairy’ is imported as a delicate spice.
 - Some people feed you with love.
 - The blood in my veins is frozen but it sings of love.
 - Because two people in love don’t make a hive mind. Neither should they want to be a hive mind, to think the same, to know the same. It’s about being separate and still loving each other, being distinct from each other. One is the violin string one is the bow.
 - The overintellectualization of surrealism can be a bromide. A dream interpreted is a deflated dream.
 - The trouble with forgiveness is that some people don’t want to be forgiven.
 - The mist hung in the air like a prancing unicorn.
 - What I mean is this: you meet someone, you think about them. You’re already changing because of the way you think about them. You meet them again, you think about them some more, you’re changing again. And on it goes. You are changing right now. Before my eyes.
 - Why can’t our job here on earth be simply to inspire each other?
 - George Orwells 1984 frequently tops surveys of our greatest books: its not a celebration of poetic language. Its decidedly anti-literary, a masterpiece of personal and political narrative sequence. And its subject matter is crucial, because what 1984 shows is that language can be a dirty trick.
 - Every day the eye is subject to a thousand tiny shocks as a thousand industries compete for the eye-kick, the visual hook that will lock the consumer into product for that crucial second where the tiny – or not so tiny – leap of the imagination is made.
 - Perhaps writers should never be allowed to get together in a workplace context. It’s not like studying computer science, after all. The emotions are at large, and are shared and are questioned. There is a vulnerability.
 - Perhaps living souls had greater phantom powers than the dead.
 - It is, of course, the first recourse of every elitist to see social barbarism in others.
 - It’s just that to a lot of British people George Bush represents the worst of all things American. He’s the right-wing Christian crusader, the toxic Texan who refused Kyoto, the poll-cheat eel who undermined democracy on the back of something called ‘chads,’ a notion we’ve never entirely grasped.
 - That’s emails for ya: sometimes they’re like an arrow that hits so deep in the target, you can’t pull it out.

 - I’ve been playing ‘Doom’ for some years.
 - Repression in the human psyche is tightly bundled. When it has been pulled out of the sprung package so often it is perhaps difficult to push it back in the box.
 - If I couldn’t get published tomorrow I’d still be writing. It’s something to do with feeling so overwhelmed by this experience of life that you have to tell someone about it, and in a way that reorders the experience to make it manageable.

 - If critics of ‘readable fiction’ want literature to change the ways people dream, they need first to come down from the mountain and speak to the people.
 - I am less interested in ghosts than in people who see ghosts.
 - I have to get out once a week and speak with people or I start thinking I’m the emperor of Abyssinia.
 - I’ve been a professional writer for 20 years, and there are contours in that time, crescents and troughs.
 - Rationally speaking, blaming one’s behavior on alcohol or drugs is like blaming the ladder by which you descended into a pit, or the staircase that took you down to a cellar, for what you found there.
 - The modern superstition is that we’re free of superstition.
 - I’d defend the right for any novelist to experiment with form or language, but if people don’t take to it, don’t react by making out that they are thick.
