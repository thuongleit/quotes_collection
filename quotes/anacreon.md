 - Life is like a chariot-wheel that ever rolls along.
 - Cursed be he above all others Who’s enslaved by love of money. Money takes the place of brothers, Money takes the place of parents, Money brings us war and slaughter.
 - He who has a mind to fight, let him fight, for now is the time.
 - War spares not the brave, but the cowardly.
 - The sea drinks the air and the sun the sea.
 - How the waves of the sea kiss the shore!
 - Today is ours; what do we fear? Today is ours: we have it here. Let’s treat it kindly, that it may Wish at least with us to stay.
 - Ah, cruel ’tis to love, And cruel not to love, But cruelest of all To love and love in vain.
 - To-day belongs to me, To-morrow who can tell.
 - Thus, while I quaff the genial wine, I live mid transports quite divine.
 - My Passion uncontrolled shall rove, Doubly debauched with Wine and Love.
 - I both love and do not love; and am mad and not mad.
 - And last of all comes death.
