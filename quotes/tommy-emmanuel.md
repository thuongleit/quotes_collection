 - The thing about guitar players is we’re all like a brotherhood or sisterhood. We don’t care if you’re great, good, bad, in between or whatever. As long as you love it, then we’re all going to help each other.
 - Sometimes we woke up and feel like a Guitar Master, sometimes we woke up and feel like a complete fool. but that’s the fun part of learning guitar.
 - I don’t often get a chance to have a frying pan in the show.
