 - One wants to be loved, in lack thereof admired, in lack thereof feared, in lack thereof loathed and despised. One wants to instill some sort of emotion in people. The soul trembles before emptiness and desires contact at any price.
 - We know so little about one another. We embrace a shadow and love a dream.
 - Truth is like the sun, its value wholly depends upon our being at a correct distance away from it.
 - Nothing so reduces and drags down a human being as the consciousness of not being loved.
 - Do not go to the bottom of things, or you will go to the bottom yourself.
