 - Sometimes you have to put your balls on the line.
 - For me coaching was all about being involved, and taking the best qualities from the coaches I had as a player and moulding them into my own personality.
 - As a coach, I want players to challenge me, to question me and ask why we’re doing a certain thing, so they feel that they’re taking ownership.
 - My aim is to create a happy environment where the players are working hard, but enjoying themselves. You’ve got to enjoy yourself, and you’ve got to have a bit of fun as well.
