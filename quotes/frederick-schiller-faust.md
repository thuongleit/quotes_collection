 - There is a giant asleep within every man. When that giant awakes, miracles happen.
 - It was useless to try to corner a man who told stories. It was like trying to drink all the water in a lake to get at a bright pebble on the bottom of it.
 - Crowds of men are like crowds of sheep. Not the best, but the first leader is usually followed.
 - There has to be a woman, but not much of a one. A good horse is much more important.
