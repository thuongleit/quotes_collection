 - The work of the artist is to heal the soul.
 - Nature is the common, universal language, understood by all.
 - Intent on one great love, perfect, Requited and for ever, I missed love’s everywhere Small presence, thousand-guised.
 - Sensing us, the trees tremble in their sleep, The living leaves recoil before our fires, Baring to us war-charred and broken branches, And seeing theirs, we for our own destruction weep.
 - Meanings, moods, the whole scale of our inner experience, finds in nature the ‘correspondences’ through which we may know our boundless selves.
 - Academia is a graveyard of poets.
 - Strangers have crossed the sound, but not the sound of the dark oarsmen Or the golden-haired sons of kings, Strangers whose thought is not formed to the cadence of waves, Rhythm of the sickle, oar and milking pail.
 - Of all the arts the living of a life is perhaps the greatest; to live every moment of life with the same imaginative commitment as the poet brings to a special field.
 - Being a poet is not a job or a profession but a way of life.
 - Poetry is not an end in itself but in the service of life; of what use are poems, or any other works of art, unless to enable human lives to be lived with insight of a deeper kind, with more sensitive feelings, more intense sense of the beautiful, with deeper understanding?

 - I make no apology for writing in nature’s age-old and unaging language, of whose images we build our paradises, Broceliande and Brindavan, the Forest of Arden, Xanadu, Shelley’s Skies, or even Wordsworth’s Grasemere, which can be found on no map.
 - I couldn’t claim that I have never felt the urge to explore evil, but when you descend into hell you have to be very careful.
