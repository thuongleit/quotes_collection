 - I am walking proof of the power of prayer.
 - I’ve lived most people’s dream by playing football.
 - I can’t do the whole run but I am able to start the race and I will be there at the end when winners cross the line.
 - Not just me but every professional footballer will tell you they miss playing the game, I miss the game especially as I retired early, not because I was a bad player but I retired solely for health reasons.
