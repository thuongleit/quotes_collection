 - The witches are firm believers in reincarnation, and they say that ‘once a witch always a witch.’
 - Although I believe in reincarnation, as many people do that live in the East, I do not remember my past lives clearly; I only wish I did.
 - If I were to disclose all their rituals, I think that it would be easy to prove that witches are not diabolists; but the oaths are solemn and the witches are my friends. I would not want to hurt their feelings. They have secrets which to them are sacred. They have good reason for their secrecy.
 - Now, I simply won’t let my friends, the people who trusted me, be bothered and badgered about.
 - The witches do not know the origin of their cult.
