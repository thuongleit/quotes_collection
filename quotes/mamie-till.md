 - When people saw what had happened to my son, men stood up who had never stood up before.
 - I am pleased that I am able to stand here today and say with a pure heart and meaningful heart that I am against the death penalty. There is no purpose that it serves except to further the damage that death has already done.
 - If you have to get on your knees and bow when a white person goes past do it willingly.
 - Have you ever sent a loved son on vacation, and had him returned to you in a pine box, so horribly battered and water-logged that someone needs to tell you this sickening sight is your son, lynched?
