 - Selfhood begins with a walking away, And love is proved in letting go.
 - We do not write in order to be understood; we write in order to understand.
 - Love is proved in the letting go.
 - There’s a kind of release And a kind of torment in every goodbye for every man.
 - We who fly do so for the love of flying. We are alive in the air with this miracle that lies in our hands and beneath our feet.
 - Flying alone! Nothing gives such a sense of mastery over time over mechanism, mastery indeed over space, time, and life itself, as this.
 - The poetic myths are dead; and the poetic image, which is the myth of the individual, reigns in their stead.

 - A poet is not a public figure. A poet should be read and not seen.
 - High sprits they had: gravity they flouted.
