 - Love doesn’t just sit there, like a stone; it has to be made, like bread, remade all the time, made new.
 - Only in silence the word, only in dark the light, only in dying life: bright the hawk’s flight on the empty sky.
 - I think hard times are coming. We will need writers who can remember freedom. Poets, visionaries, the realists of a larger reality.
 - The place they go towards is a place even less imaginable to us than the city of happiness. I cannot describe it at all. It is possible it does not exist. But they seem to know where they are going, the ones who walk away from Omelas.
 - No darkness lasts forever. And even there, there are stars.
 - To hear, one must be silent.
 - We read books to find out who we are.
 - When action grows unprofitable, gather information; when information grows unprofitable, sleep.
 - What is an anarchist? One who, choosing, accepts the responsibility of choice.
 - Light is the left hand of darkness and darkness the right hand of light. Two are one, life and death, lying together like lovers in kemmer, like hands joined together, like the end and the way.
 - We decided that it was no good asking what is the meaning of life, because life isn’t an answer, life is the question, and you, yourself, are the answer.
 - My imagination makes me human and makes me a fool; it gives me all the world and exiles me from it.
 - The only thing that makes life possible is permanent, intolerable uncertainty: not knowing what comes next.
 - We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings.
 - We are volcanoes. When we women offer our experience as our truth, as human truth, all the maps change. There are new mountains.
 - We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable – but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words.
 - People who deny the existence of dragons are often eaten by dragons. From within.
 - There are no right answers to wrong questions.
 - One must work with time and not against it.
 - Fiction – and poetry and drama – cleanse the doors of perception.
 - The Earth is beautiful, and bright, and kindly, but that is not all. The Earth is also terrible, and dark, and cruel. The rabbit shrieks dying in the green meadows. The mountains clench their great hands full of hidden fire. There are sharks in the sea, and there is cruelty in men’s eyes.
 - Besides, when you say you’re a feminist it annoys the bigots and the old farts and the prissy ladies so much, it’s kind of irresistible.
 - Maybe when you meet the people you are supposed to meet you know it, without knowing it.
 - We like to think we live in daylight, but half the world is always dark, and fantasy, like poetry, speaks the language of the night.
 - To be whole is to be part; true voyage is return.
 - My world, my Earth is a ruin. A planet spoiled by the human species. We multiplied and fought and gobbled until there was nothing left, and then we died. We controlled neither appetite nor violence; we did not adapt. We destroyed ourselves. But we destroyed the world first.
 - The trouble is that we have a bad habit, encouraged by pendants and sophisticates, of considering happiness as something rather stupid. Only pain is intellectual, only evil interesting. This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.
 - All knowledge is local, all truth is partial. No truth can make another truth untrue. All knowledge is part of the whole knowledge. Once you have seen the larger pattern, you cannot go back to seeing the part as the whole.
 - There have been great societies that did not use the wheel, but there have been no societies that did not tell stories.
 - Writers have to get used to launching something beautiful and watching it crash and burn. They also have to learn when to let go control, when the work takes off on its own and flies, farther than they ever planned or imagined, to places they didn’t know they knew.
 - I am living in a nightmare, from which from time to time I wake in sleep.
 - No, I don’t mean love, when I say patriotism. I mean fear. The fear of the other. And its expressions are political, not poetical: hate, rivalry, aggression.

 - Truth is a matter of the imagination.
 - When you light a candle, you also cast a shadow.
 - What good is power when you’re too wise to use it?
 - Dragons are more dangerous, and a good deal commoner, than bears. Fantasy is nearer to poetry, to mysticism, and to insanity than naturalistic fiction is. It is a real wilderness, and those who go there should not feel too safe.
 - Those who build walls are their own prisoners.
 - I do not care what comes after; I have seen the dragons on the wind of morning.
 - We’re each of us alone, to be sure. What can you do but hold your hand out in the dark?
 - But it is one thing to read about dragons and another to meet them.
 - There’s a point, around the age of twenty, when you have to choose whether to be like everybody else the rest of your life, or to make a virtue of your peculiarities.

 - The end justifies the means. But what if there never is an end? All we have is means.
 - Greed puts out the sun.
 - I write with all my heart.
 - If you evade suffering you also evade the chance of joy. Pleasure you may get, or pleasures, but you will not be fulfilled. You will not know what it is to come home.
 - The word must be heard in silence; there must be darkness to see the stars.
 - Skill in writing frees you to write what you want to write. It may also show you what you want to write. Craft enables art.
 - What sane person could live in this world and not be crazy?
 - All of us have to learn how to invent our lives, make them up, imagine them. We need to be taught these skills; we need guides to show us how. If we don’t, our lives get made up for us by other people .
 - Sometimes you must go against the wheel’s turn.
 - The unread story is not a story; it is little black marks on wood pulp. The reader, reading it, makes it live: a live thing, a story.

 - Belief is the wound that knowledge heals.
 - Nobody who says, ‘I told you so’ has ever been, or will ever be, a hero.
 - Nothing is yours. It is to use. It is to share. If you will not share it, you cannot use it.
 - A forest ecology is a delicate one. If the forest perishes, its fauna may go with it. The Athshean word for world is also the word for forest.
 - Fantasy is probably the oldest literary device for talking about reality.
 - See, the thing is, as a writer you are free. You are about the freest person that ever was. Your freedom is what you have bought with your solitude, your loneliness.
 - The only questions that really matter are the ones you ask yourself.
 - I came into science fiction at a very good time, when the doors were getting thrown open to all kinds of more experimental writing, more literary writing, riskier writing. It wasn’t all imitation Heinlein or Asimov. And of course, women were creeping in, infiltrating. Infesting the premises.
 - You sit down and you do it, and you do it, and you do it, until you have learned to do it.
 - Great self-destruction follows upon unfounded fear.
 - If you’re a fiction writer, though, I can tell you how to let people talk through you. Listen. Just be quiet, and listen. Let the character talk. Don’t censor, don’t control. Listen, and write.
 - It is only when science asks why, instead of simply describing how, that it becomes more than technology. When it asks why, it discovers Relativity. When it only shows how, it invents the atom bomb, and then puts its hands over its eye and says, My God what have I done?

 - Men who fight wars in winter don’t live till spring.
 - Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art – the art of words.
 - Without war there are no heroes. What harm would that be? Oh, Lavinia, what a woman’s question that is.
 - The Earth is beautiful, and bright, and kindly, but that is not all. The Earth is also terrible, and dark, and cruel.
 - Fake realism is the escapist literature of our time. And probably the ultimate escapist reading is that masterpiece of total unreality, the daily stock market report.
 - I certainly wasn’t happy. Happiness has to do with reason, and only reason earns it. What I was given was the thing you can’t earn, and can’t keep, and often don’t even recognize at the time; I mean joy.
 - The same old hypocrisy. Life is a fight, and the strongest wins. All civilization does is hide the blood and cover up the hate with pretty words!
 - I always wondered why the makers leave housekeeping and cooking out of their tales. Isn’t it what all the great wars and battles are fought for – so that at day’s end a family may eat together in a peaceful house?
 - They can send death at once, but life is slower...
 - There are dance artists, painting artists and writing artists. Authors are writing artists. You can practice art in whatever medium you choose, and words are mine.

 - This is the treason of the artist: a refusal to admit the banality of evil and the terrible boredom of pain.
 - Revolution is our obligation: our hope of evolution.
 - To see a candle’s light one must take it into a dark place.
 - To oppose something is to maintain it.

 - Literacy is so you can read the operating instructions.
 - I use a whole lot of half-assed semicolons; there was one of them just now; that was a semicolon after ‘semicolons,’ and another one after ’now.
 - Great artists make the roads; good teachers and good companions can point them out. But there ain’t no free rides, baby.
 - No society can change the nature of existence. We can’t prevent suffering. This pain and that pain, yes, but not Pain. A society can only relieve social suffering, unnecessary suffering. The rest remains. The root, the reality.
 - Paradise is for those who make paradise.
 - And day to day, life’s a hard job, you get tired, you lose the pattern. You need distance, interval. The way to see how beautiful the earth is, is to see it as the moon. The way to see how beautiful life is, is from the vantage point of death.
 - Is it the gods who set this fire in our hearts, or do we each make our fierce desire into a god?
 - The reason literacy is important is that literature is the operating instructions. The best manual we have. The most useful guide to the country we’re visiting, life.
 - Belief in heaven and hell is a big deal in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and some forms of doctrinaire Buddhism. For the rest of us it’s simply meaningless. We don’t live in order to die, we live in order to live.
 - We will not know our own injustice if we cannot imagine justice. We will not be free if we do not imagine freedom. We cannot demand that anyone try to attain justice and freedom who has not had a chance to imagine them as attainable.
 - Having one king, one god, one belief, they can act single-mindedly.
 - The greatest religious problem today is how to be both a mystic and a militant; in other words how to combine the search for an expansion of inner awareness with effective social action, and how to feel one’s true identity in both.
 - Absolute freedom is absolute responsibility.
 - Where does your soul go, when you die in Hell?
 - Who knows a man’s name, holds that man’s life in his keeping. Thus to Ged, who had lost faith in himself, Vetch had given him that gift that only a friend can give, the proof of unshaken, unshakeable trust.
 - When people say, Did you always want to be a writer?, I have to say no! I always WAS a writer.
 - In so far as one denies what is, one is possessed by what is not, the compulsions, the fantasies, the terrors that flock to fill the void.
 - This is. And thou art. There is no safety. There is no end. The word must be heard in silence. There must be darkness to see the stars. The dance is always danced above the hollow place, above the terrible abyss.
 - A dangerous book will always be in danger from those it threatens with the demand that they question their assumptions. They’d rather hang on to the assumptions and ban the book.
 - I hope you are never victims, but I hope you have no power over other people.
 - My Real Children starts quietly, then suddenly takes you on two roller-coaster rides at once, swooping dizzily through a double panorama and ending in a sort of super Sophie’s Choice. A daring tour de force.
 - If eternity had a season, it would be midsummer. Autumn, winter, spring are all change and passage, but at the height of summer the year stands poised. It’s only a passing moment, but even as it passes the heart knows it cannot change.
 - I talk about the gods, I am an atheist. But I am an artist too, and therefore a liar. Distrust everything I say. I am telling the truth.
 - Stories are what death thinks he puts an end to. He can’t understand that they end in him, but they don’t end with him.
 - Gradually the healing took place, seeming as it always does that it wasn’t taking place.
 - The future has become uninhabitable. Such hopelessness can arise, I think, only from an inability to face the present, to live in the present, to live as a responsible being among other beings in this sacred world here and now, which is all we have, and all we need, to found our hope upon.
 - If you evade suffering, you also evade the chance of joy.
 - The misogyny that shapes every aspect of our civilization is the institutionalized form of male fear and hatred of what they have denied and therefore cannot know, cannot share: that wild country, the being of women.
 - What goes too long unchanged destroys itself.
 - In our loss and fear we craved the acts of religion, the ceremonies that allow us to admit our helplessness, our dependence on the great forces we do not understand.
 - Even in merely reading a fairytale, we must let go our daylight convictions and trust ourselves to be guided by dark figures, in silence; and when we come back, it may be very hard to describe where we have been.
 - A man does not make his destiny: he accepts it or denies it.
 - The danger in trying to do good is that the mind comes to confuse the intent of goodness with the act of doing things well.
 - The explorer who will not come back or send back his ships to tell his tale is not an explorer, only an adventurer; and his sons are born in exile.
 - Translation is entirely mysterious. Increasingly I have felt that the art of writing is itself translating, or more like translating than it is like anything else.
 - George, it’s impossible to correct a defective reality-orientation overnight.
 - I have no control over my writing. I have lots of good intentions, but no control. There’s a story that wants to be told.
 - Take the tale in your teeth, then, and bite till the blood runs, hoping it’s not poison.
 - The law of evolution is that the strongest survives.
 - A machine is more blameless, more sinless even than any animal. It has no intentions whatsoever but our own.
 - My soul is ten thousand miles wide and extremely invisibly deep. It is the same size as the sea, and you cannot, you cannot cram it into beer cans and fingernails and stake it out in lots and own it. It will drown you all and never even notice.
 - I have decided that the trouble with print is, it never changes its mind.
 - We need writers who know the difference between the production of a commodity and the practice of an art.
 - What else can the young be? When you are on the bottom, you must organize from the bottom up.
 - I don’t want to be a propagandist, no matter how good the cause. I want to tell stories. It’s just that the stories have to square with my consciousness as a woman and my conscience as a human being.
 - Planets were very large places, on any scale but that of the spaces in between them.
 - If civilization has an opposite, it is war. Of these two things, you have either one, or the other. Not both.
 - I was in too much haste, and now have no time left. I traded all the sunlight and the cities and the distant lands for a handful of power, for a shadow, for the dark.
 - A story rises from the springs of creation, from the pure will to be; it tells itself; I takes its own course, finds its own way, its own words; and the writer’s job is to be its medium.
 - The question is always the same with a dragon: will he talk with you or will he eat you?

 - To learn a belief without the belief is to sing a song without the tune.
 - All men were alien one to another, at times, not only aliens.
 - All or nothing at all, the true lover says, and that’s the truth of it. My love will never die, he says. He claims eternity. And rightly. How can it die when it’s life itself? What do we know of eternity but the glimpse we get of it when we enter in that bond?
 - All times are changing times, but ours is one of massive, rapid moral and mental transformation. Archetypes turn into millstones, large simplicities get complicated, chaos becomes elegant, and what everybody knows is true turns out to be what some people used to think.
 - But need alone is not enough to set power free: there must be knowledge.
 - The bond between true lovers is as close as we come to what endures forever.

 - You must not change one thing, one pebble, one grain of sand, until you know what good and evil will follow on that act.
 - It is very hard for evil to take hold of the unconsenting soul.
 - The backside of heroism is often rather sad; women and servants know that. They know also that the heroism may be no less real for that. But achievement is smaller than men think. What is large is the sky, the earth, the sea, the soul.
 - You can’t crush ideas by suppressing them. You can only crush them by ignoring them. By refusing to think, refusing to change.
 - A profound love between two people involves, after all, the power and chance of doing profound hurt.
 - The important thing is not the finding, it is the seeking, it is the devotion with which one spins the wheel of prayer and scripture, discovering the truth little by little.
 - But now his dry and silent grieving for his lost wife must end, for there she stood, the fierce, recalcitrant, and fragile stranger, forever to be won again.
 - The individual cannot bargain with the State. The State recognizes no coinage but power: and it issues the coins itself.
 - I am no more lonely than the loon on the pond that laughs so loud.
 - In that moment Ged understood the singing of the bird, and the language of the water falling in the basin of the fountain, and the shape of the clouds, and the beginning and end of the wind that stirred the leaves; it seemed to him that he himself was a word spoken by the sunlight.
 - Manhood is patience. Mastery is nine time patience.
 - The desire for power feeds off itself, growing as it devours.

 - If science fiction is the mythology of modern technology, then its myth is tragic.
 - Progress means nothing to presence.
 - When the enemy enthusiastically embraces you, and the fellow countrymen bitterly reject you, it is hard not to wonder if you are, in fact, a traitor.
 - Morning comes whether you set the alarm or not.
 - Love does not obey the mind, and turns to hate when forced.
 - To break a promise is to deny the reality of the past. Therefore it is to deny the hope of a real future.
 - Before the moon I am, what a woman is, a woman of power, a woman’s power, deeper than the roots of trees, deeper than the roots of islands, older than the Making, older than the moon.
 - The wise needn’t ask, the fool asks in vain.
 - To exhibit the perfect uselessness of knowing the answer to the wrong question.
 - The borderline between prose and poetry is one of those fog-shrouded literary minefields where the wary explorer gets blown to bits before ever seeing anything clearly. It is full of barbed wire and the stumps of dead opinions.
 - To see a candle’s light, one must take it into a dark place. This is the same as to see the good and be grateful, one must compare and contrast it with something worse – not better!
 - Alone, no one wins freedom.
 - And though I came to forget or regret all I have ever done, yet would I remember that once I saw the dragons aloft on the wind at sunset above the western isles; and I would be content.
 - Belief in the lie is the life of the lie.
 - It is hard to swear when sex is not dirty and blasphemy does not exist.
 - If you want your writing to be taken seriously, don’t marry and have kids, and above all, don’t die. But if you have to die, commit suicide. They approve of that.

 - He knew now, and the knowledge was hard, that his task had never been to undo what he had done, but to finish what he had begun.
 - All knowledge is partial, infinitesimally partial. Reason is a net thrown out into an ocean. What truth it brings in is a fragment, a glimpse, a scintillation of the whole truth.
 - How can people be anything but ignorant when knowledge isn’t saved, isn’t taught?
 - When I’m writing I don’t dream much; it’s like the dreaming gets used in the writing.
 - Compare the torrent and the glacier. Both get where they are going.
 - The fish in the creek said nothing. Fish never do. Few people know what fish think about injustice, or anything else.
 - The more defensive a society, the more conformist.
 - Her work, I really think her work is finding what her real work is and doing it, her work, her own work, her being human, her being in the world.
 - It’s not a weapon or a woman can make a man, or magery either, or any power, anything but himself.
 - And I needed a rock. Something to hold onto, to stand on. Something solid. Because everything was going soft, turning into mush, into marsh, into fog. Fog closing in on all sides. I didn’t know where I was at all.
 - Science fiction is not prescriptive; it is descriptive.
 - Claude Levi-Strauss has been a great source of fruitful irritation to my mind.
 - Primitiveness and civilization are degrees of the same thing. If civilization has an opposite, it is war.
 - What is love of one’s country; is it hate of one’s uncountry? Then it’s not a good thing.
 - Those who dislike fantasy are very often equally bored or repelled by science. They don’t like either hobbits, or quasars; they don’t feel at home with them; they don’t want complexities, remoteness. If there is any such connection, I’ll bet that it is basically an aesthetic one.
 - Freedom is a heavy load, a great and strange burden for the spirit to undertake. It is not easy. It is not a gift given, but a choice made, and the choice may be a hard one. The road goes upward towards the light; but the laden traveler may never reach the end of it.

 - All makers must leave room for the acts of the spirit. But they have to work hard and carefully, and wait patiently, to deserve them.
 - A man would know the end he goes to, but he cannot know it if he does not turn, and return to his beginning, and hold that beginning in his being. If he would not be a stick whirled and whelmed in the stream, he must be the stream itself, all of it, from its spring to its sinking in the sea.
 - When the genuine myth rises into consciousness, that is always its message. You must change your life.
 - The use of imaginative fiction is to deepen your understanding of your world, and your fellow men, and your own feelings, and your destiny.
 - Have you never thought how danger must surround power as shadow does light?
 - Readers, after all, are making the world with you. You give them the materials, but it’s the readers who build that world in their own minds.
 - Can true function arise from basic dysfunction?
 - First sentences are doors to worlds.
 - And I speak of spiritual suffering! Of people seeing their talent, their work, their lives wasted. Of good minds submitting to stupid ones. Of strength and courage strangled by envy, greed for power, fear of change. Change is freedom, change is life.
 - If I had to pick a hero, it would be Charles Darwin – the size of his mind, which included all that scientific curiosity and knowledge seeking, and the ability to put it all together. There is a genuine spirituality about Darwin’s thinking.
 - Genre fiction was looked at as a ghetto, but I wonder now if realist fiction, sealing itself off in the glum suburbs of a dysfunctional society, denying the use of imagination, was the ghetto.
 - The thing about working with time, instead of against it, he thought, is that it is not wasted. Even pain counts.
 - To think that realistic fiction is by definition superior to imaginative fiction is to think imitation is superior to invention.
 - I can never get used to the fact, though I know it, that women are born cynics. Men have to learn cynicism. Infant girls could teach it to them.
 - If a book told you something when you were fifteen, it will tell you it again when you’re fifty, though you may understand it so differently that it seems you’re reading a whole new book.
 - Suffering is dysfunctional, except as a bodily warning against danger. Psychologically and socially it’s merely destructive.
 - If your voice is heard by more people because you’ve earned some kind of name and fame, your silence on an issue of urgent moral importance is even more of a betrayal. Privilege is obligation.
 - We sleep researchers like cats, you know; they sleep a lot!
 - The literature of the emperor penguin is as forbidding, as inaccessible, as the frozen heart of Antarctica itself. Its beauties may be unearthly, but they are not for us.
 - After a long time spent learning how to write as a woman instead of as an honorary man, I was able to come back to Earthsea and write the next three books in another and newer tradition: that of questioning, rather than accepting, the gendering of power as male.
 - Happiness is based on a just discrimination of what is necessary, what is neither necessary nor destructive, and what is destructive. In the middle category, however – that of the unnecessary but undestructive, that of comfort, luxury, exuberance, etc.
 - Now perhaps an excessive dread of overpopulation – overcrowding – reflects not an outward reality, but an inward state of mind. If you feel overcrowded when you’re not, what does that mean? Maybe that you’re afraid of human contact – of being close to people, of being touched.
 - It is of the nature of idea to be communicated: written, spoken, done. The idea is like grass. It craves light, likes crowds, thrives on crossbreeding, grows better for being stepped on.
 - It is useless work that darkens the heart.
 - Injustice makes the rules, and courage breaks them.
 - To learn which questions are unanswerable, and not to answer them: this skill is most needful in times of stress and darkness.

 - Age and illness made one a dualist.
 - What is more arrogant than honesty?
 - Writers need to learn their trade, and how to negotiate the increasingly difficult marketplace. The trade can be taught and learned just as the craft can. But a workshop where the trade is the principal focus of interest is not a writing workshop. It is a business class.
 - There’s no way to use power for good.
 - If civilization has an opposite, it is war.
 - What is a body that casts no shadow? Nothing, a formlessness, two-dimensional, a comic-strip character. If I deny my own profound relationship with evil I deny my own reality. I cannot do, or make; I can only undo, unmake.
 - Time has two aspects. There is the arrow, the running river, without which there is no change, no progress, or direction, or creation. And there is the circle or the cycle, without which there is chaos, meaningless succession of instants, a world without clocks or seasons or promises.
 - In the tale, in the telling, we are all one blood. Take the tale in your teeth, then, and bite till the blood runs, hoping it’s not poison; and we will all come to the end together, and even to the beginning: living, as we do, in the middle.

 - The counsel of the dead is not profitable to the living.
 - If you deny any affinity with another person or kind of person, if you declare it to be wholly different from yourself.
 - No man, no power, can bind the action of wizardry or still the words of power. For they are the very words of Making, and one who could silence them could unmake the world.
 - I know people, I know towns, farms, hills and rivers and rocks, I know how the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a certain plowland in the hills; but what is the sense of giving a boundary to all that, of giving a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to apply?
 - You have to help another person. But it’s not right to play God with masses of people. To be God you have to know what you’re doing. And to do any good at all, just believing you’re right and your motives are good isn’t enough.
