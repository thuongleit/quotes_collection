 - Since the end of the Cold War, America has been grasping left and right for an identity.
 - The one thing that I do is take really complicated systems and subjects and make them accessible to regular people.

 - In modern American politics, being the right kind of ignorant and entertainingly crazy is like having a big right hand in boxing; you’ve always got a puncher’s chance.

 - Once you give an NFL player permission to have thoughts, you invite all kinds of mischief.

 - I try to be outraged by things that other people are just very accepting of, as though they’re normal and can’t be changed. A lot of what I write about is, “Hey, you know, this stuff is really awful, and it doesn’t need to be, and that’s why it’s so offensive.” Things should be better.
 - I mean, people who say that the Tea Party isn’t a grassroots movement, I think, are incorrect. I think in some respects, it is a grassroots movement.

 - Capitalism is a system for determining objective value.
 - In the old days, when you took out a mortgage, it was probably through a local bank or a credit union, and whoever gave you your loan held on to it for life.
