 - Man’s heart away from nature becomes hard.
 - My first years were spent living just as my forefathers had lived – roaming the green, rolling hills of what are now the states of South Dakota and Nebraska.
 - If a white man had land, and some one should swindle him, that man would try to get it back, and you would not blame him.
