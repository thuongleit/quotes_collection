 - Your limitations make you the wonderful disaster you most probably are.

 - People often can’t separate, or can’t understand, that to be funny is to be serious; it’s a way of pulling people in and not scaring them off. I think a lot of the funny stuff, underneath it, there’s a deep anxiety going on.
 - In getting older, I find myself becoming progressively more ineffectual in a lot of different ways, and part of that is down to no longer having the youthful feeling that what you’re doing has any true impact.

 - If you’re Australian, you feel it in your bones because you’re at odds with everybody else, except other Australians, in the sense that people always seem to be behaving strangely. People always seem to be behaving the wrong way, in a different way. You say things and there are silences.

 - The rock star is dying. And it’s a small tragedy. Rock stars have blogs now. I have no use for that kind of rock star.
