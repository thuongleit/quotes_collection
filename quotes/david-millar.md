 - Cycling is such a stupid sport. Next time you are in a car travelling at 40mph think about jumping out – naked. That’s what it’s like when we crash.
 - People do make mistakes and I think they should be punished. But they should be forgiven and given the opportunity for a second chance. We are human beings.
 - If you’re not at the front, you’re not in the race.
 - Cycling is based so much on form, on aesthetics, on class – the way you carry yourself on the bike, the sort of technique you have.
 - But human nature dictates that there will always be cheaters. That’s inevitable. Where there’s money involved and glory, there are going to be people that cheat, and there will always be ways to cheat.
 - I shave my legs twice a week. It’s hard the first time you do it. But I’m very lazy. For a team photo in December I just did the fronts.
 - Often the best guys are just those that can suffer longer, who don’t give up. And it’s so easy to give up, when you’re on a mountain and it’s really hurting. We go through a lot physically.
