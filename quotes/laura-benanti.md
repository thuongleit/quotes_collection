 - I have to create opportunities for myself. But the thing I really have learned is that you gain nothing from sitting around waiting for the phone to ring – you have to do it for yourself.
 - I don’t like the word “brand.” When I see people creating a brand, it feels disingenuous.
 - My biggest influence is someone I really don’t know at all: Tina Fey. Smart, funny, beautiful, self-deprecating, also a mom and a wife.
 - Some people have jobs where other people don’t clap for them. I don’t understand that.

 - I do think that there is an almost more old fashioned mentality to the way musical theatre people and actresses especially are treated.
 - Think of life and the world as a wall and that we’re all climbing up the wall. So just put one hand in front of the other, keep your eye on the prize, and then get there. And then turn around and help the other people – because you’re already there, so start helping.

 - I don’t think theater is dying, and musicals are a great American art form. We’ve got apple pie, jazz and musical theater.
 - There’s an infantilization that happens to actresses in general – musical theatre, straight theatre, television, film – we’re spoken to like children. Actors are spoken to like children a lot of the time.
 - I learned to stop saying yes because I then have to back out. I’ve been trying to prioritize my health.

 - I’m such a goody two-shoes, I don’t even taste the fruit at the grocery store. Like oh, are these grapes good? I can’t even do that. I’m that much of a rule-follower.
 - I think we’ve become a TV culture where we forget the live performer in front of us can see us. I think there is a self-centeredness that happens. There’s nothing more important than what you are doing in that moment. So, unless it’s an emergency, put your phone away.
 - I am a feminist with a capital ‘F’ .
 - I think being young in a grownup world, I think it stunted me a little bit. I had to grow up too fast on the outside, but I didn’t get to grow up on the inside in the way that you might if you’re allowed to fail more.
 - I really do love the Muppets. My sister used to call them the Muffets. She’d be like, “Can we watch the Muffets?” So anything that reminds me of how adorable my sister was, I’m a big fan of.
 - In LA you can’t tell the teenagers and the moms apart, which is so strange to me. And then it’s like, “Who is leading who?” Are the moms emulating the daughters? In which case we’re going backwards – that’s not how it goes – the mothers teach the daughters how to be. It’s a very strange thing to me.
 - Just because you’re a belter doesn’t make you funny; it just means that’s how your pipes are set up.
 - I haven’t been trying to be anything other than myself.
 - I’m such a goody two-shoes, I’ve never stolen a single thing. I would not be able to handle it. I would not be able to live with the guilt of having stolen something.

 - My parents were in ‘Brigadoon’ on Broadway when I was a couple of years old.

 - I think that every therapist that I know, including my dad and my sister, have their own issues. But that empathy is what makes them good at their job.
 - If we had an audience to play to, the performance would have gotten too big. Sizing our performances to the camera was an important journey for me at least.
 - I find human behavior to be fascinating, which is probably why I’m an actor, and I think that there are a lot of dangerous misconceptions about mental illness in our society, and I would like to be a part of remedying that – particularly the stigma that surrounds so many mental illnesses.
 - How did we go – in a relatively short amount of time – from Audrey Hepburn to Kim Kardashian? I don’t know how that happened. Like did we all collectively slip and hit our heads as a society? Why are we accepting garbage as nourishment? I don’t know what’s going on.
 - I was always a little adult. Even as a little kid, I just couldn’t understand why I was surrounded by all these kids. I took things very seriously.
 - We learn by watching. That’s what concerns me a little about the society we’re in now because so much of what we’re watching is entitled, self-centered, brats with no talent becoming very, very famous for literally no reason.
 - Maybe a young woman will go see a show by a woman, or starring a woman about women’s issues, and that will help her get to that quiet place inside of herself where she can then explore what it means to be a woman to her.
 - My favorite show tune has got to be Stephen Sondheim’s “I Remember Sky.” It’s probably the saddest song of all time I sing it to myself in the mirror. No, I am kidding. That’s the joke.

 - I think it’s good to have an old fashioned musical as well as new musicals. There’s a lot of room for different shows.
 - Well, I’m grateful for all the experiences that I’ve had.
 - I’ve always wanted to go to Austria.
 - My mother was an actress and my voice teacher, an incredible voice teacher. My biological father is an actor, and my stepfather, who raised me along with my mother, is a psychotherapist. I was always supported in creative ventures.
 - Being in front of a live audience again. I get that in my concerts but there’s nothing like being on Broadway.
