 - I feel like getting married, or committing suicide, or subscribing to L’Illustration. Something desperate, you know.
 - Without freedom, no art; art lives only on the restraints it imposes on itself, and dies of all others.
 - Truth is mysterious, elusive, always to be conquered. Liberty is dangerous, as hard to live with as it is elating. We must march toward these two goals, painfully but resolutely, certain in advance of our failings on so long a road.

 - Only a philosophy of eternity, in the world today, could justify non-violence.
 - For if there is a sin against life, it consists perhaps not so much in despairing of life as in hoping for another life and in eluding the implacable grandeur of this life.
 - When silence or tricks of language contribute to maintaining an abuse that must be reformed or a suffering that can be relieved, then there is no other solution but to speak out and show the obscenity hidden under the verbal cloak.

 - To create today is to create dangerously. Any publication is an act, and that act exposes one to the passions of an age that forgives nothing.

 - No one who lives in the sunlight of gratitude that things aren’t worse makes a failure of his or her life.

 - To know oneself, one should assert oneself.
 - To govern means to pillage, as everyone knows.

 - It’s not the struggle that makes us artists, but Art that makes us struggle.
 - Every man, and for stronger reasons, every artist, wants to be recognized. So do I.
 - In the end, we would like not to be guilty while at the same time being dispensed of the effort of purifying ourselves. Not enough cynicism and not enough virtue.
 - After all perhaps the greatness of art lies in the perpetual tension between beauty and pain, the love of men and the madness of creation, unbearable solitude and the exhausting crowd, rejection and consent.

 - I had only a little time left and I didn’t want to waste it on God.
 - The French Revolution gave birth to no artists but only to a great journalist, Desmoulins, and to an under-the-counter writer, Sade. The only poet of the times was the guillotine.

 - No code of ethics and no effort are justifiable a priori in the face of the cruel mathematics that command our condition.
 - Yes, I’m happy, in human terms.
 - But, you know, I feel more fellowship with the defeated than with saints. Heroism and sanctity don’t really appeal to me, I imagine. What interests me is being a man.
 - Basically, at the very bottom of life, which seduces us all, there is only absurdity, and more absurdity. And maybe that’s what gives us our joy for living, because the only thing that can defeat absurdity is lucidity.
 - It’s a kind of spiritual snobbery that makes people think they can be happy without money.

 - I don’t know whether this world has a meaning that transcends it. But I know that I cannot know that meaning and that it is impossible for me just now to know it.
 - Every man needs slaves like he needs clean air. To rule is to breathe, is it not? And even the most disenfranchised get to breathe. The lowest on the social scale have their spouses or their children.
 - I enjoyed my own nature to the fullest, and we all know there lies happiness, although, to soothe one another mutually, we occasionally pretend to condemn such joys as selfishness.

 - Human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose a future...
 - Madness such as this, its like trying to stop a fire with the moisture from a kiss.
 - Can one be a saint if God does not exist? That is the only concrete problem I know of today.
 - All that remains is a fate whose outcome alone is fatal. Outside of that single fatality of death, everything, joy or happiness, is liberty. A world remains of which man is the sole master. What bound him was the illusion of another world.
 - These are facts the heart can feel; yet they call for careful study before they become clear to the intellect.
 - The kingdom of heaven will, in fact, appear on earth, but it will be ruled over by men a mere handful to begin with, who will be the Cassars, because they were the first to understand and later, with time, by all men.
