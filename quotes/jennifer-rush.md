 - You and I are the sum of a void left by the absence of someone we love.
 - You’re the only person I trust. That’s not something to waste.
 - Hope is a waking dream.? I let the words echo in my head. The quote reminded me of that feeling you get when you start to wake from a dream you don’t want to leave. That crushing sensation in the center of your chest, like you are losing an important piece of yourself you won’t ever get back.
