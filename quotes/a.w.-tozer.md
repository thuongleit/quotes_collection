 - It is doubtful whether God can bless a man greatly until He has hurt him deeply.
 - Refuse to be average. Let your heart soar as high as it will.
 - Jesus calls us to his rest, and meekness is His method. The meek man cares not at all who is greater than he, for he has long ago decided that the esteem of the world is not worth the effort.
 - The man who would truly know God must give time to Him.
 - The reason why many are still troubled, still seeking, still making little forward progress is because they haven’t yet come to the end of themselves. We’re still trying to give orders, and interfering with God’s work within us.
 - Faith is the gaze of a soul upon a saving God.
 - To have found God and still to pursue Him is the soul’s paradox of love.
 - When you kill time, remember that it has no resurrection.
 - We need never shout across the spaces to an absent God. He is nearer than our own soul, closer than our most secret thoughts.
