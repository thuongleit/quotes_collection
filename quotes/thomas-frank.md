 - Yes, Democrats can prove that America pays more for health care than other countries; yes, they have won the dispute that private health insurance is needlessly expensive. But what they’ve lost is the argument that we are a society.
 - This aesthetic quality, then, is what politics is all about. It’s authenticity that separates winners from losers, good politics from bad, and he-man leader-types from consultant-directed puppet-boys.
 - For-profit higher education is today a booming industry, feeding on the student loans handed out to the desperate.
 - Media bias has been a favorite theme of the Right for decades, of course.

 - Surrogate motherhood has been the subject of much philosophical and political dispute over the years.
 - Governing was always difficult for conservatives, but as they return to the opposition, they are rediscovering their skill at blame evasion.
 - Above all else stands the burning question of bipartisanship. Whatever else the politicians might say they’re about, our news analysts know that this is the true object of the nation’s desire, the topic to which those slippery presidential spokesmen need always to be dragged back.
 - Whereas liberals are thought to erupt self-righteously whenever they feel like it, conservatives believe that they themselves are never permitted to say what they really think.

 - The thing now is to seem concerned in a vaguely social-democratic way.
 - Under the administration of George W. Bush, you will recall, federal spending grew pretty significantly. At the same time, the number of people directly employed by the federal government shrank. One of the factors that explained the difference was contracting.
