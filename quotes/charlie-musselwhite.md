 - The harmonica is the most voice-like instrument, you can make it wail, feel happy, or cry. It’s like singing the blues without words.
 - It is secular spiritual music, the gospel blues. It’s music from the heart instead of the head.
 - Sometimes the spirit is playing you. I call it following the will of the music, and when that feeling shows up, you just go with it. It’s almost like I’m a bystander. I’m watching this happening, and it’s not a mental process. It’s just spontaneous.
 - To me, the harmonica is like a voice.
 - Some players, they have all their licks memorized. They think about what they’re going to play, but I try to think about what not to play. Tone and phrasing, that’s what’s important – less is more. The feeling, that’s the thing.
 - I love the music, but being on the road ain’t a piece of cake, but it is real rewarding. You’ve got to – all those people can’t come to my house, so I’ve got to go out on the road and play for them.
