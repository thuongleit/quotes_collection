 - Wasn’t that the point of life? To find someone to share it with? And if you got that part right, how far wrong could you go? If you were standing next to the person you loved more than everything else, wasn’t everything else just scenery?
 - You think that holding someone hard will bring them closer. You think that you can hold them so hard that you’ll still feel them, embossed on you, when you pull away. Every time Eleanor pulled away from Park, she felt the gasping loss of him.

 - She’d majored in English, hoping that meant she could spend the next four years reading and writing. And maybe the next four years after that.
 - You can park your snark at the gate, Omaha.
 - I object to every single thing you just said.
 - I don’t know if I even believe in that anymore. The right guy. The perfect guy. The one. I’ve lost faith in “the”. How do you feel about “a” and “an”? Indifferent. So you’re considering a life without articles?
 - And because I’m so out of control, I can’t help myself. I’m not even mine anymore, I’m yours, and what if you decide that you don’t want me? How could you want me like I want you?
 - Don’t make me angry-kiss you.
 - I just can’t believe that life would give us to each other,’ he said, ‘and then take it back.’ ‘I can,’ she said. ‘Life’s a bastard.

 - You’re a kaleidoscope, you change every time I look away.
 - Park was never going to love her more than he did on the day they said goodbye. And she couldn’t bear to think of him loving her less.
 - If you don’t want people to look at you, Park had thought at the time, don’t wear fishing lures in your hair. Her jewelry box must look like a junk drawer.

 - She wanted to lose herself in him. To tie his arms around her like a tourniquet. If she showed him how much she needed him, he’d run away.

 - But he kept finding new pockets of shallow inside himself. He kept finding new ways to betray her.
