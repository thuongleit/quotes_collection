 - We mothers rock into the heart of the world the melody of peace.
 - To me, a fairy tale seems to have become reality.
 - Instead of a homeland I hold the metamorphoses of the world.
 - But silence is where victims dwell.
 - World, they have taken the small children like butterflies and thrown them, beating their wings, into the fire â€“.
 - We breathed the air of freedom without knowing the language or any person.
