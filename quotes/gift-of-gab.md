 - Doing a show is very similar to what meditation is supposed to be: being there and being present in that space and time.
 - Music is how I get free. It’s a way to shut the rest of the world down and create your own world within it. I’m not thinking about what’s going on around me. It’s definitely an energy thing, and I’m in a zone.
 - Until the day I don’t breathe, I will create music.
