 - Tradition does not mean to look after the ash, but to keep the flame alive.
 - Revolutions can no longer be achieved by minorities. No matter how energetic and intelligent a minority may be, it is not enough, in modern times at least, to make a revolution. The cooperation of a majority, and a large majority too, is needed.
 - Violence is the sign of temporary weakness.
 - We can take from the past its fires, and not its ashes.
