 - To understand bad taste one must have very good taste.
 - Anytime you make someone laugh or satirize something, it’s the best way to change someone’s opinion because they’re defenseless – they laugh, they listen.
 - People that pick up hitchhikers I believe are basically good people that believe in other people and understand problems and don’t judge people. That’s always the kind of person I’m looking for.
 - I like rap music. But bragging about being rich to poor people is really offensive. I want to hear a rap song about buying a Cy Twombly painting or dating a museum curator. I want to hear about that kind of rich.

 - Technique is nothing more than failed style.

 - The only time I had a normal boyfriend was during the time of AIDS, so maybe that saved me. It’s certainly not karma.
 - Maybe there is no better novel in the world than Denton Welch’s In Youth Is Pleasure. Just holding it in my hands, so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger.
 - I live in San Francisco, I live in Provincetown. They’re all the same, apart from Baltimore. Baltimore’s the only cheap place left.

 - Not wanting anyone to pop my bubble by speaking to me, I immediately began reading Lesbian Nuns, and that did the trick. No one attempted small talk.

 - I also hate those holidays that fall on a Monday where you don’t get mail, those fake holidays like Columbus Day. What did Christopher Columbus do, discover America? If he hadn’t, somebody else would have and we’d still be here. Big deal.
 - It wasn’t until I started reading and found books they wouldn’t let us read in school that I discovered you could be insane and happy and have a good life without being like everybody else.
 - I liked speed. I was on black beauties all the time. Nothing bad happened to me. I didn’t become a drug addict because I always had to make a movie. We weren’t stoned when we made them; I was stoned when I made movies up. I did them all.
 - If I died tomorrow I’ve accomplished what I set out to do in my life. I enjoy making my movies, I enjoy doing what I do. I have a nice life.
 - Catholics have more extreme sex lives because they’re taught that pleasure is bad for you. Who thinks it’s normal to kneel down to a naked man who’s nailed to a cross? It’s like a bad leather bar.
 - I don’t trust anyone that hasn’t been to jail at least once in their life.
 - I could never kill myself. I approve of suicide if you have horrible health. Otherwise it’s the ultimate hissy fit.
 - I get dumber as the day goes along. Every second of the day that goes along, I get stupider.
 - A lot of kids are moving to Baltimore, because we have a great music scene and we’ve got edge. Come on down, we’ve got scary edge. But great edge – it’s still a city you can be a bohemian in.
 - No comedy should be longer than 90 minutes. There’s no such thing as a good long joke.

 - I think social justice is important. I think it’s not fair.
 - If your kid comes out of the bedroom and says he just shut down the government, he should have an outfit for that.
 - I’m for gay marriage. I don’t want to do it, but I certainly think people should be allowed to, and I wouldn’t vote for anybody that would be against it. But at the same time, why do we have to be good now? Why can’t we be villains in movies?
 - Life is a rotten lottery.
 - Fame is protection if you go to a scary place. Fame is fun. A lot of people don’t say anything and you don’t know they know who you are.

 - I can’t tell the difference between the best and the worst ’cause I realize not everybody wants to have sex in the middle of a demolition derby race in the car.
 - The anger I have about high school – which I do have because they discouraged every interest I ever had; actually I call it anti-education – that anger led to my career.

 - You see a kid making a film on a cell phone. He doesn’t know what he’s doing either. But it comes out kind of good.

 - No matter what your sexual preference or gender, no one likes a man who is fussy about his looks. You can spend as much time as you want looking good. But don’t do it in public.

 - An underground hit didn’t make any money and it cost a dollar to get in.
 - I didn’t become a drug addict because I always had to make a movie.

 - I go to colleges all the time in America, and everyone’s gay, and I think how can this be? And it’s only in rich schools. In poor schools, nobody’s gay.
 - I’m trying to do of a certain attitude in life. I’m against separatism. I’m for everyone to gather. I’m for everyone lunatic to hang out together. I want to hear somebody else’s bad night, not just mine.
 - My favorite characters are people who think they’re normal but they’re not. I live in Baltimore, and it’s full of people like that. I’ve also lived in New York, which is full of people who think they’re crazy, but they’re completely normal.
 - Valentine’s Day is my mother’s birthday. If I’m wildly in love, I’ve sent people chicken hearts, which seems to appeal to the kind of person that I’ve been in love with.

 - I make independent movies. I don’t know how to do anything else. I don’t know any other job that I could really get.

 - How could you think of such awful things? liberal critics always ask. How else could I possibly amuse myself? I always wonder.
 - Well cult is a word you would never say in Hollywood. In any film business, if you’re trying to get your next film made, you would never say, “Oh, my last film was a cult film.” I’d say, “Oh great, well I hope this one isn’t!”
 - It isn’t enough to shock. It’s easy to shock. Real surprise is what I’m after.
