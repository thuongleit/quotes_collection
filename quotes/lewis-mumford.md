 - The timelessness of art is its capacity to represent the transformation of endless becoming into being.
 - Only when love takes the lead will the earth, and life on earth, be safe again. And not until then.
 - By his very success in inventing labor-saving devices, modern man has manufactured an abyss of boredom that only the privileged classes in earlier civilizations have ever fathomed.
 - Today, the degradation of the inner life is symbolized by the fact that the only place sacred from interruption is the private toilet.
 - The city is a fact in nature, like a cave, a run of mackerel or an ant-heap. But it is also a conscious work of art, and it holds within its communal framework many simpler and more personal forms of art. Mind takes form in the city; and in turn, urban forms condition mind.
 - Idealism and science continue to function in separate compartments; and yet ‘the happiness of man on earth’ depends upon their combination.
 - Every transformation of humanity has rested upon deep stirrings and intuitions, whose rationalized expression takes the form of a new picture of the cosmos and the nature of the human.

 - If we never met again in our lives I should feel that somehow the whole adventure of existence was justified by my having met you.
 - Above all we need, particularly as children, the reassuring presence of a visible community, an intimate group that enfolds us with understanding and love, and that becomes an object of our spontaneous loyalty, as a criterion and point of reference for the rest of the human race.
 - New York is the perfect model of a city, not the model of a perfect city.
 - A day spent without the sight or sound of beauty, the contemplation of mystery, or the search of truth or perfection is a poverty-stricken day; and a succession of such days is fatal to human life.
 - Nothing is unthinkable, nothing impossible to the balanced person, provided it comes out of the needs of life and is dedicated to life’s further development.
 - Moment to moment, it turns out, is not God’s conception, or nature’s. It is man conversing with himself about and through a piece of machinery he created.“We effectively became “time-keepers, and then time-savers, and now time-servers” with the invention of the clock.”
 - In our entrancement with the motorcar, we have forgotten how much more efficient and how much more flexible the footwalker is.
 - The ultimate gift of conscious life is a sense of the mystery that encompasses it.
 - One of the functions of intelligence is to take account of the dangers that come from trusting solely to the intelligence.

 - A man of courage never needs weapons, but he may need bail.
 - To curb the machine and limit art to handicraft is a denial of opportunity.

 - The great city is the best organ of memory man has yet created.
 - Geneva has the sleepy tidiness of a man who combs his hair while yet in his pyjamas.
 - We must give as much weight to the arousal of the emotions and to the expression of moral and aesthetic values as we now give to science, to invention, to practical organization. One without the other is impotent.
 - It has not been for nothing that the word has remained man’s principal toy and tool: without the meanings and values it sustains, all man’s other tools would be worthless.
 - The settlement of America had its origins in the unsettlement of Europe. America came into existence when the European was already so distant from the ancient ideas and ways of his birthplace that the whole span of the Atlantic did not widen the gulf.
 - The chief enemy of peace is the spirit of unreason itself: an inability to conceive alternatives, an unwillingness to reconsider old prejudices, to part with ideological obsessions, to entertain new ideas or to improve new plans.

 - Our national flower is the concrete cloverleaf.
 - What plethora of material goods can possibly atone for a waking life so humanly belittling, if not degrading, as the push-button tasks left to human performers?

 - One’s worst enormities remain within, and it is only one’s vulgar commonplaces of error and folly that turn into murders and suicides, treasons, infidelities, and betrayals.
 - The humanities and science are not in inherent conflict but have become separated in the twentieth century. Now their essential unity must be re-emphasized, so that twentieth-century multiplicity may become twentieth-century unity.

 - Every work of art is an abstraction from time; it denies the reality of change and decay and death.
 - War is the supreme drama of a completely mechanized society.
 - The vast material displacements the machine has made in our physical environment are perhaps in the long run less important than its spiritual contributions to our culture.
 - Humor is our way of defending ourselves from life’s absurdities by thinking absurdly about them.
 - The earth is the Lord’s fullness thereof: this is no longer a hollow dictum of religion, but a directive for economic action toward human brotherhood.
 - In its revolt against congestion and sordor, a space-hungry generation has, I fear, developed eyes that are bigger than its stomach.
 - Each person is a temporary focus of forces, vitalities, and values that carry back to an immemorial past and that reach forward into an unthinkable future.

 - If mankind is to escape its programmed self-extinction the God who saves us will not descend from the machine: he will rise up again in the human soul.
 - By putting business before every other manifestation of life, our mechanical and financial civilization has forgotten the chief business of life: namely, growth, reproduction, development. It pays infinite attention to the incubator-and it forgets the egg!
 - Today, the notion of progress in a single line without goal or limit seems perhaps the most parochial notion of a very parochial century.
 - The final goal of human effort is man’s self-transforma tion.
 - As for the various kinds of montage photography, they are in reality not photography at all but a kind of painting in which photography is used – as pastiches of textiles are used in crazy-quilts – to form a mosaic. Whatever value the montage may have derives from painting rather than the camera.
 - Without leisure there can be neither art nor science nor fine conversation, nor any ceremonious performance of the offices of love and friendship.
 - If there are favourable habitats and favorable forms of association for animalsand plants, as ecology demonstrates, why not for men? If each particular natural environment has has its own balance; is there not perhaps an equivalent of this in culture?
