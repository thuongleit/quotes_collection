 - Never tell a child ‘you have a soul.’ Teach him, you are a soul; you have a body.

 - If God were not only to hear our prayers, as he does ever and always, but to answer them as we want them answered, he would not be God our Saviour but the ministering genius of our destruction.
 - Seeing is not believing – it is only seeing.
 - This is a wise, sane Christian faith: that a man commit himself, his life, and his hopes to God; that God undertakes the special protection of that man; that therefore that man ought not to be afraid of anything.
 - A man’s real belief is that which he lives by. What a man believes is the thing he does, not the thing he thinks.

 - And so all growth that is not towards God Is growing towards decay.
 - Free will is not the liberty to do whatever one likes, but the power of doing whatever one sees ought to be done, even in the very face of otherwise overwhelming impulse. There lies freedom, indeed.
 - Love loves unto purity. Love has ever in view the absolute loveliness of that which it beholds. Therefore all that is not beautiful in the beloved, all that comes between and is not of love’s kind, must be destroyed. And our God is a consuming fire.

 - Good souls many will one day be horrified at the things they now believe of God.
 - The miracles of Jesus were the ordinary works of his Father, wrought small and swift that we might take them in.
 - As in all sweetest music, a tinge of sadness was in every note. Nor do we know how much of the pleasures even of life we owe to the intermingled sorrows. Joy cannot unfold the deepest truths, although deepest truth must be deepest joy.

 - Nothing makes one feel so strong as a call for help.
 - Not even nothingness preceded life. Nothingness owes its very idea to existence.

 - One of the good things that come of a true marriage is, that there is one face on which changes come without your seeing them; or rather there is one face which you can still see the same, through all the shadows which years have gathered upon it.
 - This is and has been the Father’s work from the beginning-to bring us into the home of His heart.
 - All those evil doctrines about God that work misery and madness have their origin in the brains of the wise and prudent, not in the hearts of children.
 - Man finds it hard to get what he wants, because he does not want the best; God finds it hard to give, because He would give the best, and man will not take it.

 - Division has done more to hide Christ from the view of men than all the infidelity that has ever been spoken.
 - Fear is faithlessness.
 - I firmly believe people have hitherto been a great deal too much taken up about doctrine and far too little about practice. The word “doctrine,” as used in the Bible, means teaching of duty, not theory.
 - Forgiveness is the giving, and so the receiving, of life.
 - When I look like this into the blue sky, it seems so deep, so peaceful, so full of a mysterious tenderness, that I could lie for centuries and wait for the dawning of the face of God out of the awe-inspiring loving-kindness.
 - How strange this fear of death is! We are never frightened at a sunset.
 - In low theologies, hell is invariably the deepest truth, and the love of God is not so deep as hell.
 - The best thing you can do for your fellow, next to rousing his conscience, is – not to give him things to think about, but to wake things up that are in him; or say, to make him think things for himself.
 - In the midst of death we are in life. Life is the only reality; what men call death is but a shadow...
 - Oh, I believe that there is no away; that no love, no life, goes ever from us; it goes as He went, that it may come again, deeper and closer and surer, and be with us always, even to the end of the world.
 - We can walk without fear, full of hope and courage and strength to do His will, waiting for the endless good which He is always giving as fast as He can get us able to take it in.

 - Things come to the poor that can’t get in at the door of the rich. Their money somehow blocks it up. It is a great privilege to be poor – one that no man covets, and brat a very few have sought to retain, but one that yet many have learned to prize.
 - I repent me of the ignorance wherein I ever said that God made man out of nothing: there is no nothing out of which to make anything; God is all in all, and he made us out of himself.
 - We are all very anxious to be understood, and it is very hard not to be. But there is one thing much more necessary.? What is that, grandmother?? To understand other people.? Yes, grandmother. I must be fair – for if I’m not fair to other people, I’m not worth being understood myself. I see.

 - A man must learn to love his children, not because they are his, but because they are children, else his love will be scarcely a better thing at last than the party-spirit of the faithful politician.
 - In the hearts of witches, love and hate lie close together and often tumble over each other.

 - Forgiveness is the giving and so the receiving of life. the latter may be an impulse of a moment of heat; whereas the former is a cold and deliberate choice of the heart.
 - As cold as everything looks in winter, the sun has not forsaken us. He has only drawn away for a little, for good reasons, one of which is that we may learn that we cannot do without him.

 - As to the pure all things are pure, so the common mind sees far more vulgarity in others than the mind developed in genuine refinement.
 - I am sometimes almost terrified at the scope of the demands made upon me, at the perfection of the self-abandonment required of me; yet outside of such absoluteness can be no salvation.
 - People must not choose their neighbors; they must take the neighbors that God sends them. The neighbor is just the person who is next to you at the moment, the person with whom any business has brought you into contact.

 - Doubt may be a poor encouragement to do anything, but it is a bad reason for doing nothing.
 - A Baby Sermon- The lighting and thunder, they go and they come: But the stars and the stillness are always at home.

 - I rose as from the death that wipes out the sadness of life, and then dies itself in the new morrow.

 - What a man is lies as certainly upon his countenance as in his heart, though none of his acquaintances may be able to read it. The very intercourse with him may have rendered it more difficult.
 - I begin indeed to fear that I have undertaken an impossibility, undertaken to tell what I cannot tell because no speech at my command will fit the forms in my mind.
 - God hides nothing. His very work from the beginning is revelation – a casting aside of veil after veil, a showing unto men of truth after truth. On and on from fact Divine He advances, until at length in His Son Jesus He unveils His very face.

 - You can’t live on amusement. It is the froth on water – an inch deep and then the mud.
 - It may be an infinitely less evil to murder a man than to refuse to forgive him. The former may be the act of a moment of passion: the latter is the heart’s choice.

 - One chief cause of the amount of unbelief in the world is tha tthose who have seen something of the glory of Christ set themselves to theorize concerning him rather than to obey him.
