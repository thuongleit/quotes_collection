 - A missional church is a church that must live the dialectic. It must stay in the journey.
 - It’s not so much that the church has a mission, it’s that the mission of God has a church.
 - Real leaders ask hard questions and knock people out of their comfort zones and then manage the resulting distress.
 - Every Christian is a sent one. There is no such thing as an unsent Christian.
 - You can do more with 12 disciples than with 1,200 religious consumers.
 - There is no doubt that to walk with Jesus means to walk on the wilder side of life.
 - If we could be freed from our aversion to loss, our whole outlook on risk would change.
 - But herein lies the rub: Christianity has been on a long-term trend of decline in every Western cultural context that we can identify.
 - I found out the hard way that if we don’t disciple people, the culture sure will.
 - If a can opener no longer has the capacity to open cans, what is it?
 - The ultimate solution to the problem of spiritual complacency is to create a systematically embedded culture of holy urgency.
 - If we are going to make the change from community to communitas, and not just end up with an unsustainable adrenaline-junkie culture, we must have a sophisticated process to form people into adventurer-disciples.
 - Building community for its own sake is like attending a cancer support group without having cancer.
 - In missional churches, the baby birds have been pushed out of the nest and are learning to fly for themselves.
 - When there is no possibility of retreat, we will find the innovation that only the liminal situation can bring. In short, we find the faith of leap.
 - The church of Jesus needs to wake up from the exile of passivity and embrace liminality and adventure or continue to remain a religious ghetto for culturally co-opted, fearful, middle-class folk.
 - The missional church is not a new trend or the latest new technique for reaching postmodern people.
 - There’s no such thing as an unsent Christian. You have already been SENT.

 - This submission to the threshold of a cross is at the very root of our following Jesus; it changes the game completely.
 - The appetite for adventure and risk is not exclusive to young Christians. In face, it seems to be a fundamental yearning, knitted into the fabric of the human soul.
 - In order to develop a pioneering missional spirit, a capacity for genuine ecclesial innovation, let along engender daring discipleship, we are going to need the capacity to take a courageous stand when and where necessary.
 - Go among the people. Don’t assume you know what church looks like.
 - Nowadays we raise our children in a cocoon of domesticated security, far from any sense of risk or adventure.
 - Many church folk, in their self-conscious attempt to be overtly morally upright, emit all the wrong signals, thus messing with people’s perception of the gospel.
 - If we can embrace the adventure and risk and equip our churches to lay down their lives and abandon their inherent loss-aversion, who knows what innovation, what freshness, what new insights from the Spirit will emerge.
 - More data is not always the answer.
 - Heroes are important not only because they symbolize what we believe to be important, but because they also convey universal truths about personal self-discovery and self-transcendence, one’s role in society, and the relation between the two.

 - Those of us with too much invested in the way things are will never embrace the revolutionary cause required for wholesale change.
 - Worship that is in some way divorced from mission is counterfeit worship.

 - But the standard churchy spirituality doesn’t require any real action, courage, or sacrifice from its attendees.
 - It is vital to see ourselves as part of an ongoing journey started by our heroes in the Scriptures.
