 - Mars is there, waiting to be reached.
 - Mars has been flown by, orbited, smacked into, radar examined, and rocketed onto, as well as bounced upon, rolled over, shoveled, drilled into, baked and even blasted. Still to come: Mars being stepped on.
 - I still say, ‘Shoot for the moon; you might get there.’

 - We need to have people up there who can communicate what it feels like, not just pilots and engineers.
 - NASA needs to focus on the things that are really important and that we do not know how to do. The agency is a pioneering force, and that is where its competitive advantage lies.
 - There are a lot of reasons for not doing something. And if humanity had come up with all the reasons for not doing something we wouldn’t have spread across the Earth the way we have. There’s a curiosity, and I would submit that that curiosity will put human beings on the surface of Mars.
 - Let’s not spend resources that we don’t need to be sending astronauts back to the moon. Let’s not spend expensive resources on bringing people who have reached Mars back again. Prepare them to become a growing colony.
 - I don’t believe any pair of people had been more removed physically from the rest of the world than we were.

 - We could have human intelligence in orbit around Mars, building things there.
 - I shot down two airplanes in Korea, so I wasn’t a slouch.
 - What are you going to do with astronauts who first reach the surface of Mars and then turn around and rocket back home-ward? What are they going to do, write their memoirs? Would they go again? Having them repeat the voyage, in my view, is dim-witted. Why don’t they stay there on Mars?
 - With his deeds, not only words, President Obama has revitalized our struggling space program.
 - The big companies are the private industry. But they’re faced with a short-term need to show a profit in short-term.
 - There should be an international lunar base. That is certainly doable.
 - We need to begin thinking about building permanence on the Red Planet, not just have voyagers do some experiments, plant a flag and claim success. Having them go there, repeat this, in my view, is dim-witted. Why not stay there?
 - Space architectures capable of supporting a permanent human presence on Mars are extraordinarily complex, with many different interdependent systems.

 - The society of life on Mars, or the challenge of making Mars more livable, will have significant benefits on our attempts to modify and change in some ways the environment here on Earth.
 - There’s no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It’s no longer there. We’re descending rather rapidly.
 - I grew up in New Jersey and never went up the Statue of Liberty.
 - There are always door openings. And gradually, it accumulates. The opportunities open up in front of you.

 - Human rights problems will always exist for years to come, but maybe they’ll lessen somewhat.
 - I understand that Detroit was a pretty rough place to grow up in the ’70s and ’80s.
 - Retain the vision for space exploration. If we turn our backs on the vision again, we’re going to have to live in a secondary position in human space flight for the rest of the century.
 - Everyone should take their hats off to Neil Armstrong. He is a humble guy who doesn’t wave his own flag.
 - Returning to the Moon with NASA astronauts is not the best usage of our resources. Because OUR resources should be directed to outward, beyond-the-moon, to establishing habitation and laboratories on the surface of Mars that can be built, assembled, from the close-by moons of Mars.

 - Pascal Lee is a true pioneer of Mars exploration.
 - The feeling of reduced gravity and the limitations of the space suit resulted in a slow-motion movement. Perhaps not too far from a trampoline, but without the springiness and instability.
 - When I was a little kid, we only knew about our nine planets. Since then, we’ve downgraded Pluto but have discovered that other solar systems and stars are common. So life is probably quite prevalent.

 - Look at what Silicon Valley has done – the advance of computers.
 - To move forward, what’s required is a unified space agenda based on exploration, science, development, commerce, and security.
 - You need propellants to accelerate toward Mars, then to decelerate at Mars, again to re-accelerate from Mars to Earth, and finally to decelerate back at Earth. Accordingly, the mass of these required propellants, in short, drives our need for innovative launch vehicles.
 - I think the people who experienced the Apollo missions came away from that experience wondering to themselves, ‘When can we get a chance to experience spaceflight?’ I’ve heard that many, many times: that people got into a new career field hoping that they would be able to experience spaceflight.
 - I am definitely not rich.

 - Bravery comes along as a gradual accumulation of discipline.
 - I poured the wine into the chalice our church had given me. In the one-sixth gravity of the moon the wine curled slowly and gracefully up the side of the cup. It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.
 - If you want to say that the sky is black, and if I’m there, even if I fall back down again, I will be weightless for a period of time – maybe that’s the definition of space.
 - The view from space is like having a globe on your desk – it’s a broadening experience.
 - At the core of the risk-free society is a self-indulgent failure of nerve.

 - Mars could very well be a staging location for the resources of the asteroid belt. We have to learn how to get a payback somewhere, but it’s beyond Mars that the real payoff will come from minerals.
 - I don’t go through life verbalizing what I feel.
 - I have no doubt that humans will go to Mars. And I feel that America has led so many things in space – we have invested so much, and we have a lot to gain – that America could and should be the nation that should lead the settlement of Mars.
 - Astronauts are not superhuman. They lead ordinary lives and have varied personalities.
 - The way I see it, commercial interests should manage a lunar base while NASA gets on with the really important task of flying to Mars.
 - The government needs a role in carrying out exploration. They will be leading the development of the engines that are needed, and the private sector will take advantage of those.
 - When we can demonstrate that we can take off horizontally and put something into orbit, then we can begin to talk about increasing the amount of payload. But to say, ‘I’m going to do that and put people into orbit’ is a real leap.
 - As a student, I wrote English reports on science fiction.
 - The decision to go to the moon is now appreciated and associated with President Kennedy’s speech, but somebody else had told him it was a good idea. It turned out to be a good commitment, but it was a unique situation.
 - What comes after the moon? I think you can guess: Mars.
 - A mind concerned about danger is a clouded mind. It’s paralyzing.
 - Astronauts working for the government will always need to be either pilots or mission specialists. Those who want to be pilots should have military experience – ideally, a test pilot background.
 - There are a lot of people that get interested in something, and they hear about it, and they read about it, and then they watch it happen, and that’s why I had quite an interest in the lottery because you’d interest a lot of people, and then just a few would win a chance to do something.

 - I do celebrity ski races all over the world.
 - When we set out to land people on the surface of Mars, I think we should as a nation, as a world, commit ourselves to supporting a growing settlement and colonization there. To visit a few times and then withdraw would be an unforgivable waste of resources.
 - It’s not easy to get human beings into orbit. So far only three nations have been able to do that, with all the resources that they put together. And I’m just a little skeptical that that’s going to be done by the private sector without making use of what has been done by the government.
 - There is very little doubt, in my mind, that what the next monumental achievement of humanity will be the first landing by an Earthling, a human being, on the planet Mars.
