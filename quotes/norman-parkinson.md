 - A photographer without a magazine behind him is like a farmer without fields.
 - I like there to be a joke in practically every photo I take. Nobody has the right to make photography boring.

 - The camera can be the most deadly weapon since the assassin’s bullet. Or it can be the lotion of the heart.
 - I could never bear to be buried with people to whom I had not been introduced.
