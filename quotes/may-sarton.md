 - A body without bones would be a limp impossible mess, so a day without steady routine would be disruptive and chaotic.
 - It’s extraordinary how little two people can understand each other and how cruel two people who are fond of each other can be to each other – there is practically no cruelty so awful because their power to hurt is so great.

 - Flowers and plants are silent presences. They nourish every sense except the ear.
 - In the middle of the night, things well up from the past that are not always cause for rejoicing – the unsolved, the painful encounters, the mistakes, the reasons for shame or woe. But all, good or bad, give me food for thought, food to grow on.
 - It is good for a professional to be reminded that his professionalism is only a husk, that the real person must remain an amateur, a lover of the work.

 - One thing is certain, and I have always known it – the joys of my life have nothing to do with age. They do not change. Flowers, the morning and evening light, music, poetry, silence, the goldfinches darting about.
 - The more our bodies fail us, the more naked and more demanding is the spirit, the more open and loving we can become if we are not afraid of what we are and of what we feel. I am not a phoenix yet, but here among the ashes, it may be that the pain is chiefly that of new wings trying to push through.

 - Old age is not an illness, it is a timeless ascent. As power diminishes, we grow toward the light.
 - The garden is growth and change and that means loss as well as constant new treasures to make up for a few disasters.
 - It is a waste of time to see people who have only a social surface to show. I will make every effort to find out the real person, but if I can’t, then I am upset and cross. Time wasted is poison.
 - What is there to do when people die – people so dear and rare – but bring them back by remembering?
 - It is dark now. The snow is deep blue and the ocean nearly black. It is time for some music.
 - I would like to believe when I die that I have given myself away like a tree that sows seed every spring and never counts the loss, because it is not loss, it is adding to future life. It is the tree’s way of being. Strongly rooted perhaps, but spilling out its treasure on the wind.
 - What is destructive is impatience, haste, expecting too much too fast.
 - It is only when we can believe that we are creating the soul that life has any meaning, but when we can believe it – and I do and always have – then there is nothing we do that is without meaning and nothing that we suffer that does not hold the seed of creation in it.
 - We have to make myths of our lives, the point being that if we do, then every grief or inexplicable seizure by weather, woe, or work can-if we discipline ourselves and think hard enough-be turned to account, be made to yield further insight into what it is to be alive, to be a human being.
 - Family life! The United Nations is child’s play compared to the tugs and splits and need to understand and forgive in any family.
 - I long for the bulbs to arrive, for the early autumn chores are melancholy, but the planting of bulbs is the work of hope and is always thrilling.
 - She became for me an island of light, fun, wisdom where I could run with my discoveries and torments and hopes at any time of day and find welcome.
 - There is a proper balance between not asking enough of oneself and asking or expecting too much.
 - The poet must be free to love or hate as the spirit moves him, free to change, free to be a chameleon, free to be an enfant terrible. He must above all never worry about this effect on other people.

 - I sometimes think men don’t ‘hear’ very well, if I take your meaning to be ‘understand what is going on in a person.’ That’s what makes them so restful. Women wear each other out with their everlasting touching of the nerve.

 - There is a wilder solitude in winter When every sense is pricked alive and keen.
 - Nobody stays special when they’re old, Anna. That’s what we have to learn.

 - Innocence is not pure so much as pleased, Always expectant, bright-eyed, self-enclosed.

 - We are able to laugh when we achieve detachment, if only for a moment.
