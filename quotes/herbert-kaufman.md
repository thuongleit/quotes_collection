 - Failure is only postponed success as long as courage ‘coaches’ ambition. The habit of persistence is the habit of victory.
 - Only things the dreamers make live on. They are the eternal conquerors.

 - Makers of empire, they have fought for bigger things than crowns and higher seats than thrones.
 - Rich men’s sons are seldom rich men’s fathers.
