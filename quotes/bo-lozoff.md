 - Life, like any other exciting story, is bound to have painful and scary parts, boring and depressing parts, but it’s a brilliant story, and it’s up to us how it will turn out in the end.
 - Little by little deep inside us, the diamond shines, the eyes open, the dawn rises, we become what we already are.
 - The gap between our sincere values and our actual behavior is the source of all self-hatred.
 - We’re all stumbling towards the light with varying degrees of grace at any given moment.
 - The cause of all our personal problems and nearly all the problems of the world can be summed up in a single sentence: Human life is very deep, and our modern dominant lifestyle is not.
 - Like a child standing in a beautiful park with his eyes shut tight, there’s no need to imagine trees, flowers, deer, birds, and sky; we merely need to open our eyes and realize what is already here, who we already are – as soon as we stop pretending we’re small or unholy.
 - Meditation is simply seeing reality and acknowledging it with bare honesty.
