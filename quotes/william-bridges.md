 - Change comes more from managing the journey than from announcing the destination.
 - Change is an event but a transition is the process that you go through in response to the change.
 - All transitions are composed of an ending, a neutral zone and a new beginning.
 - It is when we are in transition that we are most completely alive.
 - Before people can begin something new, they have to end what used to be and unlearn the old way.
 - It isn’t the changes that do you in, it’s the transitions.
 - We resist transition not because we can’t accept the change, but because we can’t accept letting go of that piece of ourselves that we have to give up when and because the situation has changed.
 - Nothing so undermines organizational change as the failure to think through the losses people face.
 - Much as we may wish to make a new beginning, some part of us resists doing so as though we were making the first step toward disaster.
 - Faith is the soul’s adventure.
