 - I’ve always believed that happiness is just around the corner. The trick is fining the right corner.
 - Haydn, Beethoven, Mozart, none of them were born in Vienna. They all moved there. It became a magnet, but what made it magnetized in the first place? There has to be a seed there. In the case of Vienna of about 1780, it was this deep-seated love of music.
 - Perhaps it’s true you can’t go back in time, but you can return to the scene of a love, of a crime, of happiness, and of a fateful decision; the places are what remain, are what you can possess, are what is immortal.

 - Psychologists call it “defocused attention,” where you broaden your horizons, let your mind float and drift a bit. Coffee keeps us sharp and alert. It’s great if you’re driving at 3 o’clock in the morning. It’s not so great if you’re trying to come up with the next violin concerto.
 - Someone like Mozart moves from Salzburg to Vienna, where all of the sudden he finds this musical city that is not only asking for music, it’s demanding music of him.
 - You look around the world at geniuses, and they don’t appear randomly, they appear in genius clusters. Athens in 50 BC, Florence 1500, Silicon Valley today. This is not a coincidence.
 - It’s not what we believe that makes us happy but the act of believing. In anything.

 - When you’re stuck on something creatively, you can’t solve a problem, you go to a coffee shop.
 - Our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors and the woman you hardly notice who cleans your office. Happiness is not a noun or verb. It’s a conjunction. Connective tissue.
 - I’m interested in genius the way a hungry man is interested in Philadelphia cheesesteaks. I want something. I want a piece of it.
 - We help other people because we can, or because it makes us feel good, not because we’re counting on some future payback. There is a word for this; love.
 - I would love to think there is a direct relationship between coffee and genius, but they’ve done studies, and if anything, caffeine probably makes you a little less creative.
 - A mystery is not a puzzle waiting to be solved, but rather something for which there is no human solution. Mystery’s offspring is not frustration but awe, and that sense of awe grows in tandem with knowledge.
 - We are shaped not only by our current geography but by our ancestral one as well. Americans, for instance, retain a frontier spirit even though the only frontier that remains is that vast open space between the SUV and strip mall. We are our past.
 - You need some reason why Beethoven, Mozart and Haydn in the 18th century all flocked to Vienna. What was it about Vienna? They must have known on some level that that is where they would flourish. It’s what biologists call “selective migration.”
