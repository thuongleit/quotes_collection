 - This is Life, not Heaven you don’t have to be perfect.
 - Tell yourself whatever you need to hear, you’re the only one listening.
 - I think God has a plan for me, but I don’t think it’s in this life.
 - Fashion is not art. Fashion isnt even culture. Fashion is advertising, and advertising is money. And for every dollar you earn, someone has to pay.
 - You know what I think? I think there’s a reason for everything. And I think that there’s a plan for everyone. And I think that God has a big plan for me. Just not in this life.
