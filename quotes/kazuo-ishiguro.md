 - We took away your art because we thought it would reveal your souls. Or to put it more finely, we did it to prove you had souls at all.
 - Memories, even your most precious ones, fade surprisingly quickly. But I don’t go along with that. The memories I value most, I don’t ever see them fading.
 - Love isn’t about when you first meet. It’s about the many, many years you spend together, when you’re trying to keep that flame burning.
 - I keep thinking about this river somewhere, with the water moving really fast. And these two people in the water, trying to hold onto each other, holding on as hard as they can, but in the end it’s just too much. The current’s too strong. They’ve got to let go, drift apart.
 - What is pertinent is the calmness of beauty, its sense of restraint. It is as though the land knows of its own beauty, its own greatness, and feels no need to shout it.
 - We all live inside bodies that will deteriorate. But when you look at human beings, they’re capable of very decent things: love, loyalty. When time is running out, they don’t care about possessions or status. They want to put things right if they’ve done wrong.
 - Don’t you wonder sometimes, what might have happened if you tried?
 - What I’m not sure about, is if our lives have been so different from the lives of the people we save. We all complete. Maybe none of us really understand what we’ve lived through, or feel we’ve had enough time.
 - It was like when you make a move in chess and just as you take your finger off the piece, you see the mistake you’ve made, and there’s this panic because you don’t know yet the scale of disaster you’ve left yourself open to.
 - The evening’s the best part of the day. You’ve done your day’s work. Now you can put your feet up and enjoy it.
 - It had never occurred to me that our lives, which had been so closely interwoven, could unravel with such speed.
 - I like the fact that by mimicking the way memory works, a writer can actually write in a fluid way – one solid scene doesn’t have to fall on another solid scene, you can just have a fragment that then dovetails into another one that took place 30 years apart from it.
 - Indeed – why should I not admit it? – in that moment, my heart was breaking.
 - You say you’re sure? Sure that you’re in love? How can you know it? You think love is so simple?

 - Your life must now run the course that’s been set for it.

 - And if these incidents now seem full of significance and all of a piece, it’s probably because I’m looking at them in the light of what came later...
 - I’m interested in memory because it’s a filter through which we see our lives, and because it’s foggy and obscure, the opportunities for self-deception are there. In the end, as a writer, I’m more interested in what people tell themselves happened rather than what actually happened.
 - Every country should have a strong literary tradition of its own at the center, but it should also have an interest in other countries.

 - Sometimes I get so immersed in my own company, if I unexpectedly run into someone I know, it’s a bit of a shock and takes me a while to adjust.
 - Perhaps it is indeed time I began to look at this whole matter of bantering more enthusiastically. After all, when one thinks about it, it is not such a foolish thing to indulge in – particularly if it is the case that in bantering lies the key to human warmth.
 - All you decent, well-meaning gentlemen, let me ask you, have you any idea what sort of place the world is becoming all around you? The days when you could act out of your noble instincts are over. Except of course, you here in Europe don’t yet seem to know it.
 - I discovered that my imagination came alive when I moved away from the immediate world around me.
 - You’re always in a rush, or else you’re too exhausted to have a proper conversation. Soon enough, the long hours, the traveling, the broken sleep have all crept into your being and become part of you, so everyone can see it, in your posture, your gaze, the way you move and talk.

 - One is not struck by the truth until prompted quite accidentally by some external event.
 - And I’m a Hailsham student – which is enough by itself sometimes to get people’s backs up.
 - There’s a practical problem about time and energy, and a more subtle problem of what it does to a writer’s head, to continually analyze why they write, where it all comes from, where it’s going to.
 - I think it’s quite difficult to understand what kind of life a writer leads. They might be millionaires, or they might be starving people.
 - Perhaps one day, all these conflicts will end, and it won’t be because of great statesmen or churches or organisations like this one. It’ll be because people have changed. They’ll be like you, Puffin. More a mixture. So why not become a mongrel? It’s healthy.

 - She might be a great person, but life’s so much bigger than just loving someone.
 - Memory is quite central for me. Part of it is that I like the actual texture of writing through memory.

 - Even at the time, I realised this couldn’t be right, that this interpretation didn’t fit with the rest of the lyrics. But that wasn’t an issue with me. The song was about what I said, and I used to listen to it again and again, on my own, whenever I got the chance.
 - There comes a point when you can more or less count the number of books you’re going to write before you die.
 - There are things I am more interested in than the clone thing. How are they trying to find their place in the world and make sense of their lives? To what extent can they transcend their fate? As time starts to run out, what are the things that really matter?
 - Everything might scatter. You might be right. I suppose it’s something we can’t easily get away from. People need to feel they belong. To a nation, to a race. Otherwise, who knows what might happen? This civilisation of ours, perhaps it’ll just collapse. And everything scatter, as you put it.
 - Memory, I realize, can be an unreliable thing; often it is heavily coloured by the circumstances in which one remembers.

 - If you were a boy and a girl and you were in love with each other, really, properly in love, and if you could show it, then the people who run Hailsham, they sorted it out for you. They sorted it out so you could have a few years together before you began your donations.
