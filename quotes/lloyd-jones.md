 - Men who try to do something and fail are infinitely better than those who try to do nothing and succeed.
 - You cannot pretend to read a book. Your eyes will give you away. So will your breathing. A person entranced by a book simply forgets to breathe. The house can catch alight and a reader deep in a book will not look up until the wallpaper is in flames.
 - Dreams are nervy things â€“ all it takes is for one stern word to be spoken in their direction and they shrivel up and die.
 - I do not know what you are supposed to do with memories likes these. It feels wrong to want to forget. Perhaps this is why we write these things down, so we can move on.
