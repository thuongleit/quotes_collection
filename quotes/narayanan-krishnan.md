 - Everybody has got 5.5 liters of blood. I am just a human being. For me everybody the same. There are thousands and thousands of people suffering. What is the ultimate purpose of life? It’s to give. Start giving. See the joy of giving.
 - I want to save my people. That is the purpose of my life.
 - What is the ultimate purpose of life? It’s to give.
