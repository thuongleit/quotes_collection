 - Just play every hand, you canâ€™t miss them all.
 - The one who bets the most wins. Cards just break ties.
 - You can bluff the good players, but not the bad players. Against the bad players, you have to have a hand.
 - For five days, I had no sleep. None. I did not sleep. And the last day, the reason I lasted, I drank 20 Red Bulls, about 20 cups of coffee. I could not function.
