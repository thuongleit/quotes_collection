 - Time is priceless, yet it costs us nothing. You can do anything you want with it, but you can’t own it. You can spend it, but you can’t keep it. And once you’ve lost it, there is no getting it back. It’s just gone.
 - Don’t ever second-guess a strong feeling that you have. Trust your gut.
 - If you let people break your spirit and detour you from your path, then you have not been true to yourself or those you’re here to touch, those who believe in you.
 - Figuring out our gifts in life is part of our journey to becoming enlightened human beings.
