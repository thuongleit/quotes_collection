 - Expect the unexpected.
 - Don’t talk too much or too soon.
 - When you make a mistake, there are only three things you should ever do about it: 1. Admit it. 2. Learn from it, and 3. Don’t repeat it.
 - It’s not the will to win that matters-everyone has that. It’s the will to prepare to win that matters.
 - Don’t tolerate lazy people. They are losers.
 - Show class, have pride, and display character. If you do, winning takes care of itself.
 - There’s a lot of blood, sweat, and guts between dreams and success.
 - Have a plan. Follow the plan, and you’ll be surprised how successful you can be. Most people don’t have a plan. That’s why it’s easy to beat most folks.
 - I’m no miracle man. I guarantee nothing but hard work.
 - If you believe in yourself and have dedication and pride – and never quit, you’ll be a winner. The price of victory is high but so are the rewards.
 - Little things make the difference. Everyone is well prepared in the big things, but only the winners perfect the little things.
 - Be aware of “yes” men. Generally, they are losers. Surround yourself with winners. Never forget – people win.
 - Don’t worry about making friends; don’t worry about making enemies. Worry about winning, because if you win, your enemies can’t hurt you, and if you lose, your friends can’t stand you.

 - You win games with your strengths, not your weaknesses.
 - If you want to walk the heavenly streets of gold, you gotta know the password, “Roll, Tide, Roll!”
 - You never know how a horse will pull until you hook him to a heavy load.
 - People who are in it for their own good are individualists. They don’t share the same heartbeat that makes a team so great. A great unit, whether it be football or any organization, shares the same heartbeat.
 - Set goals – high goals for you and your organization. When your organization has a goal to shoot for, you create teamwork, people working for a common good.
 - If anything goes bad, I did it. If anything goes semi-good, we did it. If anything goes real good, then you did it. That’s all it takes to get people to win football games for you.
 - Football changes and so do people.
 - No coach has ever won a game by what he knows; it’s what his players know that counts.

 - It’s kind of hard to rally around a math class.
 - Hell, no! A tie is like kissing your sister!
 - Get the winners into the game.
 - If a man is a quitter, I’d rather find out in practice than in a game. I ask for all a player has so I’ll know later what I can expect.
 - Most coaches study the films when they lose. I study them when we win -to see if I can figure out what I did right.
 - Never quit. It is the easiest cop-out in the world. Set a goal and don’t quit until you attain it. When you do attain it, set another goal, and don’t quit until you reach it. Never quit.

 - A good, quick, small team can beat a big, slow team any time.
 - A champion pays an extra price to be better than anyone else.
 - Sure, I’d love to beat Notre Dame, don’t get me wrong. But nothing matters more than beating that cow college on the other side of the state!
 - One man doesn’t make a team. It takes eleven.
 - Here’s a twenty, bury two.
 - I’ve made so many mistakes that if I don’t make the same mistakes over, we’re going to come pretty close to winning.
 - But it’s still a coach’s game. Make no mistake. You start at the top. If you don’t have a good one at the top, you don’t have a cut dog’s chance. If you do, the rest falls into place. You have to have good assistants, and a lot of things, but first you have to have the chairman of the board.
 - Don’t overwork your squad. If you’re going to make a mistake, under-work them.

 - There is no sin in not liking to play; it’s a mistake for a boy to be there if he doesn’t want to.
 - The biggest mistake coaches make is taking borderline cases and trying to save them. I’m not talking about grades now, I’m talking about character. I want to know before a boy enrolls about his home life, and what his parents want him to be.
 - Don’t talk too much. Don’t pop off. Don’t talk after the game until you cool off.
 - Recruiting is the one thing I hate. I won’t do it unless my coaches tell me I’ve just got to. The whole process is kind of undignified for me and the young man.
 - At Alabama, our players don’t win Heisman Trophies. Our teams win National Championships.
 - I’m known as a recruiter. Well you’ve got to have chicken to make chicken salad.
 - Being inside Tiger Stadium is like being on the inside of a drum.
 - First there are those who are winners, and know they are winners. Then there are the losers who know they are losers. Then there are those who are not winners, but don’t know it. They’re the ones for me. They never quit trying. They’re the soul of our game.
 - When you play defense you have to storm the fort or play cover – you can’t do both.

 - In life, you’ll have your back up against the wall many times. You might as well get used to it.

 - I think the most important thing of all for any team is a winning attitude. The coaches must have it. The players must have it. The student body must have it. If you have dedicated players who believe in themselves, you don’t need a lot of talent.
 - I didn’t care if we ever quit practicing. I loved it. The only other guy I ever knew who loved it as much was Jerry Duncan. He would beg to practice even when he was hurt. I’ve actually seen him cry because the trainer told him he couldn’t scrimmage.
 - The idea of molding men means a lot to me.
 - There’s no use fussing on a boy who doesn’t have any ability.
 - If wanting to win is a fault, as some of my critics seem to insist, then I plead guilty. I like to win. I know no other way. It’s in my blood.

 - The faint old man shall lean his silver head To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep, And dry the moistened curls that overspread His temples, while his breathing grows more deep.

 - Football games are generally won by the boys with the greatest desire.
 - You have to learn what makes this or that Sammy run. For one it’s a pat on the back, for another it’s eating him out, for still another it’s a fatherly talk, or something else. You’re a fool if you think as I did as a young coach, that you can treat them all alike.
 - If it is worth playing, it is worth paying the price to win.
