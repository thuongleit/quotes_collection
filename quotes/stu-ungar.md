 - Fold and live to fold again.
 - There’s no one that ever beat me playing cards, the only one that ever beat me was myself.
 - When the cards are dealt, I just want to destroy people.
 - I never want to be called a ‘good loser.’ Show me a good loser and I’ll just show you a loser.
 - Some day, I suppose it’s possible for someone to be a better No Limit Hold’em player than me. I doubt it, but it could happen. But, I swear to you, I don’t see how anyone could ever play gin better than me.
