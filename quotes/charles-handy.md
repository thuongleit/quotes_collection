 - Citizenship is the chance to make a difference to the place where you belong.
 - Change is only another word for growth, another synonym for learning.
 - A good team is a great place to be, exciting, stimulating, supportive, successful. A bad team is horrible, a sort of human prison.
 - Instead of a national curriculum for education, what is really needed is an individual curriculum for every child.
 - The future is not inevitable. We can influence it, if we know what we want it to be.
 - Creativity is born of chaos, even if it is somewhat difficult to glimpse the possibilities in the midst of the confusion.
 - We cannot wait for great visions from great people, for they are in short supply. It is up to us to light our own small fires in the darkness.
 - We learn by reflecting on what has happened. The process seldom works in reverse, although most educational processes assume that it does. We hope that we can teach people how to live before they live, or how to manage before they manage.

 - Creativity needs a bit of untidiness. Make everything too neat and there is no room for experiment.
 - Villages are small and personal, and their inhabitants have names, characters, and personalities. What more appropriate concept on which to base our institutions of the future than the ancient social unit whose flexibility and strength substained human society through millenia?
