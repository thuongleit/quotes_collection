 - So always keep momentum, it’s this prime directive for managing a startup.
 - You want to sound crazy, but you want to actually be right.

 - In general, it’s best if you’re building something that you yourself need.

 - For most of the early hires you make in a startup, experience doesn’t matter very much, and you should go for aptitude.
 - If someone is difficult to talk to, if someone cannot communicate clearly, it’s a real problem in terms of their likelihood to work out.
 - Founders are usually very stingy with equity to employees and very generous with equity to investors. I think this is totally backwards.
 - You can have a startup and one other thing, you can have a family, but you probably can’t have many other hobbies.

 - Keep salaries low and equity high. Keep the organization as flat as you can.
 - Obsess about the quality of the product.
 - The role of the board is advice and consent. If the CEO does not lay out a clear strategy and tries to get the board to set one, it will usually end in disaster.
