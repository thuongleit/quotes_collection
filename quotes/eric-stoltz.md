 - I was up for Michael Corleone in ‘The Godfather,’ but, as I was only 10 at the time, I think Mr. Coppola made the right choice. The Julia Roberts role in ‘Pretty Woman’ held a bizarre allure for me. But, it’s silly to look back with regret.
 - It’s hard not to get a big head in the film industry, there are people on a set paid to cater to your every need, from the minute you arrive until you go home. It’s kind of strange, but not unpleasant.

 - When you’re in a movie, they treat you like you’re four years old and give you whatever you want. On some level it’s really wonderful and gratifying, but on another level it’s rather disturbing. I’m sure you’ve spoken to movie stars and wondered: How do these people survive without babysitters?

 - I think I’m wealthy. I make a good living for what I do. Well, it depends. If I’m doing an independent film I’m making no money – probably losing money. But if I’m doing a studio film, I’ll make a decent wage. I can live for a year without working.

 - I can count on one hand the directors who actually directed me.

 - I’ve been pretty lucky – or slothful – in that I’ve never been a ‘career builder.’ I take the jobs that come along that feel right, and that’s left me fairly open to all genres, really. But with ‘Caprica,’ the complex, dark and very smart script was the draw.
