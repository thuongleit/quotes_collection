 - What is a Communist? One who hath yearnings For equal division of unequal earnings, Idler or bungler, or both, he is willing, To fork out his copper and pocket your shilling.
 - Stern fate and time Will have their victims; and the best die first, Leaving the bad still strong, though past their prime, To curse the hopeless world they ever curs’d Vaunting vile deeds, and vainest of the worst.
 - The quivering flesh, though torture-torn, may live, but souls, once deeply wounded, heal no more.
 - Daisies infinite Uplift in praise their little growing hands, O’er every hill that under heaven expands.
 - Tis toil’s reward, that sweetens industry, As love inspires with strength the enraptur’d thrush.
 - Sleep, to the homeless thou art home; the friendless find in thee a friend.
 - If’t were not for my cat and dog, I think I could not live.
 - The streams, rejoiced that winter’s work is done, Talk of to-morrow’s cowslips as they run.
 - Things of today? Deeds which are harvest for Eternity!
 - Again the violet of our early days Drinks beauteous azure from the golden sun, And kindles into fragrance at his blaze.
