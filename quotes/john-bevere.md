 - The greater hardship you endure, the greater the authority God entrusts to you.
 - Do not be afraid to allow the Holy Spirit to reveal any unforgiveness or bitterness. The longer you hide it, the stronger it will become and the harder your heart will grow. Stay tenderhearted.
 - I say that trials and tests locate a person. In other words they determine where you are spiritually. They reveal the true condition of your heart. How you react under pressure is how the real you reacts.
 - This truth remains: Only those you care about can hurt you. You expect more from them-after all, you’ve given more of yourself to them. The higher the expectations, the greater the fall.
