 - Life is great, football is better.
 - My dad has a great expression. He always says, ‘Tell me a fact and I’ll learn, tell me the truth and I believe, but tell me a story, and it will live in my heart forever.’ Interestingly enough now, my dad’s story is going to be in Canton and hopefully that will live forever, too.
 - My father always used to say ‘treat everyone as a gentleman; not because they are, but because you are.’

 - I’ve always believed in making films that you make the little decisions with your head, but you make the big decisions with your heart.
 - If you can show something as complicated as two people falling in love with just music and camera angles, well, just think about what you can do with football.
 - I think in the NFL knowledge is power, and you try to get the knowledge by whatever means.

 - If there’s one thing I can’t stand, it’s not being noticed.
 - There have been nine Super Bowls in New Orleans, and not all of them have brought the best of luck to NFL Films. We got robbed twice there, got food poisoning, and my hotel room was broken into on the day the Bears played the Patriots in January 1986.
 - Football is a sport of emotions, and we have to capture that in our films.
 - You know how I came up with the name ‘Road to the Super Bowl?’ It’s an homage to the old Bob Hope – Bing Crosby buddy movies – you know, like ‘Road to Zanzibar’ or ‘Road to Morocco.’ Can you tell? All I’ve done my whole life is go to movies.
 - Lombardi, a certain magic still lingers in the very name. It speaks of duels in the snow and November mud He remains for many the heart of pro football, pumping hard right now.

 - I was kicked out of school one year for streaking.
 - A perfect record does not mean that someone is the greatest. Rocky Marciano never lost a fight, but I never hear anyone say he’s the greatest heavyweight champion of all time.
