 - What distinguishes a mathematical model from, say, a poem, a song, a portrait or any other kind of “model,” is that the mathematical model is an image or picture of reality painted with logical symbols instead of with words, sounds or watercolors.
 - The global financial system consists of firms in the financial services sector – banks, hedge funds, insurance companies and the like – and various governmental agencies who are charged with regulating these firms.
 - I believe is that we can forecast the “changing landscape of context,” and thus get insight into when we are entering the danger zone of an X-event.
 - Reality is a wave function traveling both backward and forward in time.
 - My own guess is that quite quickly the machine intelligence will start dreaming machine dreams and thinking machine thoughts, both of which would totally incomprehensible to us. This would then lead to each species, we and the machines, moving off on to its own separate life trajectory.
 - The unfolding time for the end of globalization or a worldwide deflation is much longer, certainly measured in years, if not decades.
 - Trying to solve the problem by creating more debt is analogous to trying to stop being an alcoholic by going on a bender down at the corner bar.
 - The process of globalization has now interconnected almost everything ranging from financial markets to transport networks to communication systems in a huge system that no one really understands.
 - At some point, the world is going to have to bite the bullet and accept a huge downsizing in its way of life to bring the assets-to-debt ratio back in touch with reality.
 - In fact, the very nature of an X-event is that it is both rare and surprising. So I would not say that any specific X-event is likely. What I would say, though, is that some X-event is not only plausible, but very likely in a time scale of a few years.
 - Once the reality sets in of a superhuman intelligence being in control of every aspect of the infrastructures we rely upon for everyday life, we will simply have to try to come to an accommodation with that entity.
 - When the next big problem comes online, be it the Euro crisis, nuclear proliferation, an overstretched Internet, a killer flu, or any of the other possibilities I consider in X-Events, we will suffer a complexity overload.
 - I think that in the immediate aftermath of a superhuman machine intelligence revealing itself, most people would feel very threatened but take solace in the thought that we can always pull the plug.
 - To function effectively, the system scientist must know a considerable amount about the natural world AND about mathematics, without being an expert in either field. This is clearly a prescription for career disaster in today’s world of ultra-high specialization.
 - I don’t think the emergence of a superhuman intelligence would be at all catastrophic but much more likely to be beneficial – just as long as we don’t start trying to interfere with it!
 - The world is awash in more debt than there is money enough in the world to liquidate it.
 - If the group has a negative social mood, believing that tomorrow will be worse than today, the bias goes in the opposite direction. Instead of “welcoming” we have “rejecting,” instead of “global” we tend to see events that are “local” and so forth.
 - If you ask which of the scenarios I think is most dangerous, though, I will give a different answer. In that form of the question, I regard a nuclear attack, terrorist-generated or otherwise, as the most threatening combination of likelihood and long-term damage to modern life today.
 - I do not believe that there is any person, method, or tool that can consistently and reliably predict specific human events, X- or otherwise.
 - System theorists know that it’s easy to couple simple-to-understand systems into a “super system” that’s capable of displaying behavioral modes that cannot be seen in any of its constituent parts. This is the process called “emergence.”
