 - A person riding a unicycle on a tightrope doesn’t worry about being likeable; they’re doing something amazing that very few people can do.
 - Sometimes it’s fun to explore ideas that might make people uncomfortable. If you let it, there’s a lot of self-censoring that can go on in the name of remaining likeable, but I don’t find that an artistically interesting path to take.
 - Comedy takes all of life and puts it through a lens of acceptance, just by the mere act of talking about it on stage in a communal setting. It’s very primal and ritualistic in that sense.
 - Hard work is a muscle that you develop, as is taking risks.
 - With a project like Teachers Lounge, you’re wearing a lot of hats, so it demands hard work and focus if you want to do it right.
 - Comedy clubs are arguably one of the last bastions of uncensored, public free speech.
 - Teachers Lounge is a web series I co-created with Hollis James. We intentionally left the apostrophe out to turn Lounge into a verb. The show is about teachers lounging around, wasting time.

 - I’m keeping in shape, you know, gotta look good for the ladies – and certain guys. Hey, I can’t control who’s looking. I just gotta bring the heat.
 - A crowd is the only way to know if something works. Telling a friend or two doesn’t matter. A crowd is what tells you what works or doesn’t, so I’d rather go in front of them cold and see.
 - Not that that’s the goal, but sometimes these funny insights can also be deeply profound.

 - After twenty plus years of performing hundreds of shows a year, I prefer to try things out on stage rather than for friends. I don’t see the benefit in that, really.
 - TV is a different animal. It’s not a club set. As you said, you do short sets on TV – about five minutes. So you have to get that rhythm down and also be aware of the camera so you’re connecting with the viewers at home as well as the studio audience. It’s a different muscle to develop.
 - Inherent in mourning is celebration. Mourning without celebration or some form of acceptance leaves you stuck.
