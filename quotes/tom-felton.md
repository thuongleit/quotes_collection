 - Everyone plays their own crucial part towards the film.
 - Bad boys do get the girls.
 - I would miss months of school and then return with bright blond hair. Needless to say, there was bullying. I wasn’t beaten up daily, but there was name-calling and jealousy. You have to bear in mind that ‘Harry Potter’ wasn’t cool. I wasn’t part of the ‘Terminator’ franchise.
 - I’m a real big country boy.

 - I like my ladies lady-ish, feminine so to speak. I love jeans and hoodies, but the idea of being an ultimate tomboy does slightly confuse me.

 - I used to have all the Goosebumps books as a kid too.
 - And to me, fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It’s fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you, but it’s not real. And it’s totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.
 - The best-looking girls don’t do anything, they just sort of know they’re beautiful, especially in jeans and a hoodie.
