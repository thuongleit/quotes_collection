 - We’re looking at Earth science, observing our planet. Also space science, looking at the ozone in the atmosphere around our Earth. Also looking at life science. And on a human level, using ourselves as test subjects.
 - I’ve always enjoyed traveling and having experience with different cultures and different people. But it’s also a wonderful thing to be able to benefit and enable research, not only in our country but around the world.
 - Science, for hundreds of years, has spanned the differences between cultures and between countries.

 - Certainly my parents were a huge influence. They always expected the most out of all of us. And expected us to do our very best. I’m thankful to them for allowing me to do what I wanted to do.
 - There are some very significant changes in the way the fluids are distributed in our body, the way our heart functions initially, and as well as our bone and muscle.
 - Gravity is one variable in a lot of scientific processes. If you can remove gravity or minimize its effect, then you can understand the other processes that are going on.
 - The microgravity or the very, very low amount of gravity that we have up in space forces some changes in different processes. It forces changes in us as human beings.
 - There’s a lot of different things that we do during life that could personally harm us and I choose not to stop doing those things.
 - We’ve had such thorough training, we’ve had an excellent team on the ground. With the minor glitches that have occurred, we’ve been able to take care of them. And the teams on the ground are getting tons of incredible data.
 - Gravity pulls our bodily fluids down, like water in a glass goes to the bottom part of a glass. In space, the water doesn’t stay in the bottom of the glass. It distributes itself evenly over time throughout the entire volume of the glass.
 - As a physician, I understand how important it is to collect data on people so we can understand what’s happening with them. I will be in the position to help enable that knowledge.
 - This has been a great experience for me. The first couple of days you don’t always feel too well. You adjust to the fluid shifting, how to fly through space without hitting things or anybody else. But then you get in a groove.
 - Everyone that I’ve talked to who’s been to space has thoroughly enjoyed the experience, and what you often hear them say is: It was great, but we just had to come home.
 - Things are going very smoothly. As expected, there are some minor glitches, and the eight minutes that it took us to get to orbit, we trained months and months for, and didn’t have to use any of that preparation, other than being aware and ready.
 - The Navy’s paid for you to go through school, and then they need doctors to go out and take care of people who are in various different parts of the world. I decided to pay back my time first as an undersea medical officer. I was stationed in Scotland.

 - I can’t think of anything specific growing up that pointed me toward NASA at all. I was interested in the Moon landings just about the same as everyone else of my generation. But I never really thought about being an astronaut or working in space myself.
 - Some things are only capable of being done in space. Examples of that are looking at our Earth from that far away, and understanding the entire processes of storms and weather patterns, and oceans, and coastlines.
 - Life science research can be done on multiple platforms. Since we have a very small number of people flying into space, the more people you have, the better.
