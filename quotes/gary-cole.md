 - You make the choice. You look at each scene and you make sure that this is not a person deceiving people.
 - A show that’s been successful that been on a while, chances are it’s going to stay that way. At least it’s going to maintain some kind of standard. But when a show begins, there’s no telling. Even after 13 shows or a whole year, you don’t know what will become of it.
