 - Never regret yesterday. Life is in you today and you make your tomorrow.
 - A philosophy can only be a route to knowledge. It cannot be knowledge crammed down one’s throat. If one has a route, he can then find what is true for him. And that is Scientology.

 - A civilization is as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamt by artists.
 - Man thrives, oddly enough, only in the presence of a challenging environment.
 - Communication is the universal solvent.
 - Morale is boosted to high highs by accomplishment. In fact, it can be demonstrated that production is the basis of morale.
 - A civilization without insanity, without criminals and without war, where the able can prosper and honest beings can have rights, and where man is free to rise to greater heights, are the aims of Scientology.
 - If a man can dream, if a man can have goals, he can be happy and he can be alive. If he has no goals he doesn’t even have a future.

 - The evolution of knowledge is toward simplicity, not complexity.
 - The artist injects the spirit of life into a culture.

 - Happiness is the overcoming of not unknown obstacles toward a known goal.
 - Freedom is for honest people. No man who is not himself honest can be free – he is his own trap.

 - The mind when it has an old experience will add that data into its current experience, and it keeps coming up with wrong answers.
 - Life in its highest state is understanding.
 - The ultimate freedom depends on knowing the ultimate Truth. Truth is not what people say it is, it is what it is. And Truth, quite remarkably, sets one free, just like philosophers have said down the ages.
 - That which one fears becomes one’s master.
 - Because the artist deals in future realities, he always seeks improvements or changes in the existing reality. This makes the artist, inevitably and invariably, a rebel against the status quo. The artist, day by day, by postulating the new realities of the future, accomplishes peaceful revolution.

 - Save the child and you save the nation.
 - Understanding has very specific component parts. These component parts are affinity, reality and communication.
 - Now, get this as a technical fact, not a hopeful idea. Every time we have investigated the background of a critic of Scientology, we have found crimes for which that person or group could be imprisoned under existing law. We do not find critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts.

 - What is true for you is what you have observed yourself. And when you lose that, you have lost everything.
 - I know no man who has any monopoly upon the wisdom of this universe. It belongs to those who can use it to help themselves and others.

 - Today’s children will become tomorrow’s civilization.
 - Unfortunately, it is all too often true that suppressors to a creative action must be removed before construction and creation takes place. Any person very high on the Tone Scale may level destruction toward a suppressor.
 - People attack Scientology, I never forget it, always even the score. People attack auditors, or staff, or organisations, or me. I never forget until the slate is clear.
 - The end and goal of any society as it addresses the problem of education is to raise the ability, the initiative and the cultural level, and with all these the survival level of that society.

 - Here on Earth there was undoubtedly a Christ.
 - A political system seeking to function amongst ignorant, illiterate and barbaric people could have marvelous principles but could only succeed in being ignorant, illiterate and barbaric unless one addressed the people one by one and cured the ignorance, illiteracy and barbarism of each citizen.

 - Always maintain good relations with your public.
 - Affection can no more spoil a child than the sun could be put out by a bucket of gasoline.

 - Ideas and not battles mark the forward progress of mankind.
 - Religion is the first sense of community. Your sense of community occurs by reason of mutual experience with others.
 - In all great leaders there is a purpose and intensity which is unmistakable.
 - God was feeling sardonic the day He created the Universe. So it’s rather up to at least one man every few centuries to pop up and come just as close to making him swallow his laughter as possible.
 - I believe that to command is to serve and only gives one the right to serve.
 - So we listen. We add up associations of people with people. When a push against Scientology starts somewhere, we go over the people involved and weed them out. Push vanishes.
