 - When you hear the splash Of the water drops that fall Into the stone bowl You will feel that all the dust Of your mind is washed away.
 - If you have one teapot And can brew your tea in it That will do quite well. How much does he lack himself Who must have a lot of things?
 - Tea is nought but this: first you heat the water, then you make the tea. Then you drink it properly. That is all you need to know.
