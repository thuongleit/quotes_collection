 - Our cities need to change, fast. Tactical Urbanism is a guided tour of solutions created when local people decide they can’t wait for politics to catch up before they improve their neighborhoods. This weathervane book deserves a place on any urbanist’s bookshelf.
 - Copenhagen has done a remarkable job creating streets that are focused on bicycles and pedestrians.
 - By looking at climate change as a clean energy generation problem, we’re setting ourselves up not to solve it.
 - It’s not just enough to survive. We’ve got to make something better than what we’ve got.
 - Urban retrofitting: creating different sorts of spaces and uses out of places that are already there.
 - Clean air and water, a diversity of animal and plant species, soil and mineral resources, and predictable weather are annuities that will pay dividends for as long as the human race survives – and may even extend our stay on Earth.
 - Cities generate most of the global economy, and most of its energy use, resource demands and climate emissions. How we build cities over the next decades will largely determine whether we can deliver a bright green future.
 - There’s no law of physics that says we have to be an unsustainable society – in fact, quite the opposite. The planet’s ready to work with us if we’re ready to think differently, but we do have to make that jump and start to do things in new ways.
 - You don’t change the world by hiding in the woods, wearing a hair shirt, or buying indulgences in the form of ‘Save the Earth’ bumper stickers. You do it by articulating a vision for the future and pursuing it with all the ingenuity humanity can muster.

 - Saying the Tech Bloom is not commercially driven is like saying Mother Teresa had an interest in the poor.
 - The planet’s biggest problems have to do with sustainability, environmental decline, global poverty, disease, conflict and so forth. Really, they’re all interconnected – it’s one big problem, which is that the way we’re doing things can’t go on.
 - By fundamentally changing how we design the places and systems that enable our daily lives, we can slash emissions way beyond the immediate carbon savings – because our own personal emissions are just the tip of a vast iceberg of energy and resources consumed far from our view.
 - Cities are responsible for the vast majority of the creation of the economy. They’re also places into which we pour the vast majority of resources, the vast majority of energy and the places where a huge percentage of the decisions about how systems are built and how products designed, etc., happen.
 - We have to craft new political realities, not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan, but here at home as well. Another world is possible.
 - Cities offer us powerful leverage on our most stubborn, wasteful practices. Long commutes in our cars, big power bills from our energy-hogging buildings, shopping trips to buy stuff that’ll spend a few short months in our homes and long centuries in our landfills.
