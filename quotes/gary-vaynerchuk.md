 - Storytelling is by far the most underrated skill in business.
 - Relationships are leverage. If you give value to someone else first, you have leverage.

 - Without hustle, talent will only carry you so far.
 - Keep saying hello to people. They will be the differentiator for you for the rest of your life.
 - True success – financial, personal, and professional – lies above all in loving your family, working hard, and living your passion. In telling your story. In authenticity, hustle, and patience. In caring fiercely about the big and the small stuff. In valuing legacy over currency.
 - If you’re not putting out relevant content in relevant places, you don’t exist.
 - It’s not how many followers you have, it’s how many care. It’s not width, it’s depth. It’s not how many impressions you get, it’s how much attention you get.
 - If you do not care about your end user immensely, especially in the next few years, your brand will die.
 - The truth is that finding happiness in what you do every day is so imperative.

 - Storytelling is the game. It’s what we all do.

 - One of my biggest flaws is I don’t take advice.
 - Remember the guy in the 80s walking around with a boombox on his shoulder? Why’d he do that? Because it told a story about who he was. Expressing yourself is big business.
 - There is no sale without the story; no knockout without the setup.
 - Social marketing is now a 24-7 job.
 - Stop doing things that waste time. Don’t replace time with your family or things that you need to do. I needed to put together two fantasy teams this weekend because that’s something I enjoy, but I did stop playing Nintendo Wii for hours on end.
 - It’s still so rare for anyone to be personally acknowledged by a brand that the impact of such a simple, polite gesture on a customer’s buying habits could be huge.
 - It’s important to build a personal brand because it’s the only thing you’re going to have. Your reputation online, and in the new business world is pretty much the game, so you’ve got to be a good person. You can’t hide anything, and more importantly, you’ve got to be out there at some level.
 - Social media is not a fad because it’s human.
 - I am aware of the talent I was gifted and had to execute against it. It is just being very self aware and betting on your best strength.

 - Know the philosophy, know the details, and ignore everything in the middle.
 - A lot of people can play the piano, but not everyone can be Billy Joel.
 - I want to own the New York Jets, that’s what I want. And I absolutely believe I am going to own the Jets.
 - I look at two things while angel investing. Are you solving an important problem? Do you care about the end users.
 - Care Immensely or Die: This is a bigger culture shift than you realize.
 - When the tech geeks talk, I pay close attention.
 - Today, getting people to hear your story on social media, and then act on it, requires using a platform’s native language, paying attention to context, understanding the nuances and subtle differences that make each platform unique, and adapting your content to match.
 - The chef that grew up with the grandma who cooks tends to always beat the chef that went to the culinary institute. It’s in the blood.

 - When people are using their devices, it’s probable that almost half are networking on social media.
 - I’m a storyteller. I love to tell stories about brands. I love to tell stories, period. I like painting pictures through the words, and that’s what I do.
 - The problem is, we’re all using social networks as distribution instead of native platforms to actually tell stories.
 - You can market your ass off, but if your product sucks, you’re dead.
 - If your organization’s intentions transcend the mere act of selling a product or service, and it is brave enough to expose its heart and soul, people will respond. They will connect. They will like you. They will talk. They will buy.
 - I always say that the real success of Wine Library wasn’t due to the videos I posted, but to the hours I spent talking to people online afterward, making connections and building relationships.
 - Never ever waver. Be on record. Don’t be on the wrong side of history.
 - More contact means more sharing of information, gossiping, exchanging, engaging – in short, more word of mouth.
 - While companies were getting comfy cozy with the idea of being on social media platforms, social media transcended those platforms, and few businesses have followed.
 - It’s about stories. If I can tell the story to America, whether it’s Riesling or a boxer from Harlem, it will sell. I know on my gravestone it’s going to be, ‘Storyteller.’
 - Your story isn’t powerful enough if all it does is lead the horse to water; it has to inspire the horse to drink, too. On social media, the only story that can achieve that goal is one told with native content.
 - Really, truly, try to figure out what your palate is all about. If you’ve determined that you don’t like dirty old stinky wine – old-world flavors – you probably like new-world fruit bombs. Stick to Shirazes and California Cabernets or Zinfandels.
 - What makes a good client, to me, is one that signed on for the strategy as well as the execution, not just the end product.
 - Now, if you truly understand how marketing works today, you know there is no individual six-month campaign; there’s only the 365-day campaign, during which you produce new content daily.
 - What’s the ROI of your mum? You can’t put a value on a relationship.

 - Anyone working for a big company might be skeptical that a large business, or even a strictly online business, can form the same kind of friendly, loyal relationship with customers as a local retailer. I’m saying it’s already been done because I lived it.
 - If you talk about Cabernet and Merlot-based value between $10 and $25, I will tell you that Bordeaux is the best value in the world.

 - The Loire Valley is grossly underestimated. The prices are fair, and the wines are real.

 - When it call comes down to it, nothing trumps execution.
 - I hate recording all the shows for the week in one day, because I want to be able to mention current events and pop culture. If Madonna punches Britney in the face today, I want to reference that on ‘Wine Library TV’ tomorrow. Monday’s episode is always the best, because it’s hot off the press.
 - We’re sharing things in our lives everyday that we wouldn’t have picked up the phone to talk about ten years ago.
 - Hustle is waking up the day before you die and realising you gave it your all.
 - On Facebook, the definition of great content is not the content that makes the most sales, but the content that people most want to share with others.
 - Market like the year you are in.
 - Don’t worry; skills are cheap, passion is priceless. If you’re passionate about your content and you know it and do it better than anyone else, even with few formal business skills you have the potential to create a million-dollar business.
 - A penguin cannot become a giraffe, so just be the best penguin you can be.

 - I genuinely believe that any business can create a competitive advantage through giving outstanding customer care.
 - You cannot underestimate the sharpness of people’s BS radar. They can spot a soulless, bureaucratic tactic a million miles away.

 - Great marketing is all about telling your story in such a way that it compels people to buy what you are selling.
 - If you know exactly what you want to be, you need to spend as much time as possible with people who are actually that already...
 - No matter who you are or what kind of company or organization you work for, your number-one job is to tell your story to the consumer wherever they are, and preferably at the moment they are deciding to make a purchase.
 - I want people to know their palate is a snowflake. We all like different things. Why should we all have the same taste in wines?
 - Someone with less passion and talent and poorer content can totally beat you if they’re willing to work longer and harder than you are. Hustle is it.
 - I attract a crowd, not because I’m an extrovert or I’m over the top or I’m oozing with charisma. It’s because I care.
 - Okay, let’s talk about cartoon labels for half a second – some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It’s, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it’s actually a solid wine.

 - I influence anybody who is able to get through the chaos of my first impression.
 - I pride myself in listening. When you have people paying attention to you, your biggest job is to listen what they want. Deliver what your community wants.
 - Your story needs to move people’s spirits and build their goodwill, so that when you finally do ask them to buy from you, they feel like you’ve given them so much it would be almost rude to refuse.
 - I do not believe that people want to work hard enough and they want to find the quick Twitter, SEO. Anybody who’s obsessed with SEO has lost already, period. I believe that firmly.

 - I’m not afraid to call a wine that tastes like Skittles or green peppers mixed with orange marmalade. I’ll say, ‘It tastes like chicken.’ I mean, that’s not what people think of when they think of wine, but that’s what it tastes like to me and it hits home.

 - It scares the living crap out of me how good wine is at ten dollars.
 - We are living at the beginning of the humanization of business.

 - I’m concerned a little bit with the culture of celebrating the fundraise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money it’s the worst day of your life.
 - If there’s a problem, we at Wine Library never tell ourselves that once we handle this issue, we’ll never have to deal with the person again. We talk to every single person as though we’re going to wind up sitting next to that person at his or her mother’s house that night for dinner.
