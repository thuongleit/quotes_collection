 - My motto is, ‘When in doubt, shoot the ball’
 - I just try to just roll with the punches. I mean, once the team pretty much starts closing out, just try to get in attack mode, and at the same time, try to find my teammates. It’s kind of hard, hitting the shots I was hitting, to try and pass the ball, but you’ve got to figure out a way.
 - The reality is I’m kind of like an ocean. Everything is calm, calm, calm. I’m good. When the ball goes up in the air, the waves start rocking.
 - If you don’t get offended by somebody scoring on you then I don’t know what to tell you. That is like somebody breaking into your house and just taking your video game out of your hand and you just let it happen. I know if you do that to me, it ain’t going to happen. I love my Xbox.
 - Trying to think about the rest of the team over myself or my scoring is something that I never really had to do before.
 - I’m not worried about Instagram.
