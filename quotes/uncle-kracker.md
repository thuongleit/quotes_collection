 - You make me smile like the sun, fall out bed, sing like a bird, dizzy in my head. Spin like a record crazy on a sunday night. You make me dance like a fool, forget how to breath, shine like the sun buzz like a bee, just the thought of you can drive me wild. Oh you make me smile. -Uncle Kracker-.
 - I am an avid drinker with a serious bowling problem.
 - The only thing that kept me out of college was high school.
 - I am a dog that loves my fleas.
