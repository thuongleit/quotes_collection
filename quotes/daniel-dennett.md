 - There may be things that are completely unknowable to us, so we must be careful not to treat the limits of our knowledge as sure guides to the limit of what there is.
 - It’s a no win situation. It’s a mug’s game. The religions have contrived to make it impossible to disagree with them critically without being rude. They play the hurt feelings card at every opportunity.

 - Churches have given us great treasures such as music and architecture. Whether that pays for the harm they have done is another matter.
 - There is no such thing as philosophy-free science, just science that has been conducted without any consideration of its underlying philosophical assumptions.
 - Love is blind, as they say, and because love is blind, it often leads to tragedy: to conflicts in which one love is pitted against another love, and something has to give, with suffering guaranteed in any resolution.

 - Religions have depended on the relative isolation and ignorance of their flocks, forever and this is all breaking down.
 - The evidence for evolution pours in, not only from geology, paleontology, biogeography, and anatomy, but of course from molecular biology and every other branch of the life sciences.
 - I am a philosopher, not a scientist, and we philosophers are better at questions than answers.
 - I don’t myself need that role for God. My view is that creation itself, the universe itself, is the most wonderful thing deserving awe and respect. And that satisfies me as my substitute for God.
 - People ache to believe that we human beings are vastly different from all other species – and they are right! We are different. We are the only species that has an extra medium of design preservation and design communication: culture.

 - There are no forces on this planet more dangerous to all of us than the fanaticisms of fundamentalism.
 - The mind is the effect, not the cause.

 - The problem is that no ethical system has ever achieved consensus. Ethical systems are completely unlike mathematics or science. This is a source of concern.
 - You can’t get through seminary and come out believing in God!
 - Some cultural phenomena bear a striking resemblance to the cells of cell biology, actively preserving themselves in their social environments, finding the nutrients they need and fending off the causes of their dissolution.
 - The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task, it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn’t need its brain anymore so it eats it!
 - True, you don’t have to be religious to be crazy, but it helps.
 - Some of the greatest, most revolutionary advances in science have been given their initial expression in attractively modest terms, with no fanfare.

 - Problems in science are sometimes made easier by adding complications.
 - In the beginning, there were no reasons; there were only causes. Nothing had a purpose, nothing has so much as a function; there was no teleology in the world at all.

 - Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on the planet, and we hold the paintbrush.

 - The only meaning of life worth caring about is one that can withstand our best efforts to examine it.
 - Words are memes that can be pronounced.
 - Consciousness is cerebral celebrity – nothing more and nothing less. Those contents are conscious that persevere, that monopolize resources long enough to achieve certain typical and “symptomatic” effects – on memory, on the control of behavior and so forth.
 - It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet. Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy. We adore babies because they’re so cute. And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.
 - A child raised on a desert island, alone, without social interaction, without language, and thus lacking empathy, is still a sentient being.
 - We need to let our children grow up to face the world armed with knowledge, with much more knowledge than we ourselves had at their age. It is scary, but the alternative is worse.

 - Sometimes you don’t just want to risk making mistakes; you actually want to make them – if only to give you something clear and detailed to fix.
 - Wherever there is a design that is highly successful in a broad range of similar environments, it is apt to emerge again and again, independently – the phenomenon known in biology as convergent evolution. I call these designs ‘good tricks.’
