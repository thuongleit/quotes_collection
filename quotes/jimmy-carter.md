 - We have a tendency to condemn people who are different from us, to define their sins as paramount and our own sinfulness as being insignificant.

 - When I was elected President nobody asked me to negotiate between Israel and Egypt. It was not even a question raised in my campaign. But I felt that one of the reasons that I was elected President was to try to bring peace to the Holy Land.
 - We cannot be both the world’s leading champion of peace and the world’s leading supplier of the weapons of war.

 - There should be an honest attempt at the reconciliation of differences before resorting to combat.
 - Habitat gives us an opportunity which is very difficult to find: to reach out and work side by side with those who never have had a decent home-but work with them on a completely equal basis. It’s not a big-shot, little-shot relationship. It’s a sense of equality.

 - You always get back much more than you give.

 - Two problems of our country – energy and malaise.

 - One of the surprising things that Brezhnev said when we were in our talks, was – when I proposed that we make these changes in nuclear weaponry, he said, “God will never forgive us if we don’t succeed.” And, you know, coming from the leader of an atheistic communist country, this surprised everyone.

 - I am convinced that UFOs exist because I’ve seen one...

 - The heart and mind of every Muslim is affected by whether or not the Israel-Palestine issue is dealt with fairly.
 - The Carter Center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication. Which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the Earth. In the history of the world, there’s only been one disease eradicated: smallpox. The second disease, I think, is gonna be guinea worm.
 - We have a special relationship with Israel. It’s absolutely crucial that no one in our country or around the world ever doubt that our number one committment in the Middle East is to protect the right of Israel to exist, to exist permanently, and to exist in peace. It’s a special relationship.
 - I’ve used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible. And secondly, I’ve still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth.
 - We’ve uncovered some embarrassing ancestors in the not-too-distant past. Some horse thieves, and some people killed on Saturday nights. One of my relatives, unfortunately, was even in the newspaper business.

 - We all know grandparents whose values transcend passing fads and pressures, and who possess the wisdom of distilled pain and joy.

 - Communicating our questions, hopes, and fears in prayer makes them-even to ourselves-more open and clear...
 - I’m not in favor of the government mandating a prayer in school because our country was founded on the fact that no particular religious faith would have ascendance over or preferential treatment over any other.
 - The awareness that health is dependent upon habits that we control makes us the first generation in history that to a large extent determines its own destiny.
 - I am pro-Israeli, not because of political expediency, but because I believe Israel is the fulfillment of Biblical prophecy.

 - Christians are supposed to be evangelicals. And I am. I am evangelical.
 - Americans long thought that nature could take care of itself-or that if it did not, the consequences were someone else’s problem. As we know now, that assumption was wrong; none of us is a stranger to environmental problems.

 - We are a purely idealistic Nation but let no one confuse our idealism with weakness.
 - But love must be aggressively translated into simple justice.
 - A strong nation, like a strong person, can afford to be gentle, firm, thoughtful, and restrained. It can afford to extend a helping hand to others. It’s a weak nation, like a weak person, that must behave with bluster and boasting and rashness and other signs of insecurity.

 - This afternoon, I’ve arranged for this ceremony to be illuminated by solar power.
 - I don’t think that the total creation took place in six days as we now measure time. If we can confirm, say, the Big Bang theory, that doesn’t at all cause me to question my faith that God created the Big Bang.
 - In the United States, you might say every county has got its own separate system. There’s not even one kind of ballot that you use all over the United States. We require that in a foreign country.
 - The reduction of nuclear arsenals and the removal of the threat of worldwide nuclear destruction is a measure, in my judgment, ofthe power and strength of a great nation.
 - My constant prayer, my number one foreign goal, is to bring peace to Israel. And in the process to Israel’s neighbours.
 - Our laws were not designed to accommodate three or four thousand refugees coming here per day. Our laws were designed for people to be screened in a foreign country, carefully catalogued, and brought here a few at a time. This just didn’t happen.

 - The founding of our Nation was more than a political event; it was an act of faith, a promise to Americans and to the entire world. The Declaration of Independence declared that people can govern themselves, that they can live in freedom with equal rights, that they can respect the rights of others.
 - The President publicly apologized today to all those offended by his brother’s remark, There’s more Arabs in this country than there is Jews! Those offended include Arabs, Jews, and English teachers.

 - When the laws are written and administered by the most powerful leaders in a society, it is human nature for them to understand, justify, and protect the interests of themselves and people like them. Many injustices arise from this natural human failing.

 - My favourite president, and the one I admired most, was Harry Truman.
 - The Bible and studying the Bible has been an important part of my life.

 - I don’t want to tell President Obama how to make a speech. He’s a much better speech maker than I am. But I think always to tell the truth in a sometimes blatant way, even though it might be temporarily unpopular, is the best approach.
 - I had very good support from Democrats and Republicans all throughout my administration. I had a very high batting average. We added more jobs per year in my four years than any other president since the Second World War.

 - It’s very difficult for the American people to believe that our government, one of the richest on Earth, is also one of the stingiest on Earth.

 - The pre-eminent obstacle to peace is Israel’s colonization of Palestine.
 - Even for the world’s only superpower, the ends don’t always justify the means.
 - I would describe fundamentalism as, first of all, a movement led almost invariably by authoritarian males who consider themselves to be superior to others and who have an overwhelming commitment to subjugate women and to dominate their fellow believers.

 - We believe that the first time we’re born, as children, it’s human life given to us; and when we accept Jesus as our Savior, it’s a new life. That’s what “born again” means.
 - I can’t really criticize the Tea Party people, because I came into the White House pretty much on the same basis that they have become popular. That is dissatisfaction with the way things are going in Washington and disillusionment and disencouragement about the government.
 - I think I was identified as a failed president because I wasn’t re-elected.
 - Quite often, the people who do leave their own nation and come to an unknown destination, like the United States, are inherently adventurous, so we’ve had that adventurous spirit that has embedded itself collectively in the American consciousness.
 - I officially designated every US ambassador on earth to be my personal human rights representative, and to have the embassy be a haven for people who suffered from abuse by their own government.

 - In a nuclear age, each of us is threatened when peace is not secured everywhere.
 - You just have to have a simple faith.
 - Nearly all inmates are drawn from the ranks of the powerless and the poor. A child of privilege frequently receives the benefit of the doubt; a child of poverty seldom does.
 - The United States is squandering international prestige and goodwill and intensifying global anti-American terrorism by unofficially condoning or abetting the Israeli confiscation and colonization of Palestinian territories.
 - I believed what my father taught me about the separation of church and state, so when I was President I never invited Billy Graham to have services in the White House because I didn’t think that was appropriate. He was injured a little bit, until I explained it to him.
 - I don’t think the Tea Party people are racist, except maybe a tiny portion of them. But there has been a deliberate effort – again, referring to Fox Broadcasting – to inject the race issue into it. They have actually called Obama a racist on television.
 - I think all of us could insist on preserving the truth and preserving the peace. We could insist that political candidates tell the truth about controversial issues. And secondly, we should be sure to encourage our political leaders, after they’re elected, to preserve the peace.

 - Building confidence and constructive relations between Sudan and South Sudan is urgent.
 - I’ve been an evangelistic Baptist all my life and still am to some degree.
 - My life since the White House has been much more all-encompassing, much more enjoyable. The main thing that I’ve acquired has been access to the poorest and most destitute, forgotten, and suffering people on Earth. It’s not possible for a President to actually know them.
 - I have been in love with the Palestinian people for many years. I have two great-grandsons that are rapidly learning about the people here and the anguish and suffering and deprivation of human rights that you have experienced ever since 1948.
 - Thoughtful criticism and close scrutiny of all government officials by the press and the public are an important part of our democratic society.
 - I can’t think of a man more worthy of the presidency then my good friend Sam Nunn.
 - Ever since Israel has been a nation the United States has provided the leadership. Every president down to the ages has done this in a fairly balanced way, including George Bush senior, Gerald Ford, and others including myself and Bill Clinton.
 - I don’t claim to be knowledgeable about theology. Most of my knowledge comes out of my experience and the lessons in the Bible. Every Sunday I’m home I teach 45 minutes and we boiled them down to one page for the new book, ‘Through the Year with Jimmy Carter.’
