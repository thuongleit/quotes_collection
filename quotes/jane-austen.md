 - I am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.

 - It is not every man’s fate to marry the woman who loves him best.
 - It is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does. And men take care that they should.

 - They parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again.

 - I am not fond of the idea of my shrubberies being always approachable.
 - Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! Worse than cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. – Marianne Dashwood.
 - They are much to be pitied who have not been given a taste for nature early in life.

 - The truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.
 - A lady, without a family, was the very best preserver of furniture in the world.
 - Where people are really attached, poverty itself is wealth.
 - I have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.
 - To look almost pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has been looking plain for the first fifteen years of her life than a beauty from her cradle can ever receive.
 - I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort. A large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it.

 - Had I not been bound to silence I could have provided proof enough of a broken heart, even for you.
 - From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but I am now convinced.

 - Good-humoured, unaffected girls, will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They are two distinct orders of being.
 - Now they were as strangers; nay worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.
 - I am determined that only the deepest love will induce me into matrimony. So, I shall end an old maid, and teach your ten children to embroider cushions and play their instruments very ill.
 - They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects.
 - I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman’s inconstancy. Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman’s fickleness. But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men.
 - I think I may boast myself to be, with all possible vanity, the most unlearned and uninformed female who ever dared to be an authoress.
