 - If you can’t do the little things right, you will never do the big things right.
 - I think the best way to get a good night sleep is to work hard throughout the day. If you work hard and, of course, work out.
 - If you want to change the world, find someone to help you paddle.
 - And if by chance you have a miserable day, you will come home to a bed that is made – that you made – and a made bed gives you encouragement that tomorrow will be better.
 - You cant change the world alone – you will need some help – and to truly get from your starting point to your destination takes friends, colleagues, the good will of strangers and a strong coxswain to guide them.
