 - Vision with action can change the world.
 - I have always longed to be part of the outward life, to be out there at the edge of things, to let the human taint wash away in emptiness and silence as the fox sloughs his smell into the cold unworldliness of water; to return to town a stranger. Wandering flushes a glory that fades with arrival.
 - Wandering flushes a glory that fades with arrival.
 - Whatever is destroyed, the act of destruction does not vary much. Beauty if vapour from the pit of death.
