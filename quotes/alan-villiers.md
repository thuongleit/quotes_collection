 - Only fools and passengers drink at sea.
 - There is little man has made that approaches anything in nature, but a sailing ship does. There is not much man has made that calls to all the best in him, but a sailing ship does.
 - The singing of sea shanties as working songs at sea is a lost art.
 - Every ship should have a cat.
