 - Employees who believe that management is concerned about them as a whole person – not just an employee – are more productive, more satisfied, more fulfilled. Satisfied employees mean satisfied customers, which leads to profitability.
 - Turnaround or growth, it’s getting your people focused on the goal that is still the job of leadership.
 - When you have that window of opportunity called a crisis, move as quickly as you can, get as much done as you can. There’s a momentum for change that’s very compelling.
 - What do you really believe makes a difference in the company? For me it’s really clear. It’s about customers and employees. Everything else follows. If you take care of your customers and you have motivated employees, everything else follows.

 - One of the things we often miss in succession planning is that it should be gradual and thoughtful, with lots of sharing of information and knowledge and perspective, so that it’s almost a non-event when it happens.
 - Whenever an earthquake or tsunami takes thousands of innocent lives, a shocked world talks of little else. I’ll never forget the wrenching days I spent in Haiti last year for Save the Children just weeks after the earthquake.
 - We’re living in a different world now in terms of employee needs, and companies have to offer alternative methods for getting the work done. Even under the most difficult circumstances you can have creative flexibility.
 - Sustainable development is a proven catalyst for Xerox innovation.
 - I have zero tolerance for people who don’t come completely prepared. I expect contribution, I expect attendance, and I expect directors to take trips and visit the company’s programs.
 - I’m not formal and I’m impatient. So I think my team would say that when she starts tapping her pen and the leg starts moving quickly, that it’s time to move on. I’m not good at long, drawn-out kinds of sessions.
 - Customers require the effective integration of technologies to simplify their workflow and boost efficiency.
 - When parents are confident that their children will live, they have fewer of them. They invest more in each child’s food, health and education.
 - I learned how to be a learner. When you get in a job, the tendency is to say, ‘I’ve got to know it. I’ve got to give direction to others. I’m in this job because I’m better and smarter.’ I always took a different view, that the key was to identify the people who really knew and learn from them.
 - My dad was an editor and a writer, and that’s really where I would have liked to have gone. But the genetic link was not intact there, so I wound up going into business. But I love to write, still. I’m not a great writer, but I enjoy it.
 - There is an explosion of information happening, yet people demand quick access to relevant content that cuts through the clutter.
 - Not everybody is created equal, and it’s important for companies to identify those high potentials and treat them differently, accelerate their development and pay them more. That process is so incredibly important to developing first-class leadership in a company.
 - As much as it’s sometimes hard to make choices about where you invest, it’s equally hard to make choices about where you don’t invest and what you eliminate.
 - Boards without women – blacklist those suckers. It’s 2011. They’ve had the time – it’s significant that they don’t have women.
 - We’re long past having to defend or explain why women should be on boards, given all the data that shows how companies with female as well as male directors perform better. It’s unfortunate when companies with a large percentage of women constituents don’t reflect that in their boardrooms.
 - The hardware business is all about per-unit manufacturing cost and functionality. The services business is less asset-intensive and more dependent on people.
 - There’s nothing quite as powerful as people feeling they can have impact and make a difference. When you’ve got that going for you, I think it’s a very powerful way to implement change.

 - I’m at the gym at 6, so I’m usually in my office by 7:15. And I try to not schedule a lot of meetings before 8. So I’ve got that first hour to get myself organized for the day and to make sure that I’ve structured what I want to do.
 - I got a journalism degree. I started doing journalism – I interned at ‘Cosmopolitan’ magazine in the 1970s, which probably wasn’t the best place for me, and I spent six or nine months freelancing. Anyway, I wasn’t that good at it.
 - Most of my career has been in sales. I spend 50% or more of my time with customers and employees, and I can’t wait for it to be more than 50%.
 - By the time I stepped down as Xerox’s CEO in 2009 – and as chairman in January 2010 – Xerox had become the vibrant, profitable and revitalized company that it still is today. What made the difference was a strong turnaround plan, dedicated people and a firm commitment from company leaders.
