 - We are stronger than we think. We have emotional, spiritual and even physical resources at our disposal. We may get knocked down, but we don’t have to stay down.
 - We could all do with a bit more joy in our lives couldn’t we? The wonderful thing is that when we start spreading joy, we begin to actually experience more joy in our lives too!
