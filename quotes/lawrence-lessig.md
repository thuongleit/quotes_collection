 - Money corrupts the process of reasoning.
 - Law and technology produce, together, a kind of regulation of creativity we’ve not seen before.
 - In these times, the hardest task for social or political activists is to find a way to get people to wonder again about what we all believe is true. The challenge is to sow doubt.
 - Creativity is enhanced by less-than-perfect control over what content is on the network.
 - It’s fine to talk about politics with people you agree with. But it is rude to argue about politics with people you disagree with. Political discourse becomes isolated, and isolated discourse becomes more extreme.
 - Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a crucially important legal device.
 - We are on the cusp of this time where I can say, “I speak as a citizen of the world” without others saying, God, what a nut.
 - I don’t support direct democracy because I want a life, and that means I want to select people who work for me who do that sort of work for me.
 - In a time of polarized politics there’s one thing that more than ninety percent of Americans agree on, that our government is broken, and broken because of the money in politics.
 - Companies will often use the legal system to scare people away from attacking them. But we all should be free to make critical statements about anybody, unless those statements are malicious.
 - If you are explaining, you’re losing. It’s a bumper sticker culture. People have to get it like that, and if they don’t, if it takes three seconds to make them understand, you’re off their radar screen. Three seconds to understand, or you lose. This is our problem.
 - Technology means you can now do amazing things easily; but you couldn’t easily do them legally.
 - The danger in media concentration comes not from the concentration, but instead from the feudalism that this concentration, tied to the change in copyright, produces.
 - Creativity and innovation always builds on the past. The past always tries to control the creativity that builds upon it. Free societies enable the future by limiting this power of the past. Ours is less and less a free society.
 - If the Internet teaches us anything, it is that great value comes from leaving core resources in a commons, where they’re free for people to build upon as they see fit.
 - Before the monopoly should be permitted, there must be reason to believe it will do some good – for society, and not just for monopoly holders.

 - While appropriation art is critical to art, it’s an ambiguous art form in the world of the Supreme Court.
 - I’m all for experimenting with sortition – randomly selected representative bodies of citizens. But I don’t favor direct democracy. We’re busy. We have lives. There is reddit. Who has time to work out the right answer to the thousand policy choices a gov’t must make all the time?
 - A free culture is not a culture without property; it is not a culture in which artists don’t get paid.

 - Copyrights have not expired, and will not expire, so long as Congress is free to be bought to extend them again.
 - I don’t care if the Koch brothers or Soros spend their money to promote one candidate or another. I care about members of Congress spending 30%-70% of their time raising money from .05% of us. Change the way we fund elections and you change the corruption.
 - One great feature of modern society is the institutionalized respect we give to processes designed to destroy the past.
 - I’m focused on solving the problem that would make it plausible for gov’t to get back to solving real problems.
 - Change the way we fund campaigns. Until we do, Wall Street will always be able to blackmail the Dems and GOP to giving them what Wall Street wants.
 - A free culture has been our past, but it will only be our future if we change the path we are on right now.

 - Americans have been selling this view around the world: that progress comes from perfect protection of intellectual property.
 - Remember the refrain: We always build on the past; the past always tries to stop us. Freedom is about stopping the past, but we have lost that ideal.
 - We have a massive system to regulate creativity. A massive system of lawyers regulating creativity as copyright law has expanded in unrecognizable forms, going from a regulation of publishing to a regulation of copying.
 - Overregulation stifles creativity. It smothers innovation. It gives dinosaurs a veto over the future. It wastes the extraordinary opportunity for a democratic creativity that digital technology enables.
 - A world where Congressmen spend 30 to 70 percent of their time raising money from a tiny, tiny fraction of the 1% is a world where that tiny, tiny fraction has enormous power. And it’s that inequality in political power that enables this corrupted system to happen.
 - Notwithstanding the fact that the most innovative and progressive space we’ve seen – the Internet – has been the place where intellectual property has been least respected. You know, facts don’t get in the way of this ideology.
 - I think if the copyright regime focuses on the people we are supposed to be helping, the artists and creators, and builds a system that gives them the freedom to choose and to protect and to be rewarded for their creativity, then we will have the right focus.

 - We always build on the past; the past always tries to stop us.
 - While the creative works from the 16th century can still be accessed and used by others, the data in some software programs from the 1990s is already inaccessible.
 - When you think about a presidential candidate spending all of his or her time talking to that tiny, tiny fraction of us who have the capacity to fund political elections, it’s obvious why the perspective of government is skewed relative to what most Americans care about.
 - So uncritically do we accept the idea of property in culture that we don’t even question when the control of that property removes our ability, as a people, to develop our culture democratically.

 - Legislation needs a better reason than that lawyers like it, and that America does it.
 - Show me why your regulation of culture is needed. Show me how it does good. And until you can show me both, keep your lawyers away.
 - Overregulation corrupts citizens and weakens the rule of law.
 - Now that copyrights can be just about a century long, the inability to know what is protected and what is not protected becomes a huge and obvious burden on the creative process.

 - Some may not like the Constitution’s requirements, but that doesn’t make the Constitution a pirate’s charter.
 - This does not mean that every copyright must prove its value initially. That would be a far too cumbersome system of control. But it does mean that every system or category of copyright or patent should prove its worth.
 - We established a regime that left creativity unregulated. Now it was unregulated because copyright law only covered “printing.” Copyright law did not control derivative work. And copyright law granted this protection for the limited time of 14 years.
 - The current term of protection for software is the life of an author plus 70 years, or, if it’s work-for-hire, a total of 95 years. This is a bastardization of the Constitution’s requirement that copyright be for “limited times.”
 - For however much the state may gain by not having to fund roads on its own, society would lose in aggregate if the open commons of transportation were lost.

 - When government disappears, its not as if paradise will take its place. When governments are gone, other interests will take their place.
 - As I’ve indicated, most books go out of print within one year. The same is true of music and film. Commercial culture is sharklike. It must keep moving. And when a creative work falls out of favor with the commercial distributors, the commercial life ends.
 - All around us are the consequences of the most significant technological, and hence cultural, revolution in generations.
 - If there were two candidates, a Democrat and a Republican, who each committed to the same kind of fundamental reform, then the election would be an election between the vice presidential candidates. It’d be just like the regular election, except it would be one step down.
 - Monopoly controls have been the exception in free societies; they have been the rule in closed societies.
 - Politics is that rare sport where the amateur contest is actually more interesting than the professional.
