 - Be yourself. Follow your instincts. Success depends, at least in part, on the ability to ‘carry it off.’
 - Success tends to go not to the person who is error-free, because he also tends to be risk-averse. Rather it goes to the person who recognizes that life is pretty much a percentage business. It isn’t making mistakes that’s critical; it’s correcting them and getting on with the principal task.

 - Imagine, a September 11 with weapons of mass destruction. It’s not 3,000. It’s tens of thousands of innocent men, women and children.
 - When you’re skiing, if you’re not falling you’re not trying.
 - In our system leadership is by consent, not command. To lead a President must persuade. Personal contacts and experiences help shape his thinking. They can be critical to his persuasiveness and thus to his leadership.

 - The country cannot afford amateur hour in the White House.

 - Arguments of convenience lack integrity and inevitably trip you up.
 - Don’t necessarily avoid sharp edges. Occasionally they are necessary to leadership.

 - I cannot give any assurances. I’m not in that business. I haven’t been, and I don’t intend to get into it. People who try to make predictions about things or assurances often find they’re wrong.
 - The most underestimated risk for a politician is overexposure.
 - Don’t divide the world into ‘them’ and ‘us.’ Avoid infatuation with or resentment of the press, the Congress, rivals, or opponents. Accept them as facts. They have their jobs and you have yours.
 - Don’t be a bottleneck. If a matter is not a decision for the President or you, delegate it. Force responsibility down and out. Find problem areas, add structure and delegate. The pressure is to do the reverse. Resist it.
