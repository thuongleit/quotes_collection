 - Memory has its own special kind. It selects, eliminates, alters, exaggerates, minimizes, glorifies, and vilifies also; but in the end it creates its own reality, its heterogeneous but usually coherent version of events; and no sane human being ever trusts someone else’s version more than his own.

 - Travel was pointless. It removed you from the place in which you had a meaning, and to which you gave meaning in return by dedicating your life to it, and it spirited you away into fairylands where you were, and looked, frankly absurd.
 - I admit it: above all things, I fear absurdity.

 - What kind of Christmas present would Jesus ask Santa for?
 - Our lives disconnect and reconnect, we move on, and later we may again touch one another, again bounce away. This is the felt shape of a human life, neither simply linear nor wholly disjunctive nor endlessly bifurcating, but rather this bouncey-castle sequence of bumpings-into and tumblings-apart.
 - I don’t think people cry reading ‘Midnight’s Children,’ but a lot of people seem to cry watching the movie.

 - Children are the vessels into which adults pour their poison.
 - Friendships are the family we make – not the one we inherit. I’ve always been someone to whom friendship, elective affinities, is as important as family.
 - Live on, survive, for the earth gives forth wonders. It may swallow your heart, but the wonders keep on coming. You stand before them bareheaded, shriven. What is expected of you is attention.

 - A photograph is a moral decision taken in one eighth of a second, or one sixteenth, or one one-hundred-and-twenty-eighth. Snap your fingers; a snapshot’s faster.
 - One of the things I’ve thought about ‘Midnight’s Children’ is that it is a novel which puts a Muslim family at the centre of the Indian experience.
 - The First Amendment defends all forms of speech including hate speech, which is why groups like Ku Klux Klan are allowed to utter their poisonous remarks.
 - People don’t like being around despair. Our tolerance for the truly hopeless, for those who are irredeemably broken by life is strictly limited. The sob stories we like are the ones that end before we’re bored.
 - The West should be tougher on Pakistan. It is trying to play both ends against the middle – to look like the friend of the revolutionaries on the one hand and a friend of the West in the fight against terrorism. It can’t be both things.
 - One of the things I’ve learnt is not to depend on there being a woman in your life to make it work. I love my work, I love my children, I’ve got wonderful friends, you know, I have a nice life.
 - My heart broke open and history fell in.
 - A thing that happens to migrants is that they lose many of the traditional things which root identity, which root the self.
 - So when I studied history at Cambridge, I did a special subject in that, exactly that. And then actually that – while I was studying it was where I came across the so-called incident of the satanic verses.
 - Rock and roll music – the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms.
 - In early Islam, it was an absolute tenet that the prophet was not to be worshipped. The prophet was a messenger. And one of the things that’s happened in Islam is this cult of the prophet, which to my view is counter to the original tradition.
 - If the culture shifts, if people think differently about women, the art will shift, too. You can’t ask art to make social change. It’s not what it’s for.
 - India, the new myth – a collective fiction in which anything was possible, a fable rivalled only by the two other mighty fantasies: money and God.
 - I do not envy people who think they have a complete explanation of the world, for the simple reason that they are obviously wrong.
 - Too many people spouting too many words, and in the end those words will turn to bullets and stones.
 - Your blasphemy, Salman, can’t be forgiven. To set your words against the Words of God.
 - An attack upon our ability to tell stories is not just censorship – it is a crime against our nature as human beings.

 - The West was involved in toppling the Mossadegh government. That ultimately led to the Iranian revolution.
 - If you take a look at history, you will find that the understanding of what is good and evil has always existed before the individual religions. The religions were only invented by people afterwards, in order to express this idea.

 - Speaking as somebody with three sisters and a very largely female Muslim family, there is not a single woman I know in my family or in their friends who would have accepted the wearing of a veil.

 - There is nothing like a War for the reinvention of lives...
 - Why speak if you can’t manage perfect thoughts, perfect sentences?
 - Cruelty is not a literary value.

 - The history of a culture can be determined by its untranslatable words.
 - So India’s problem turns out to be the world’s problem. What happened in India has happened in God’s name. The problem’s name is God.
 - I make no complaint. I am a writer. I do not accept my condition; I will strive to change it; but I inhabit it, I am trying to learn from it.
 - Everything has shape, if you look for it. There is no escape from form.
 - When I was growing up, everyone around me was fond of fooling around with words. It was certainly common in my family, but I think it is typical of Bombay, and maybe of India, that there is a sense of play in the way people use language.
 - The acceptance that all that is solid has melted into the air, that reality and morality are not givens but imperfect human constructs, is the point from which fiction begins.
 - Originality is dangerous. It challenges, questions, overturns assumptions, unsettles moral codes.
 - Human beings do not perceive things whole; we are not gods but wounded creatures, cracked lenses, capably only of fractured perceptions. Partial beings, in all the senses of that phrase.
 - We are described into corners, and then we must describe ourselves out of corners.
 - There is no magic on earth strong enough to wipe out the legacies of one’s parents.
 - To see things plainly, you have to cross a frontier.
 - When I was writing ‘The Satanic Verses,’ if you had asked me about the phenomenon that we all now know as radical Islam, I wouldn’t have had much to say. As recently as the mid-1980s, it didn’t seem to be a big deal.
 - It may be argued that the past is a country from which we have all emigrated, that its loss is part of our common humanity.

 - The history of life was not the bumbling progress – the very English, middle-class progress – Victorian thought had wanted it to be, but violent, a thing of dramatic, cumulative transformations: in the old formulation, more revolution than evolution.
 - I have been a film buff all my life and believe that the finest cinema is fully the equal of the best novels.

 - Anyone who has had the experience of going through American security checks knows the purpose of these checks is not to make you safer; it’s just to annoy you.
 - If Woody Allen were a Muslim, he’d be dead by now.
 - What happened in Pakistan was that people were told: You’re all Muslim, so now you’re a country. As we saw in 1971 with the Bangladesh secession, the answer to that was: ‘Oh no, we’re not.’
 - The Republicans were not always insane. They might’ve had politics I didn’t agree with, but they weren’t always actually certifiable.
 - It is commonly and, I believe, accurately said of Pakistan that her women are much more impressive than her men.
 - Exile is a dream of a glorious return. Exile is a vision of revolution: Elba, not St Helena. It is an endless paradox: looking forward by always looking back. The exile is a ball hurled high into the air.
 - Bin Laden was born filthy rich and died in a rich man’s house, which he had painstakingly built to the highest specifications.
 - The Muslim population in India is, largely speaking, not radicalised. From the beginning, they were always very secular-minded.

 - A relationship with an imaginary woman is preferable to a relationship with a real one.
 - One either loves, or waits for love, or banishes love for good. That is the full range of possible choices.
 - Airport security exists to guard us against terrorist attacks.
 - In this world without quiet corners, there can be no easy escapes from history, from hullabaloo, from terrible, unquiet fuss.
 - Names, once they are in common use, quickly become mere sounds, their etymology being buried, like so many of the earth’s marvels, beneath the dust of habit.
 - I am on Facebook, but mainly as a way to spy on my children. I find out more about them from their Facebook pages than from what they tell me.
 - When ‘Midnight’s Children’ came out, people in the West tended to respond to the fantasy elements in the novel, to praise it in those terms. In India, people read it like a history book.
 - It’s one thing to say, ‘I don’t like what you said to me and I find it rude and offensive,’ but the moment you threaten violence in return, you’ve taken it to another level, where you lose whatever credibility you had.
 - The whole story of migration and what that has done in interconnecting the planet is obviously something I’ve written about a lot.
 - What you were is forever who you are.
 - But love is what we want, not freedom. Who then is the unluckier man? The beloved, who is given his heart’s desire and must for ever after fear its loss, or the free man, with his unlooked-for liberty, naked and alone between the captive armies of the earth?
 - A book is not completed till it’s read.
 - What I’ve always seen in writers and artists is the courage it takes to make an original work of art. I think the real risks in literature are linguistic and intellectual, and I hope we can highlight those, as well as political courage.
 - I was very happy in Bombay. I was good at school. There was no reason to change anything. I suppose it must have been some spirit of adventure, of wanting to see the world.

 - My children are English, and both of their mothers were English.
 - The sixty-minute drama form has become very rich.
 - I always thought the front line was the bookstores. And bookstores around America, around the world did astonishingly well. They held the line. They didn’t chicken out. You know, they defended the book. They kept it in the front of the store.
 - I get a lot of letters – a lot of letters saying, who knew that you were funny?
 - I write books I’d enjoy reading, I’m the reader standing behind my shoulder.

 - Sometimes you find your voice by trying to write like people, and sometimes you find it by trying to write unlike people.
 - A poet’s work is to name the unnameable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world, and stop it going to sleep.
 - Mo Yan is the Chinese equivalent of the Soviet Russian apparatchik writer Mikhail Sholokhov: a patsy of the regime.
 - The problem’s name is God.
 - The glamour of being forbidden must not be underestimated.
 - I do think of Bombay as my hometown. Those are the streets I walked when I was learning to walk. And it’s the place that my imagination has returned to more than anywhere else.
 - The worst, most insidious effect of censorship is that, in the end, it can deaden the imagination of the people. Where there is no debate, it is hard to go on remembering, every day, that there is a suppressed side to every argument.
 - Not all possibilities are open to us. The world is finite; our hopes spill over its rim.
 - The only privilege literature deserves – and this privilege it requires in order to exist – is the privilege of being in the arena of discourse, the place where the struggle of our languages can be acted out.
 - If there were Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, it makes it certain there would be a reprisal attack against the United States at some point.
 - No story comes from nowhere; new stories are born from old.

 - If I had simply wanted to trade on an insult to Islam, I could have done it in a sentence rather than writing a 250,000-word novel, a work of fiction.
 - My grandmother was very fierce and gruff. She was quite small, but she was very wide.
 - The only way of living in a free society is to feel that you have the right to say and do stuff.
 - Reading is a very different thing than performing. In fact, one of the things I think that doesn’t work in books on tape is if the person doing the reading “acts” too much; it becomes irritating to you listening to it.
 - I think the book is less emotional than the film. With the film, the emotions are much more raw and in front. In the book, they are kind of ironized and seen through comedy.
 - Terror is glamour – not only, but also. I am firmly convinced that there’s something like a fascination with death among suicide bombers.
 - We all dream things into being; you imagine yourself having a child, and then you have a child. An inventor will think of something in his mind and then make it actual. So things are often passing from the imagined realm into the real world.
 - There is nothing intrinsic linking any religion with any act of violence. The crusades don’t prove that Christianity was violent. The Inquisition doesn’t prove that Christianity tortures people. But that Christianity did torture people.
 - Too many people had spent too long demonizing or totemizing me to listen seriously to what I had to say.
 - Realism can break a writer’s heart.

 - Many of us didn’t believe in the image of bin Laden as a wandering Old Man of the Mountains, living on plants and insects in an inhospitable cave somewhere on the porous Pakistan-Afghan border.
 - England in a way is lucky. It’s an island, so the frontiers are given by the sea.
 - Fundamentalism isn’t about religion, it’s about power.
 - I saw Quentin Tarantino’s ‘Django Unchained,’ and you could say a lot of things against it, but it was incredible fun. I don’t like blood and gore, and I am very squeamish about violence, but Tarantino’s violence is actually funny.
 - If somebody’s trying to shut you up, sing louder, and if possible, better.
 - I have always thought that these two ways of talking, one is the fantastic, the fable, the fairy tale, and the other being history, the scholarly study of what happened, I think they’re both amazing ways to understand human nature.

 - I think the veil is a way of taking power away from women.
 - Hell is other people’s fantasies...
 - Many men start being friendly with women because they are trying to seduce them. I’m not trying to seduce them. I just like hanging out with them.
 - Religion, a medieval form of unreason, when combined with modern weaponry becomes a real threat to our freedoms. This religious totalitarianism has caused a deadly mutation in the heart of Islam and we see the tragic consequences in Paris today.
 - It’s so disappointing, to put it mildly, that people know so much about my life. Because it means that they’re always trying to look at my books in terms of my life.
 - We crave permission openly to become our secret selves.
 - Only the foolish, blinded by language’s conventions, think of fire as red or gold. Fire is blue at it’s melancholy rim, green in it’s envious heart. It may burn white, or even, in it’s greatest rages, black.

 - There is no alternative to the peaceful coexistence of cultures.
 - I would argue that religion comes from a desire to get to the questions of, ‘Where do we come from?’ and ‘How shall we live?’ And I would say I don’t need religion to answer those questions.
 - I don’t think there is a need for an entity like God in my life.
 - Believe in your own eyes and you’ll get into a lot of trouble, hot water, a mess.
 - I’ll tell you what divorce hasn’t taught me. It didn’t teach me not to get married again.
 - Chekhov is this poet of melancholy and isolation and of wishing you were somewhere else than where you are.

 - In the movies, the writer is just the servant, the employee.

 - Few topographical boundaries can rival the frontiers of the mind.
