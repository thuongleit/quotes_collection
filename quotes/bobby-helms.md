 - You’re my special angel, sent from up above. The Lord smiled down on me, and sent an angel to love.
 - The smile on your lips brings the summer sunshine, the tears in your eyes bring the rain. I feel your touch, you warm embrace, and I’m in heaven again.
 - Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock. Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring. Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun. Now the jingle hop has begun.
