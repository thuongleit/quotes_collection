 - I am bored generally means “I am boring”.
 - Happiness is not so much a feeling as it is an attitude.

 - Compassion without wisdom is dangerous. It’s what enables people to support the ‘underdog,’ even if the underdog is evil.
 - Finding patterns is the essence of wisdom.
 - Complaining not only ruins everybody else’s day, it ruins the complainer’s day, too. The more we complain, the more unhappy we get.

 - Lies and victimhood make evil possible.
 - Complexity and profundity have been equated by the academic culture just as fame and significance have been conflated by the popular culture. Fame and significance have nothing to do with one another; and complexity and profundity have nothing to do with one another.

 - If you want to know what you look like, look into a mirror. If you want to know how you think, you should write.
 - The entire European Union is a left-wing dream.

 - Leftism and narcissism are almost synonymous.
 - Although images of perfection in people’s personal lives can cause unhappiness, images of perfect societies – utopian images – can cause monstrous evil. In fact, forcefully changing society to conform to societal images was the greatest cause of evil in the twentieth century.

 - I believe that free money is as addictive as cocaine.

 - Not only do we have a right to be happy, we have an obligation to be happy because our happiness has an effect on everyone around us.
 - You know what I ask Jewish liberals? ‘Why don’t you preach what you practice?’
 - Happiness is dependent on self-discipline. We are the biggest obstacles to our own happiness. It is much easier to do battle with society and with others than to fight our own nature.
 - Leftism hides under an intellectual veneer, but underneath it is all emotion.
 - Yet, while producing increasingly selfish people, the mantra of the Left, and therefore of the universities and the media, has been for generations that capitalism and the free market, not the welfare state, produces selfish people.

 - Chechnya is a pressure cooker of Islamist anger.
 - But if there is a just God, there is ultimate justice.

 - Lying to the Left is like water to fish.

 - I would bet that the average teenager in this country has not used the word ‘wisdom’ in the past year.

 - Whenever possible, the left and the Democrats have de-stigmatized irresponsible behavior.
 - Our scientific age demands that we provide definitions, measurements, and statistics in order to be taken seriously. Yet most of the important things in life cannot be precisely defined or measured. Can we define or measure love, beauty, friendship, or decency, for example?

 - Those who believe in nothing are very, very jealous and angry at those who believe in something.
 - I am convinced that great ideas that are powerfully presented can change a mind in five minutes.
 - In little more than a generation, feminism has obliterated roles. If you wonder why so many men choose not to get married, the answer lies in large part in the contemporary devaluation of the husband and of the father – of men as men, in other words.
 - There are surely times when a conservative and a liberal would agree. We would agree on how moral it is to discriminate on the basis of race. There’s absolutely no light between those two positions. It becomes a little more complex when you talk about law as opposed to morality.
 - Rather than dividing the world between good and evil, the Left divided the world in terms of economics. Economic classes, not moral values, explained human behavior. Therefore, to cite a common example, poverty, not one’s moral value system, or lack of it, caused crime.
 - For all of higher civilization’s recorded history, becoming a man was defined overwhelmingly as taking responsibility for a family.

 - All of the goodness in the world doesn’t amount to a hill of beans without courage.

 - The Left has always been anti-religious, and especially anti-Christian.
 - Without aging white males, I doubt the ‘New York Times’ would survive. How many young people, females, Hispanics and blacks subscribe to the ‘New York Times?’

 - God is the foundation of liberty. Because if God is not, who is? The government?
 - There’s more time spent on teaching kids about recycling than on character development in the American schools.

 - The Congressional Black Caucus is a moral fraud. It’s amazing how many people are afraid of saying that.
 - Without God and religion you don’t have moral truth, you have moral opinion.
 - If anything, we older people yearn for a peaceful world even more than young people do. We are the ones who lost friends or relatives in some war. We are the ones who have lived a lifetime of seeing and reading about human suffering.
 - How a society channels male aggression is one of the greatest questions as to whether that society will survive. That’s why I am not against violence in the media, I am against the glorification of immoral violence.
 - Most women are not programmed to prefer a great career to a great man and a family. They feel they were sold a bill of goods at college and by the media.
 - The greatest hope most Americans – including Republicans – had when Barack Obama was elected president was that the election of a black person as the country’s president would reduce, if not come close to eliminating, the racial tensions that have plagued America for generations.

 - Ever notice, the ones who deny the holocaust are usually the same ones who want to repeat it?

 - The Left corrupts everything it touches.
 - Since the 1970s, I have asked students if they would first try to save their drowning dog or a drowning stranger. And for 40 years I have received the same results: One third vote for their dog, one third for the stranger, and one third don’t know what they would do.
 - If the United States doesn’t lead then evil triumphs.
 - To deny that human beings are filled with anti-social passions betrays a denial of reality and a lack of self-awareness. One has to be taught nonsense for a great many formative years to believe it.

 - Liberals don’t ask ‘Does it work?’ They ask ‘Does it equalize?’
 - I am supposed to worry about oceans rising 70 years from now, on climate models that have already proven to be utterly flawed?

 - The essence of the Hebrew Bible, transmitted by Christianity, is separation: between life and death, nature and God, good and evil, man and woman, and the holy and the profane.
