 - Give me a child and I’ll shape him into anything.
 - Behavior is shaped and maintained by its consequences.
 - We shouldn’t teach great books; we should teach a love of reading. Knowing the contents of a few works of literature is a trivial achievement. Being inclined to go on reading is a great achievement.
 - A person who has been punished is not thereby simply less inclined to behave in a given way; at best, he learns how to avoid punishment.
 - If freedom is a requisite for human happiness, then all that’s necessary is to provide the illusion of freedom.
 - Do not intervene between a person and the consequences of their own behavior.

 - That’s all teaching is; arranging contingencies which bring changes in behavior.
 - The alphabet was a great invention, which enabled men to store and to learn with little effort what others had learned the hard way-that is, to learn from books rather than from direct, possibly painful, contact with the real world.
 - I did not direct my life. I didn’t design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That’s what life is.
 - An important fact about verbal behavior is that speaker and listener may reside within the same skin.
 - I will be dead in a few months. But it hasn’t given me the slightest anxiety or worry. I always knew I was going to die.

 - Science is a willingness to accept facts even when they are opposed to wishes.
 - Must we wait for selection to solve the problems of overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, pollution of the environment and a nuclear holocaust, or can we take explicit steps to make our future more secure? In the latter case, must we not transcend selection?
 - Twenty-five hundred years ago it might have been said that man understood himself as well as any other part of the world. Today he is the thing he understands least.
 - Some of us learn control, more or less by accident. The rest of us go all our lives not even understanding how it is possible, and blaming our failure on being born the wrong way.
 - A fourth-grade reader may be a sixth-grade mathematician. The grade is an administrative device which does violence to the nature of the developmental process.
 - The major difference between rats and people is that rats learn from experience.
 - The juvenile delinquent does not feel his disturbed personality. The intelligent man does not feel his intelligence or the introvert his introversion.
 - We have seen that in certain respects operant reinforcement resembles the natural selection of evolutionary theory. Just as genetic characteristics which arise as mutations are selected or discarded by their consequences, so novel forms of behavior are selected or discarded through reinforcement.
 - Many instructional arrangements seem “contrived,” but there is nothing wrong with that. It is the teacher’s function to contrive conditions under which students learn. It has always been the task of formal education to set up behavior which would prove useful or enjoyable later in a student’s life.
 - I’ve often said that my rats have taught me much more than I’ve taught them.
 - Unable to understand how or why the person we see behaves as he does, we attribute his behavior to a person we cannot see, whose behavior we cannot explain either but about whom we are not inclined to ask questions.
 - Society already possesses the psychological techniques needed to obtain universal observance of a code – a code which would guarantee the success of a community or state. The difficulty is that these techniques are in the hands of the wrong people-or, rather, there aren’t any right people.
 - Let men be happy, informed, skillful, well behaved, and productive.
 - No one asks how to motivate a baby. A baby naturally explores everything it can get at, unless restraining forces have already been at work. And this tendency doesn’t die out, it’s wiped out.
 - The simplest and most satisfactory view is that thought is simply behavior – verbal or nonverbal, covert or overt. It is not some mysterious process responsible for behavior but the very behavior itself in all the complexity of its controlling relations.
 - Does a poet create, originate, initiate the thing called a poem, or is his behavior merely the product of his genetic and environmental histories?
 - We admire people to the extent that we cannot explain what they do, and the word ‘admire’ then means ‘marvel at.’
 - The human species took a crucial step forward when its vocal musculature came under operant control in the production of speech sounds. Indeed, it is possible that all the distinctive achievements of the species can be traced to that one genetic change.
 - We do not choose survival as a value, it chooses us.
 - Old age is rather like another country. You will enjoy it more if you have prepared yourself before you go.
 - The world’s a poor standard. any society which is free of hunger and violence looks bright against that background.
 - A culture must be reasonably stable, but it must also change, and it will presumably be strongest if it can avoid excessive respect for tradition and fear of novelty on the one hand and excessively rapid change on the other.
 - A disappointment is not generally an oversight. It might just be the best one can do the situation being what it is. The genuine error is to quit attempting.
 - At this very moment enormous numbers of intelligent men and women of goodwill are trying to build a better world. But problems are born faster than they can be solved.
 - It is a surprising fact that those who object most violently to the manipulation of behaviour nevertheless make the most vigorous effort to manipulate minds.
 - The problem of far greater importance remains to be solved. Rather than build a world in which we shall all live well, we must stop building one in which it will be impossible to live at all.
 - The speaker does not feel the grammatical rules he is said to apply in composing sentences, and men spoke grammatically for thousands of years before anyone knew there were rules.
 - Science, not religion, has taught me my most useful values, among them intellectual honesty. It is better to go without answers than to accept those that merely resolve puzzlement.
 - The one fact that I would cry form every housetop is this: the Good Life is waiting for us – here and now.
