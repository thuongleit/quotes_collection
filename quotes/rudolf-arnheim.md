 - A good documentary or educational film is not raw experience. The material has passed the mill of reason, it has been sifted and interpreted.
 - Some popular quotations smell of airless closets. They exhale the stale imagination of the intellectual lower middle class. “Suspension of disbelief” has become one of them. Dressed up as a scintillating double negation, it serves the pedestrian notion of art as illusion.
 - Entropy theory, on the other hand, is not concerned with the probability of succession in a series of items but with the overall distribution of kinds of items in a given arrangement.
 - Good art theory must smell of the studio, although its language should differ from the household talk of painters and sculptors.

 - The least touchable object in the world is the eye.
 - A cloud can look like a camel, but a camel is unlikely to look like a cloud. This is so because the signifier must be able to stand for the whole category of the signified. The cloud looks like all camels, but no camel looks like all clouds.
 - Variety is more than a means of avoiding boredom, since art is more than an entertainment of the senses.
 - Form is sometimes considered a mere spice added by the artist to the representation of objects in order to make it pleasurable.

 - A revolution must aim at the destruction of the given order and will succeed only by asserting an order of its own.
 - Just as a chemist “isolates” a substance from contaminations that distort his view of its nature and effects, so the work of art purifies significant appearance. It presents abstract themes in their generality, but not reduced to diagrams.

 - The experienced physician, mechanic, or physiologist looking at a wound, an engine, a microscopic preparation, “sees” things the novice does not see. If both, experts and laymen, were asked to make exact copies of what they see, their drawings would be quite different.
 - Since mechanically obtained randomness contains all kinds of possible permutations, including the most regular ones, it cannot be relied upon always to exhibit a pervasive irregularity.
 - The clarification of visual forms and their organization in integrated patterns as well as the attribution of such forms to suitable objects is one of the most effective training grounds of the young mind.
 - In many instances, order is apprehended first of all by the senses.
 - The arts, as a reflection of human existence at its highest, have always and spontaneously lived up to this demand of plenitude. No mature style of art in any culture has ever been simple.
 - Entropy theory is indeed a first attempt to deal with global form; but it has not been dealing with structure. All it says is that a large sum of elements may have properties not found in a smaller sample of them.
