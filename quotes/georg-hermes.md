 - Death is like an arrow that is already in flight, and your life lasts only until it reaches you.
 - From one Soul of the Universe are all Souls derived.
 - A beautiful and chaste woman is the perfect workmanship of God, and the true glory of angels, the rare miracle of earth, and the sole wonder of the world.
 - The soul passeth from form to form; and the mansions of her pilgrimage are manifold.
 - Prayer is the chief thing that man may present unto God.
 - Not all human souls but only the pious ones are divine.
