 - You are the result of billions of years of evolution. You will only live for a few years and will never exist again. Absolutely beautiful.
 - That’s what life is, it’s the small struggles. You walk down the street for half an hour, you see half an hour of drama. You don’t need convoluted plot lines. You don’t need long-lost brothers. You don’t need it’s set on the future; it’s set on the moon.

 - A Christian telling an atheist they’re going to hell is as scary as a child telling an adult they’re not getting any presents from Santa.

 - I fought a bear once. But it started crying, so I let it off.

 - Hotel bars are pretty good. No one bothers me there. Restaurants are safe. People are quite respectful when you’re eating. But what I never do now is go to a busy bar on the weekend, or after 8 o’clock at night. That’s the danger zone. Also being trapped. Never go on the Metro, or a bus.

 - My ideal meal would probably be the cheesiest pasta or pizza, followed by something creamy and chocolaty. I mean, just the worst things, really.
 - I’m quite squeamish, really. I’m philistine and unsophisticated – not because of my great discerning palate but other reasons. Some are moral grounds, some texture.

 - I think Hollywood’s gotten more reactionary and conservative over the years, because there’s no longer art in Hollywood. Art suffers in Hollywood.
 - Comedy and drama are different sides of the same coin. And the thing about comedy and drama is about likability. It’s about character first. It’s about story. And for me, it’s about empathy, and I think the realer someone is, the further you can go either way with them.
