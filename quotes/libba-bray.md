 - Power changes everything till it is difficult to say who are the heroes and who the villains.
 - People have a habit of inventing fictions they will believe wholeheartedly in order to ignore the truth they cannot accept.
 - But we can’t go back. We can only go forward.
 - People think boundaries and borders build nations. Nonsense-words do. Beliefs, declarations, constitutions-words. Stories. Myths. Lies. Promises. History.
 - If you tell them what they want to hear, they don’t bother to try to see.
 - I changed the world; the world changed me. Everything you do comes back to you. When you affect a situation, you are also affected.
 - You can never really know someone completely. That’s why it’s the most terrifying thing in the world, really – taking someone on faith, hoping they’ll take you on faith too. It’s such a precarious balance, It’s a wonder we do it at all. And yet...
 - People always fear what they don’t understand, Evangeline. History proves that.
 - Everyone’s dying. A little, every day. Make it count.
 - Because you don’t notice the light without a bit of shadow. Everything has both dark and light. You have to play with it till you get it exactly right.
 - I’m a librarian, not an oracle.
 - How I’d love to get away from here and be someone else for a while in a place where no one knows or expects certain things from me.
 - Because ‘You’re perfect just the way you are,’ is what your guidance counselor says. And she’s an alcoholic.

 - In a world like this one, only the random makes sense.
 - Men have feelings too, you know. You bruise the petals of my manflower.

 - There is nothing more terrifying than the absoluteness of one who believes he’s right.
 - The world is only as fair as you can make it. Takes a lot of fight. A lot of fight. But if you stay in here, in your little cave, that’s one less fighter on the side of fair.
 - I know I’ve done the right thing but I couldn’t feel worse about it, and I suppose that is part of what it is to lead.
 - I run after her, not really giving chase. I’m running because I can, because I must. Because I want to see how far I can go before I have to stop.
 - The world expected girls to pluck and primp and put on heels. Meanwhile, boys dressed in rumpled T-shirts and baggy pants and misplace their combs, and yet you were suppose to fall at their feet? Unacceptable.
 - Will you punish me forever?
 - We all walk in a land of dreams. For what are we but atoms and hope, a handful of stardust and sinew? We are weary travelers trying to find our way home on a road that never ends. Am I a part of your dream? or are you but a part of mine?
 - There are no safe choices. Only other choices.
 - There’s a lot about discovering who you are and how difficult that is. And it never stops.
 - I should never be left alone with my mind for too long.
 - You’ve been assigned an identity since birth. Then you spend the rest of your life walking around in it to see if it really fits. You try on all these different selves and abandon just as many. But really it’s about dismantling all that false armor, getting down to what’s real. -Going Bovine.
 - You can never know about about your own destiny: are the people you meet there to play a part on your oun destiny, or do you exist just to play a role in theirs?

 - I don’t have time to feel sorry for myself. I’ve got to think.
 - I change the world, the world changes me.
 - What you want can be yours. But you must first know what it is you want.
 - Who but the mad would choose to keep on living? In the end, aren’t we all just a little crazy?
 - Or perhaps it is some combination of spirit and desire, love and hope, some alchemy that we each possess and can put to use, if we first know where to look without flinching.
 - I wish to live for myself. I should never want to be trapped.

 - So, now I’ve been to see a drug counselor who told me I need to lay off the drugs and talk about my feelings, and a shrink who heard what I had to say and immediately put me on drugs.
 - There’s a moment of profound sadness that can be dispelled only by summoning my anger.
 - The trouble with morning is that it comes well before noon.
 - What if evil doesn’t really exist? What if evil is something dreamed up by man, and there is nothing to struggle against except out own limitations? The constant battle between our will, our desires, and our choices?
 - How terrible it is to have no cares, no longings. I do not fit. I feel too deeply and want too much. As cages go, it is a gilded one, but I shall not live well in it or any cage for that matter.
 - We all do things we desperately wish we could undo. Those regrets just become part of who we are, along with everything else. To spend time trying to change that, well, it’s like chasing clouds.
 - Instead, I try to adjust to the dawn, letting the tears fall where they may, because it is morning; it is morning and there is so much to see.

 - Travel opens your mind as few other things do. It is its own form of hypnotism, and I am forever under its spell.
 - I’m sorry, Gemma. But we can’t live in the light all of the time. You have to take whatever light you can hold into the dark with you.
 - You set fire to my house, killed my family, and ate my dog. But steal my boyfriend? That’s a step too far.
 - Yes, go on. Leave. You’re always coming and going. The rest of us are stuck here. Do you think he’d still love you if he knew who you are? He doesn’t really care – only when it suits him.
 - I don’t think you should die until you’re ready. Until you’ve wrung out every last bit of living you can.
 - There is an ancient tribal proverb I once heard in India. It says that before we can see properly we must first shed our tears to clear the way.
 - She never utters a sound even when she’s crying, and that makes me a little sad. Doesn’t seem right. When you cry, people should hear you. The world should stop.

 - I love you for who you are, not who the world thinks you should be.
 - The uncertainty of our future is nothing more than a fog of breath on a windowpane.
 - The rules of magic, my dear, are best not discusses. For once we understand the illusion, we no longer believe it.
 - Clothing left on the bed unfolded. Books stained with coffee spots. Tabs not paid until the last possible second. Boys kissed and then forgotten in a week’s time.
 - I will tell you the story of how we found ourselves in a realm where dreams are formed, destiny is chosen, and magic is as real as a handprint in the snow.
 - To those who will see, the world waits.
 - It’s knowing I’ll never have what she has – a beauty so powerful it brings things to you. I fear I will always have to chase things I want. I’ll always have to wonder whether I’m truly wanted or whether I’ve just been settled for.
 - Who the heck is Don Quick-oats?
 - The night’s chilly breath tickles up my neck and finds my ear, whispering secrets only the wind knows.
 - We don’t look at each other anymore. Not really. Not since I pulled him from that opium den. Now when I look at him, I see the addict. And when he looks at me, he sees what he would rather not remember. I wish I could be his adored little girl again, sitting at his side.
 - The dull pain of truth weights my soul, pulling it under. I am left hopelessly awake.
 - Her eyes take on that suspicious, wounded look girls get when they know they’ve fallen off the top rung of friendship and someone else has passed them, but they don’t know when or how the change took place.
 - We’re comfortable with women in certain roles but not comfortable with women expressing anger or fully accepting their power. The most daring question a woman can ask is, ‘What do I want?’
 - I feel like I swallowed a Magritte. Like on the inside, I’m made of clouds and floating eyes, green apples, and slowly rising men in bowler hats.
 - When I dream, I dream of him. For several nights now he’s come to me, waving from a distant shore as if he’s been waiting patiently for me to arrive. He doesn’t utter a word, but his smile says everything: I’ve missed you.
 - Evie didn’t mind yelling, but she hated feeling judged. It got under her skin and made her feel small and ugly and unfixable.
 - The face staring back at me isn’t beautiful but she isn’t something that would scare the horses, either.
 - Feast for the Fisherman, the ultimate emo band. Said to be sold with a complimentary prescription for antidepressants and a free flatiron.
 - I’m an oddity of one, my strangeness too complicated to explain or share.
 - The man in the shop peered disapprovingly at Evie through the glass. She pumped her arms and legs up and down in imitation of a marching band, gave the man a salute, and continued her meandering walk to the museum.
 - When I dream, I dream of him.
 - A guy’s gotta live, you know, gotta make his way and find his meaning in life and love, and to do that he needs coffee, he needs coffee and coffee and coffee.

 - You are truly Satan’s sequined spawn.
 - It’s so laughable that it’s somewhere beyond comedy and right into tragedy again.
 - They would place their hands together inside the circle so that they could walk in each other’s dreams. It forged a bond that could not be broken. The circle represents love in eternity. For there is no beginning and no end.

 - I am dying a thousand cruel and unusual deaths as fifty pairs of eyes take me in, size me up like something that should be hanging over a fireplace in a gentleman’s den.
 - Our mouths and bodies speak for us in a new language as the trees shake loose a rain of petals that stick to our slickness like skins we will wear forever. And just like that, I am changed.
 - I’ve been poked and prodded in places I’d always prided myself on keeping untouched for that one special doctor who gives me a ring and a promise someday.
 - I’ve never been in love. I will die without knowing what it feels like to need to see one person’s face when you go to sleep at night, to crave seeing it when you wake up. I wish I knew.

 - Reason was for suckers and Presbyterians.
 - They don’t know what they’re in for at Spence, getting me, a ghost of a girl who’ll nod and smile and take her tea but who isn’t really here.

 - We are English, and I expect you to behave as such. No more crying.
 - Sheep. I’m stuck in a boarding school filled with sheep.
 - Jeez, someone needs to push the reset button on this planet.
 - Everyone seems to want more form me. I am a thoroughly disappointing girl around. I shall wear a scarlet ‘D’ upon my bosom for all to see so that they will know not to raise their expectations.
 - People will believe anything if it means they can go on with their lives and not have to think too hard about it.

 - No, I call. Come back. I’m here, he says. But I can’t see. It’s too bright. You can’t hold back the light, Gemma. I’m here. Trust me.
 - She loved attention. It was like a glass of the best champagne – bubbly and intoxicating – and as with champagne, she always wanted more of it. Still, she didn’t want to seem like an easy mark. “If you must know, I’ve come to join a convent,” Evie said, testing him.
 - Felicity and I watch the dancers moving as one. They spin about like the earth on it’s axis, enduring the dark, waiting for the sun.

 - They see her differently now, as somebody. And isn’t that what everyone wants? To be seen?
 - Around us the night creatures have their say. We are surrounded by a symphony of crickets and frogs. Neither of us feels the need to speak, and I suppose that is one of the qualities I find comforting in Kartik. We can be alone together.
 - Will was making a speech, something about having been young and careless once, the sort of thing old-timers said when they issued a deathblow, as if they thought their sanctimonious ramblings disguised as empathy would be welcomed, but Evie was only half listening.
 - Things aren’t good or bad in and of themselves. It’s what we do with them that makes them so.
 - There is a dualism inherent in democracy – opposing forces pushing against each other, always. Culture clashes. Different belief systems. All coming together to create this country. But this balance takes a great deal of energy.

 - Please do not strain yourself, Miss Doyle. I won’t have my girls going cross-eyed in the name of art.
 - I thought research would be more glamorous, somehow. I’d give the librarian a secret code word and he’d give me the one book I needed and whisper the necessary page numbers. Like a speakeasy. With books.

 - Without further warning, the sky opens up and cries.
 - Life don’t come to you, Memphis. You gotta take it. We have to take it. Because ain’t nobody handing it to us.

 - When you looked up to the sky and cried ‘Why?’ sometimes the sky shrugged, yet other times it answered with warm assurance of linked hands.

 - She’s no beauty, mate.

 - My misery is reaching epidemic proportions.
 - One could argue that it’s romantic to die for love. Of course, then you’re dead and unable to take that honeymoon trip to the Alps with all the other fashionable young couples, which is a shame.
 - With each shimmy, the bugle beads on their scandalously revealing costumes swung and shook. It was the sort of display Evie knew her mother would have found appalling – an example of the moral decay of the young generation. It was sexual and dangerous and thrilling, and Evie wanted more of it.
 - May I suggest that you all read? And often. Believe me, it’s nice to have something to talk about other than the weather and the Queen’s health. Your mind is not a cage. It’s a garden. And it requires cultivating.

 - You’ve influenced the world not because you wanted to hug it and cuddle it and call it sweet thing, but because one day you wanted to beat the crap out of somebody but you didn’t. You made a painting instead.
 - For once, Evie didn’t know what to say. She hadn’t really thought of her uncle as very human. He was more like a textbook who occasionally remembered to put on a tie. But it was clear that he was, indeed, human, with a deep wound named Rotke.

 - I know because I read. Might I suggest you try it?
 - It occurs to me that cricket is not the true sport in London – gossip is.

 - It isn’t that we do what we want. It’s that we’re allowed to want at all.
 - But sons are a different matter to a man. More a duty than an indulgence.
 - Just once, she’d like to be the exciting one, the girl somebody wanted.
 - We’re each of us our own chiaroscuro, our own bit of illusion trying to emerge into something solid, something real. We’ve got to forgive ourselves that. I must remember to forgive myself. Because there’s an awful lot of gray to work with. No one can live in the light all the time.

 - Ain’t that a sight? With all the things we know and learn, we still ain’t touched the big mysteries – where we come from, where we go next, why we even her. And when something truly miraculous happens, we run and hide in our caves. We deny.
 - I hate high heels. Walking in high heels for eight hours a day should be forbidden by the Geneva Convention.
 - Can we really conquer chaos so easily? If that were so, I should be able to prune the pandemonium of my own soul into something neat and tidy rather than this maze of wants and needs and misgivings that has me forever feeling as if I cannot fit into the landscape of things.

 - What do you feel? I’ve never been asked this question once. None of us has. We aren’t supposed to feel. We’re British.
 - I am a jumble of passions, misgivings, and wants. It seems that I am always in a state of wishing and rarely in a state of contentment.
 - I’ve never done acid, finding it hard to go willingly to a place that could be frightening, hellish, and totally beyond my control. A place much like high school.
