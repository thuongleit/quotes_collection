 - Where your pain is, there your heart lies also.
 - This morning I suddenly catch myself: I’m not there, I’m so lost in thought, I don’t know what’s going on around me. Can you think yourself to death?
 - We cling to words like drowning men to straws. But still we drown, we drown.
 - I’ve learned to value failed conversations, missed connections, confusions. What remains is what’s unsaid, what’s underneath. Understanding on another level of being.
 - I have no talent. I write poems for myself, to think things through, that’s all.
 - Even a painful longing is some form of presence.
 - My poems are more my silence than my speech. Just as music is a kind of quiet. Sounds are needed only to unveil the various layers of silence.
 - I don’t write poetry when I wish, I write when I can’t, when my larynx is flooded and my throat is shut.
 - Tell me what’s the difference.
 - Poetry is a presentiment of the truth.
 - Letters of the condemned. Last words scratched on a cell’s wall. To write like that.
 - I write in order to comprehend, not to express myself.
 - I am that which lies beyond time. Like a melody, which sounds completely only after the last note is played.
 - I’m moved by everything broken and crippled. Since that’s how we really are.
 - The way a source strains toward the light, toward the air. Its laboring work, its effort, its black passageways like despair. That’s the way a poet looks for words. With muscles, gestures.
