 - Holy Saturday. The best reminder that the silence of God doesn’t equal the absence of God.
 - Jesus plus nothing equals everything; everything minus Jesus equals nothing.
 - Grace is love that seeks you out when you have nothing to give in return. Grace is love coming at you that has nothing to do with you. Grace is being loved when you are unlovable...
 - God loves broken people because broken people are all that there are.
 - Grace is unconditional acceptance given to an undeserving person by an unobligated giver.
 - To progress is always to begin again.
 - Walking with God doesn’t lead to God’s favor; God’s favor leads to walking with God.
 - The deepest cry of the human heart is to be loved without condition, no matter what. The gospel of grace announces that you are.
 - Here’s one way I can know that I’ve forgotten the gospel of grace: when your sin bothers me more than my sin.
 - Legalism says God will love us if we change. The gospel says God will change us because He loves us.
 - Grace always runs downhill, meeting us at the bottom, not the top.
 - The gospel is not about a lifestyle that we live, it’s about the law-fulfilling life that Christ lived.
 - Sometimes God has to remind you that you’re weak so that you can be set free from your “self-sufficiency.”
 - The Gospel announces that Jesus came to acquit the guilty. He came to judge and be judged in our place. Christ came to satisfy the deep judgment against us once and for all so that we could be free from the judgement of God, others, and ourselves.
 - We are broken people living in a broken world with other broken people. We all need grace.
 - Your identity is firmly anchored in Christ’s accomplishment, not yours; his strength, not yours; his performance, not yours; his victory, not yours.
 - God’s capacity to forgive is greater than our capacity to sin; while our sin reaches far, God’s grace reaches farther. It’s a message revealing the radical contrast between the sinful heart of mankind and the gracious heart of mankind’s Creator.
 - There are a still lot of people in today’s church who can easily identify the idolatry outside the church and are pretty proud of the fact that they are not like them. And yet, we are far too slow to recognize the idolatry inside the church and more painfully, the idolatry inside our hearts.
 - God’s ability to clean things up is infinitely greater than our ability to mess things up.
 - If we’re not reaching the same people Jesus reached, then we’re not preaching the same message Jesus preached.
 - Christianity is not “Jesus is our example.” Christianity is “Jesus is our substitute.”
 - A biblical understanding of the Christian life is not ‘let go and let God,’ it’s ‘trust God and get going.’
 - Spiritual growth is marked by a growing realization of just how much grace you need.
 - Our deepest fear is judgment. Our deepest longing is love. The gospel of grace removes the one and provides the other.
 - Long-term, gospel-motivate d obedience can only come from the grace of what Jesus has already done, not the guilt of what we must do.
 - Performancism is the mindset that equates our identity and value directly with our performance and accomplishments.
 - In ‘Surprised by Grace: God’s Relentless Pursuit of Rebels,’ I retell the story of Jonah and show how Jonah was just as much in need of God’s grace as the sailors and the Ninevites.
 - I didn’t realize that I was in a self-made prison of human approval and human acceptance. Didn’t even realize it. Most of the prisons we live in we are not conscious of.
 - Legalism breeds a sense of entitlement that turns us into complainers.
 - The truth, whether we admit it or not, is that grace scares us to death. It scares us primarily because it wrestles control and manageability out of our hands – introducing chaos and freedom.
 - God is inviting you today to appropriately grieve your pains and losses and to acknowledge the world is seriously broken.
 - There is no better news than that the God who makes the demand for perfection also meets the demand for perfection on our behalf.
 - If you have suffered the loss of a family member to chronic disease, if you suffer debilitating seasons of depression, if you have lost your job and livelihood, gone through a divorce that came out of the blue, know that God is not punishing you. He is not waiting for you to do something.
 - When you don’t have anything to lose, you discover something wonderful: you’re free to take great risks without fear or reservation.
 - While our sin reaches far, God’s grace reaches farther. God came after us not to strip away our freedom but to strip away our slavery to self, that we could become truly free.
 - I never had an intellectual struggle with the Bible, with the gospel, with the claims of Christ.
 - I was spending way too much time thinking about me and what I needed to do, and far too little time thinking about Jesus and what he had already done for me.
 - The law demands that we do it all; the gospel declares that Jesus paid it all.
 - Only the Holy Spirit can comfort a person in the depths of grief.
 - Because of Jesus the sin we cannot forget God does not remember.
 - For the life of the believer, one thing is beautifully and abundantly true: God’s chief concern in your suffering is to be with you and be himself for you.
 - Grace is upside-down, to-do-list wrecking, scandalous and way-too free. It’s one-way love.
 - When you fail to distinguish Law and Gospel, you lose both.
 - In those moments when I’m obsessively counting my sins against me, it is good news to remember that God has counted my sins against Christ.
 - Grace is the most dangerous, expectation-wre cking, smile-creating, counterintuitiv e reality there is.
 - We are all both victims and victimizers. Just as everyone suffers, no one is innocent of causing suffering themselves.
 - Jesus has done everything for you.
 - Grace flows most refreshingly through the faucet of brokenness.
 - The gospel doesn’t just free me from what people think of me, but also from what I think of me.
 - If we read the Bible asking first, ‘What would Jesus do?’ instead of asking ‘What has Jesus done?’ we’ll miss the good news that alone can set us free.
 - Whether it’s a Christian or a non-Christian, there’s nothing like suffering to show us how small, needy, and not in control we are. Suffering has a way of sobering us up to the realization that we can’t make it on our own, that we need help, that we’re broken.
 - Our assurance is anchored in the love and grace of God expressed in the glorious exchange: our sin for His righteousness.
 - The emphasis of the Bible is on the work of the Redeemer, not on the work of the redeemed.
 - My struggle isn’t believing my performance can earn God’s favor; my struggle is believing my performance can keep God’s favor.
 - Self-righteousness is the fruit of a low view of God’s law and a lite view of your own sin.
 - People who haven’t experienced major setbacks sometimes feel that their hurts are somehow less legitimate or real.
 - God does everything through people who understand they’re nothing. And God does nothing through those who think they’re everything.
 - Passive righteousness tells us that God does not need our good works. Active righteousness tells us that our neighbor does. The aim and direction of good works are horizontal, not vertical.
 - The best evangelists, the best preachers, the best teachers are desperate people.
 - If people knew the REAL us, they would run. God knows, stays, and loves.
 - I think for far too long the Church has concluded that Christians don’t need the gospel, it’s simple what non-Christian people need in order to be saved.
 - The desperate addict is closer to the heart of grace than the devout moralist.
 - It’s better to feel sorry for doing something bad than to feel superior for doing something good.
 - My job is not to show my children that I’m the man, but to show them that Christ is the man.
 - My daily sins require daily distribution of God’s grace. In that sense, it never ceases to surprise me because I don’t deserve any of it. I mean, I deserve to be locked in a cage and for God to throw away the key.
 - The passive righteousness of faith frees me from passing final judgment on myself.
 - Don’t get me wrong – what we do is important. But it is infinitely less important than what Jesus has done for us.
 - The gospel is for the defeated, not the dominant.
 - The gospel doesn’t just ignite the Christian life but it keeps Christians growing and growing every day. There’s no reason to move beyond the gospel. There’s only movement more into it.
 - Being the middle child, I couldn’t figure out where I fit in the home. I couldn’t figure out whether I was the youngest of the older three or the oldest of the younger three.
 - The heart of the Christian faith is Good News, not good advice, good technique, or good behavior.
 - God’s grace is so counterintuitive and everything we do in our life is just based on conditions. You do this for me and I’ll do that for you. Or if you don’t do this for me, I won’t do that for you. And God’s grace works in a completely different direction.
 - I ended up dropping out of high school at 16 and getting kicked out of my home. My parents told me, sadly, that because I was so disruptive to the rest of the household, that I could no longer live under their roof.
 - Every time we sin in thought, word, or deed, we’re essentially saying in that moment that, “I don’t need you God. I don’t want you God. I like my way better than your way.”
 - Real, pure, unadulterated freedom happens when the resources of the gospel smash any sense of need to secure for myself anything beyond what Christ has already secured for me.
 - I became frustrated with myself for not being as sturdy and unquestioning as I knew a man in my position should be.
 - Christmas is the beachhead of God’s campaign against sin and sadness, darkness and death, fear and frustration.
 - There’s absolutely no way you can feel the freedom to embarrass and humiliate yourself unless you have finally recognized that your identity is in someone other than yourself.
 - Christianity is not about good people getting better. It is good news for bad people coping with their failure to be good.
 - Because the church has moved away from the gospel anytime you move away from the gospel, you at the same time move toward pretense, you move toward image-keeping, you move toward the need to pretend.
 - The Bible makes it clear that self-righteousness is the premier enemy of the Gospel.
 - The ironic thing about legalism is that it not only doesn’t make people work harder, it makes them give up. Moralism doesn’t produce morality; rather, it produces immorality.
 - The lifeblood of Christianity is not our persistence in moving toward God but God’s persistence in moving toward us.
 - Between writing, traveling, speaking, preaching, and doing my best to be a good husband to my wife and my three kids, that’s about as much as one man or at least this man can do.
 - Contrary to popular assumptions, the Bible is not a record of the blessed good, but rather the blessed bad. Thats not a typo. The Bible is a record of the blessed bad. The Bible is not a witness to the best people making it up to God; its a witness to God making it down to the worst people.
 - When Martin Luther was asked what we contribute to our salvation, he said, “Sin and resistance”
 - There’s nothing like suffering to reveal how small and needy you are. Pain has the remarkable capacity to reveal the weakness of the things you’re leaning on to make life worth living.
 - The truth is, narratives of self-justification burble beneath more of our relationships and endeavors than we would care to admit.
 - God’s acceptance of us cannot be gained by our successes nor forfeited by our failures.
 - My lifestyle got so disruptive to my family that my parents had no choice but to say, “You can’t live here any longer if you’re going to live this way.” So, I was thrilled about it – thrilled!
 - The gospel doesn’t make bad people good, it makes dead people alive.
 - There is no better story in the Old Testament, or perhaps the whole Bible, for depicting the difference between the ladder-defined life and the cross-defined life than that of the Tower of Babel.
 - When God saved me, He gave me a thirst to learn and to read and to study. I thrived in college. I got a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and then went to Reformed Theological Seminary in Orlando.
 - The law is God’s first word; the gospel is God’s final word.
 - What is indisputable is the fact that unbelief is the force that gives birth to all of our bad behavior and every moral failure. It is the root.
 - Rest assured: Before God, the righteousness of Christ is all we need; before God, the righteousness of Christ is all we have.
 - My observation of Christendom is that most of us tend to base our relationship with God on our performance instead of on His grace.
 - The only thing that frees you from the need to pretend in order to make people believe you are something when you are actually not is the gospel because the gospel tells you that identity, my meaning, my security, and all of those things are in Christ.
 - My job as a pastor and theologian is to tease out the nature and the necessity of the gospel in meticulous ways, in everything I say, in everything I like. I want desperately for the church in America to rediscover the power and the beauty and the nature and the necessity of the gospel.
 - Christianity is in no way a stoic faith. It fundamentally rejects the “stiff upper lip” school of thought.
 - Disobedience happens not when we think too much grace but when we think too little of it.
 - What kind of person should you be to someone who has fallen? The kind of person you will run to when you fall.
 - If you feel compelled to respond every time you’re criticized it reveals just how much you’ve built your identity on being right.
 - When I was 25, I believed I could change the world. At 41, I have come to the realization that I cannot change my wife, my church, or my kids, to say nothing of the world. Try as I might, I have not been able to manufacture outcomes the way I thought I could, either in my own life or other people’s.
 - Nothing makes me want to obey more than knowing that God unconditionally loves me and forgives me even when I disobey.
 - The way of God’s grace becomes indispensable when we realize that the way of God’s law is inflexible.
 - Even those of us who have tasted the radical saving grace of God find it intuitively difficult not to put conditions on grace.
 - The good news of suffering is that it brings us to the end of ourselves – a purpose it has certainly served in my life. It brings us to the place of honesty, which is the place of desperation, which is the place of faith, which is the place of freedom.
 - The people who tend to be the most gracious are those who know how badly they need grace.
 - A preacher who doesn’t believe he’s that bad will attract people who don’t think they’re that bad. And that’s bad.
 - To focus on how I’m doing more than what Christ has done is Christian narcissism.
 - When the Christian faith becomes defined by who we are and what we do and not by who Christ is and what he did for us, we miss the gospel – and we, ironically, become more disobedient.
 - Moralism doesn’t produce morality; it produces immorality.
 - God is not interested in what you think you should be or feel. He is not interested in the narrative you have constructed for yourself, or that others have constructed for you – even the one that your church has constructed for you.
 - Death is the operative device that sets us free in Christ – when we die, we truly live.

 - Job’s unraveling wasn’t wrong or sinful; rather, it was emotionally realistic.
 - We often read the Bible as if it were fundamentally about us: our improvement, our life, our triumph, our victory, our faith, our holiness, our godliness.
 - When we imply that our works are for God and not our neighbor, we perpetuate the idea that God’s love for us is dependent on what we do instead of on what Christ has done.
 - Since Genesis 3 we have been addicted to setting our sights on something, someone, smaller than Jesus.
 - The world isn’t scandalized by our freedom but by our fakeness.
 - Once God saves us He doesn’t move us beyond the gospel, but He moves us more deeply into the gospel.
 - The grace of God sets us free from a life of perfection, performing, and pretending.
 - Our default faith mode is to trust, above all things, our own ability to create a safe, controllable, predictable world.
 - The focus of the Christian faith is not our morality; it is Jesus, who died for our immorality.
 - To be Biblically balanced is to let our theology and preaching be proportioned by the Bible’s radically disproportionate focus on God’s saving love for sinners seen and accomplished in the crucified and risen Christ.
 - Remember on your best day that Jesus had to die for you. Remember on your worst day that he did.
 - When you don’t know where you fit inside the home and you’re young and you’re desperate to fit in somewhere, I’d figured where I would fit outside the home. So I made some obviously bad decisions about who I hung out with and the things that I did.

 - Only when you realize that the gospel has nothing to do with your obedience but with Christ’s obedience for you, will you start to obey. The only Christians who end up getting better are those who realize that if they don’t get better, God will love them anyway.

 - I actually think one of most profoundly and deep pastoral moments between a pastor and his church is what happens between them before God in the context of preaching.
 - Contrary to what we conclude naturally, the gospel is not too good to be true. It is true! Its the truest truth in the entire universe. No strings attached! No fine print to read. No buts. No conditions. No qualifications. No footnotes. And especially, no need for balance.
 - The overwhelming emphasis of contemporary Christianity: “Just do it.” The overwhelming emphasis of Biblical Christianity: “It is finished”
 - The smaller you get-the smaller life makes you-the easier it is to see the grandeur of grace. While I am far more incapable than I may have initially thought, God is infinitely more capable than I ever hoped.
 - Your pain could be God prying open your life and heart to remove a gift of His that you’ve been on to more dearly than Him.
 - The truth is that when it comes to suffering, if we do not go to our graves in confusion, we will not go to our graves trusting. Explanations are a substitute for trust.
 - Whatever we may mean by ‘Christian growth,’ it is ultimately this: less faith in me, more faith in God.

 - The gospel frees you from the pressure of having to fix people: your worth is located in Christ, not in their transformation.

 - Christian growth doesn’t happen by first behaving better, but by believing better – believi ng in bigger, deeper, brighter ways what Christ has already secured for sinners.

 - The gospel is good news to those who know they don’t measure up. It’s offensive to those who think they do.
 - The gospel sets us free to become the romantic leaders of our marriages without fright or hesitation. Because we have been forever wooed by Jesus, we are now free to forever woo our wives.
