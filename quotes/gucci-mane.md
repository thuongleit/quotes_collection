 - Ain’t got no comparison and I ain’t being arrogant.
 - How you dress on the outside, it represents your soul.
 - A lot of times when you keep it real with somebody, you can’t expect them to keep it real with you. In this industry people just want to be famous and they forget how to keep it real and they forget to give credit to the people who helped them get to where they at.
