 - You think you’re lost but you’re not lost on your own. You’re not alone. I will stand by you, I will help you through when you’ve done all you can do. If you can’t cope, I will dry your eyes I will fight your fight, I will hold you tight and I wont let go.
 - I hope you never look back but you never forget, all the ones who loved you and the place you left.
 - Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time Here comes the start of every sleepless night The first of every tear Im gonna cry Here comes the pain, Here comes me wishing things had never changed And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye.
 - I’ve been burdened with blame trapped in the past for too long, I’m moving on.
 - I wake up and tear drops, they fall down like rain. I put on that old song we danced to and then, I head off to my job cause not much has changed. Punch the clock, head for home, check the phone. Just in case. Go to bed, dream of you. That’s what I am doing these days.
 - Life’s like a novel with the end ripped out.
