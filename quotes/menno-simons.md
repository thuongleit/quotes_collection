 - I can neither teach nor live by the faith of others. I must live by my own faith as the Spirit of the Lord has taught me through His Word.
 - Lord of hosts! When I swim in the merciful waters of your grace I find that I can neither plumb nor measure the depths.
 - True evangelical faith, cannot lie dormant, it clothes the naked, it feeds the hungry, it comforts the sorrowful, it shelters the destitute, it serves those that harm it, it binds up that which is wounded, it has become all things to all creatures.
 - The regenerated do not go to war, nor engage in strife. They are children of peace who have beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning forks, and know no war.
