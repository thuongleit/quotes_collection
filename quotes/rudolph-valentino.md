 - Don’t worry chief, it will be alright.
 - To generalize on women is dangerous. To specialize in them is infinitely worse.
 - Don’t pull down the blinds. I feel fine. I want the sunlight to greet me!

 - If ever I were to have a symbol attributed to me, it would be a heart, the outline!
 - I am begining to look more and more like my miserable imitators.
