 - Life is not the mountaintops, it’s the walking in between.
 - I never knew that I could love someone the way that I love you.
 - I have learned that you’re not perfect, and that sometimes the one you love can burn you. But it’s just the fool that’s looking backwards: a bitter heart turns the love we made to ashes.
 - I would say that I’m happy getting to make a living playing music and seeing people enjoy music that I make. So far, things have grown consistently and quicker than I thought they would, so that could possibly continue. Even if it ended tomorrow, I’d be really grateful that I got to do it.
 - Most people who work with me can tell you I’m a bit of a pessimist about business stuff. Not because I don’t believe in what I’m doing, I just don’t like feeling presumptuous. Like, ‘This is what’s going to happen!’ Honestly, I don’t know what will happen.
 - Recording can be enjoyable, but the hard thing is that you don’t get any direct or immediate feedback like you do when you play live. Getting to see people’s excitement and see them engage in the show makes me excited to get back out and play.
 - It’s crazy to think of myself as a musician. It’s ridiculous that I get to do it, and I don’t necessarily mean music. Getting to do something you really enjoy as a job is an incredible privilege, I think. I still don’t really feel like a musician outside of the actual music.
