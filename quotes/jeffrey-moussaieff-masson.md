 - Animals are, like us, endangered species on an endangered planet, and we are the ones who are endangering them, it, and ourselves. They are innocent sufferers in a hell of our making.
 - Dogs never lie about love.
 - We need cats to need us. It unnerves us that they do not. However, if they do not need us, they nonetheless seem to love us.
 - Perhaps one central reason for loving dogs is that they take us away from this obsession with ourselves. When our thoughts start to go in circles, and we seem unable to break away, wondering what horrible event the future holds for us, the dog opens a window into the delight of the moment.
 - Questers of the truth, that’s who dogs are; seekers after the invisible scent of another being’s authentic core.
 - The curiosity of cats is, like their affection, of a purity and intensity rarely seen in humans. We would be jaded when faced with the fiftieth paper bag. Not so our cats.
 - Hardly any animal can look as deeply disappointed as a dog to whom one says “no.”
