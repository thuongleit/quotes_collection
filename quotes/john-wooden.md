 - Losing does not make you a failure; it is when you blame someone for losing when you become a failure.

 - Your energy and enjoyment, drive and dedication will stimulate and greatly inspire others.

 - I found the bench to be the greatest ally when I had to make individuals comply with what was best for the team.

 - You can lose when you outscore somebody in a game, and you can win when you’re outscored.
 - Many leaders don’t listen, and it is one of the greatest methods we have of learning. You need to listen to those under your supervision and to those who are above you.
