 - I know I am dying, but my deathbed is a bed of roses. I have no thorns planted upon my dying pillow. Heaven is already begun!
 - Architecture isn’t just about creating new buildings, sometimes its about retuning what’s already there...
 - It was never just about painting everything white, I set out to create comfortable spaces – visually comfortable spaces. My mind always feels a little scrambled, so being in simple rooms helps me to think straight.
 - The spirit of my home is entirely bound up in a quality of space. I have only the objects I need and nothing more. Empty space in which to think and relax is both stimulating and calming.
