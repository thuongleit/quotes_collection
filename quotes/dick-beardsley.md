 - When you cross the finish line, it will change your life forever.
 - I went at each race like there was a gold medal at stake. It wasn’t like I ran one hard, then slacked off the next. Every time was my best effort. I didn’t know how to go at it any other way.
 - A lot of people say they love running because of how they feel afterward. Not me. Well, I love that, too, but it’s also so much fun while I’m out there.
