 - I don’t know anything about luck, but that the harder I train, the luckier I get.
 - I ski to win. When the day comes that I can’t get myself into a fighting mood anymore, I won’t be able to win and I’ll stop racing.
 - To win, I have to get angry. My anger is directed at the course, at attacking it and beating it.
