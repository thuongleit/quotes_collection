 - It is no common mortal who speaks to us in this music.
 - Someday I will have to give an account of myself. How would the Father in Heaven judge me if I followed others and not Him?
 - They want me to write differently. Certainly I could, but I must not. God has chosen me from thousands and given me, of all people, this talent. It is to Him that I must give account. How then would I stand there before Almighty God, if I followed the others and not Him?
