 - Our self image, strongly held, essentially determines what we become.

 - Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a ‘real’ experience. In either case, it reacts automatically to information which you give to it from your forebrain. Your nervous system reacts appropriately to what you THINK or IMAGINE to be ’true.

 - Happiness is native to the human mind and its physical machine. We think better, perform better, feel better, and are healthier when we are happy.

 - Your nervous system cannot tell the difference between an imagined experience and a ‘real’ experience.
 - Life is a series of problems.

 - Your automatic guidance system cannot guide you when you’re standing still.

 - Get into the habit of laughing; too many of us have forgotten how to laugh. As people grow older, they sometimes forget that they ever laughed. It is a part of their childhood that they can no longer remember.
