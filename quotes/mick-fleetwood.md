 - Rock and roll is commitment. Rock and roll is passion and spirit.
 - If you were to ask me, ‘What the hell does a musician have in common with a restaurant?’ I would say a huge amount. It’s show time every day, it’s a team of people, like, running a circus, which is running a rock-and-roll band.
 - The down side these days is thinking that, “I can do this all on my own”. Yes, you can do this on your own but you’ll be a much happier human being if you do it with other human beings.
 - Fleetwood Mac has been pretty truthful. Open about what we do. We’ve always done it from the inside out. Versus being pressured from the outside and changing the inside. And that’s our story.
 - Fleetwood Mac were really accessible musically, but lyrically and emotionally, we weren’t so easy. And it was our music that helped us survive. But all of us were in pieces personally.
 - My template for most songs is ‘Is this inspiring?’ and with the blues it so often is.
 - The value of friends has always been a natural thing. I prefer too many to too few.

 - We’re all looking for those moments – a relief. That’s why people go out and treat themselves.
 - In order to run a great business, you must know that a bunch of really intrinsically unhappy people, that’s not a recipe for success. Don’t be anywhere you don’t need to be; it’s just like that.
 - No matter what – rehearsed, under-rehearsed, over-rehearsed, doubts about rehearsing – the first gig is always the first gig, and you put on your little praying hat, batten down the hatch, and do what you do.
 - To me, the blues is an infection. I don’t think it’s necessarily a melancholy thing; the blues can be really positive and I think I think anyone and everyone can have a place for the blues. It need not always a woeful, sorrowful thing. It’s more reflective; it reminds you to feel.
 - Life is a glass of wine and having your feet washed – it’s a biblical event, might I add. This is part of mankind’s story. You are always looking for a moment to take a break.
