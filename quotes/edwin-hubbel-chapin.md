 - Never does the human soul appear so strong as when it foregoes revenge and dares to forgive an injury.
 - No language can express the power and beauty and heroism of a mother’s love.
 - Our life is what we make it. An insignificant game or a noble trial; a dream or a reality; a play of the senses worn out in selfish use, and flying “swifter than a weaver’s shuttle,” or an ascension of the soul, by daily duties and unfaltering faith, to more spiritual relations and to loftier toils.

 - Truth is poetry; it is the grandest poetry.

 - Mercy. That is the gospel. The whole of it in one word.
 - Consider and act with reference to the true ends of existence. This world is but the vestibule of an immortal life. Every action of our lives touches on some chord that will vibrate in eternity.

 - There is no happiness in life, there is no misery, like that growing out of the dispositions which consecrate or desecrate a home.

 - Death is a great revealer of what is in a man, and in its solemn shadow appear the naked lineaments of the soul.

 - There must be something beyond man in this world. Even on attaining to his highest possibilities, he is like a bird beating against his cage. There is something beyond, O deathless like a sea-shell, moaning for the bosom of the ocean to which you belong!
 - Munificent nature follows the methods of the divine and true, and rounds all things to her perfect law. While nations are convulsed with blood and violence, how quietly the grass grows.
 - The deepest life of nature is silent and obscure; so often the elements that move and mould society are the results of the sister’s counsel and the mother’s prayer.
 - The city reveals the moral ends of being, and sets the awful problem of life. The country soothes us, refreshes us, lifts us up with religious suggestion.

 - Do not ask if a man has been through college; ask if a college has been through him; if he is a walking university.
 - Ostentation is the signal flag of hypocrisy.

 - In some way the secret vice exhales its poison; and the evil passion, however cunningly masked, stains through to the surface.

 - Humility is not a weak and timid quality; it must be carefully distinguished from a groveling spirit.
 - Life is a problem. Not merely a premiss from which we start, but a goal towards which we proceed. It is an opportunity for us not merely to get, but to attain; not simply to have, but to be. Its standard of failure or success is not outward fortune, but inward possession.
 - Many a man who might walk over burning ploughshares into heaven stumbles from the path because there is gravel in his shoes.
 - Character has more effect than anything else. Let a number of loud-talking men take up a particular question, and one man of character, of known integrity and beauty of soul, will outweigh them all in his influence.
 - We may learn by practice such things upon earth as shall be of use to us in heaven. Piety, unostentatious piety, is never out of place.
 - The sluices of the grog-shop are fed from the wine-glasses in the parlor, and there is a lineal descent from the gentleman who hiccoughs at his elegant dinner-table to the sot who makes a bed of the gutter.
 - It is not enjoined upon us to forget, but we are told to forgive, our enemies.

 - No piled-up wealth, no social station, no throne, reaches as high as that spiritual plane upon which every human being stands by virtue of his humanity.
 - The productions of the press, fast as steam can make and carry them, go abroad through all the land, silent as snowflakes, but potent as thunder. It is an additional tongue of steam and lightning, by which a man speaks his first thought, his instant argument or grievance, to millions in a day.
 - Nature satisfies my thirst; it feeds my hunger; it finds me clothing; it affords me shelter; it wraps me around when I sleep with beneficent and watchful care; and it takes me at last to its great bosom, where my ashes mingle with their kindred dust.

 - A life is black, whiten it as you will.
 - Revolution does not insure progress. You may overturn thrones, but what proof that anything better will grow upon the soil?

 - Events are only the shells of ideas; and often it is the fluent thought of ages that is crystallized in a moment by the stroke of a pen or the point of a bayonet.
 - However logical our induction, the end of the thread is fastened upon the assurance of faith.
 - The city an epitome of the social world. All the belts of civilization intersect along its avenues. It contains the products of every moral zone. It is cosmopolitan, not only in a national, but a spiritual sense.

 - No one can truly see Christ, and drink in the influence of his character, and not be a Christian at heart.

 - Genius is the accumulated wealth of our humanity – its most intense development concentrated at one point, and then with clearer expression and with mysterious power shot back to us across the galvanic lines of thought and feeling.

 - Poetry is the utterance of deep and heart-felt truth – the true poet is very near the oracle.
 - The best answer to all objections urged against prayer is the fact that man cannot help praying; for we may be sure that that which is so spontaneous and ineradicable in human nature has its fitting objects and methods in the arrangements of a boundless Providence.

 - The temptation is not here, where you are reading about it or praying about it. It is down in your shop, among bales and boxes, ten-penny nails, and sand-paper.
 - Do not judge from mere appearances...
 - How often a new affection makes a new man! The sordid, cowering soul turns heroic. The frivolous girl becomes the steadfast martyr of patience and ministration, transfigured by deathless love. The career of bounding impulses turns into an anthem of sacred deeds.
 - Glorify a lie, legalize a lie, arm and equip a lie, consecrate a lie with solemn forms and awful penalties, and after all it is nothing but a lie.

 - The loss of fortune to a true man is but the trumpet challenge to renewed exertion, not the thunder stroke of destruction.
 - The way to overcome evil is to love something that is good.

 - It is not death to have the body called back to the earth, and dissolved into its kindred elements, and mouldered to dust, and, it may be, turn to daisies, in the grave. But it is death to have the soul paralyzed, its inner life quenched, its faculties dissipated; that is death.

 - Setting is preliminary to brighter rising; decay is a process of advancement; death is the condition of higher and more fruitful life.
 - It is exceedingly deleterious to withdraw the sanction of religion from amusement. If we feel that it is all injurious we should strip the earth of its flowers and blot out its pleasant sunshine.
