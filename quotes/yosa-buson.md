 - In lantern-light My yellow Chrysanthemums Lost all their color.
 - Throw open your window and let the scenery of clouds and sky enter your room.
 - In the water bucket a melon and an eggplant nodding to each other.
 - Young leaves The sound of a waterfall Heard from far and near.
 - In the spring rain, The pond and the river Have become one.
 - I came to the flowers; I slept beneath them; this was my leisure.
 - Grasses are misty, The waters silent- A tranquil evening.
 - The spring sea rising and falling, rising and falling all day.
 - The end of spring- the poet is brooding about editors.
 - White dew- one drop on each thorn.
