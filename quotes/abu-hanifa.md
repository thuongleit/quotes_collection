 - Who are we to wish for Paradise? It will be enough if Allah spares us his wrath.
 - If I were you I would face my clothes, to make sure that no one runs off with them!
 - Faith does not increase, nor does it decrease; because a diminution in it would be unbelief.
 - When a hadeeth is found to be saheeh, then that is my madhhab.
