 - Everyone has his own specific vocation or mission in life; everyone must carry out a concrete assignment that demands fulfillment. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated, thus, everyone’s task is unique as his specific opportunity to implement it.
 - The salvation of man is through love and in love.

 - In some ways suffering ceases to be suffering at the moment it finds a meaning, such as the meaning of a sacrifice.
 - Decisions, not conditions, determine what a man is.
 - If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering.
 - Man does not simply exist but always decides what his existence will be, what he will become the next moment. By the same token, every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.
 - If there is meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.
 - Man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life.
 - Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked.

 - The existential vacuum manifests itself mainly in a state of boredom.
 - View your life from your funeral, looking back at your life experiences, what have you accomplished? What would you have wanted to accomplish but didn’t? What were the happy moments? What were the sad? What would you do again, and what you wouldn’t.
 - If we take a man as he is, we make him worse, but if we take man as he should be we make him capable of becoming what he can be.
 - The one thing you can’t take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one’s freedoms is to choose one’s attitude in any given circumstance.
 - The quest for meaning is the key to mental health and human flourishing.
 - But there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.

 - Happiness cannot be pursued; it must ensue.
 - Pain from problems and disappointments, etc., is inevitable in life, but suffering is a choice determined by whether you choose to compare your experience and pain to something better and therefore feel unlucky and bitter or to something worse and therefore feel lucky and grateful!
 - Self-actualization cannot be attained if it is made an end in itself, but only as a side effect of self-transcendence.
 - Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire.
 - Pain is only bearable if we know it will end, not if we deny it exists.
 - I want you to listen to what your conscience commands you to do and go on to carry it out to the best of your knowledge. Then you will live to see that in the long run- in the long run, I say! – success will follow you precisely because you had forgotten to think of it.
 - There are only two races, the decent and the indecent.
 - Life is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her own life.
 - Man’s search for meaning is the primary motivation in his life and not a “secondary rationalization” of instinctual drives. This meaning is unique and specific in that it must and can be fulfilled by him alone; only then does it achieve a significance which will satisfy his own will to meaning.
 - We can discover this meaning in life in three different ways: 1. by doing a deed; 2. by experiencing a value; and 3. by suffering.
 - Even when it is not fully attained, we become better by striving for a higher goal.
 - There are two races of men in this world but only these two: the race of the decent man and the race of the indecent man.

 - The point is not what we expect from life, but rather what life expects from us.
 - No man should judge unless he asks himself in absolute honesty whether in a similar situation he might not have done the same.
 - At any moment, man must decide, for better or for worse, what will be the monument of his existence.
 - You don’t create your mission in life – you detect it.
 - What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us.
 - Life can be pulled by goals just as surely as it can be pushed by drives.
 - It is not freedom from conditions, but it is freedom to take a stand toward the conditions.
 - For the meaning of life differs from man to man, from day to day and from hour to hour. What matters, therefore, is not the meaning of life in general but rather the specific meaning of a person’s life at a given moment.
 - Every human being has the freedom to change at any instant.
 - Love is the only way to grasp another human being in the innermost core of his personality. No one can become fully aware of the very essence of another human being unless he loves him. By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features.

 - Everywhere man is confronted with fate, with a chance of achieving something through his own suffering.

 - How can we dare to predict the behavior of man? We may predict the movements of a machine, of an automaton; more than this, we many even try to predict the mechanisms or “dynamisms” of the human psyche as well. But man is more than psyche.
 - Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.
 - As for the concept of collective guilt, I personally think that it is totally unjustified to hold one person responsible for the behavior of another person or a collective of persons.
