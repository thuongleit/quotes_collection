 - There is no such thing as a normal period of history. Normality is a fiction of economic textbooks.
 - The point of studying economics is so as not to be fooled by economists.
 - Economic theorists should not make such a production about taking a rabbit out of a hat after having put the rabbit into the hat in full view of the audience.

 - It’s a terrible thing to be a worker exploited in the capitalist system. The only worse thing is to be a worker unable to find anyone to exploit you.
 - Utility is a metaphysical concept of impregnable circularity; utility is the quality in commodities that makes individuals want to buy them, and the fact that individuals want to buy commodities shows that they have utility.
 - Even if the crises that are looming up are overcome and a new run of prosperity lies ahead, deeper problems will still remain. Modern capitalism has no purpose except to keep the show going.
 - But, as soon as speculators become an important influence in the market, their business is to speculate on each others behaviour.
 - It is the business of economists, not to tell us what to do, but show why what we are doing anyway is in accord with proper principles.
