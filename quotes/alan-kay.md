 - In computers, every ‘new explosion’ was set off by a software product that allowed users to program differently.
 - The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free? The Web, in comparison, is a joke. The Web was done by amateurs.

 - Quite a few people have to believe something is normal before it becomes normal – a sort of ‘voting’ situation. But once the threshold is reached, then everyone demands to do whatever it is.
 - I fear – as far as I can tell – that most undergraduate degrees in computer science these days are basically Java vocational training.
 - The flip side of the coin was that even good programmers and language designers tended to do terrible extensions when they were in the heat of programming, because design is something that is best done slowly and carefully.
 - Understanding- -like civilization, happiness, music, science and a host of other great endeavors – is not a state of being, but a manner of traveling. This great road has no final destination. The journey itself is the reward.
