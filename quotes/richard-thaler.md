 - A good rule of thumb is to assume that everything matters.
 - So, what’s a nudge? A nudge is some small feature of the environment that attracts our attention and alters our behavior.
 - My mantra is if you want to help people accomplish some goal, make it easy.
 - The assumption that everybody will figure out how much they have to save and then will just implement that plan is obviously preposterous.
 - There are cases when I can make myself better off by restricting my future choices and commit myself to a specific course of action.
 - The lesson from behavioral economics is that people only save if it’s automatic.
 - When an economist says the evidence is “mixed,” he or she means that theory says one thing and data says the opposite.
 - Recall that people like to do what most people think it is right to do; recall too that people like to do what most people actually do.
 - I don’t go by the ratings. I buy wine that tastes good. Statistically, anybody’s ability to predict what will be a good wine a decade from now is limited.
 - Why tie to gold? Why not 1982 Bordeaux?
 - I think the people who’ve been the most overconfident in our business in the last decade have been the people that called themselves risk managers.
 - The same with the mortgage brokers that were selling people mortgages they couldn’t afford. We shouldn’t pay them on each mortgage they write. They should have what they call “skin in the game,” where they’ve got to reimburse us if the guy who sold the mortgage defaults.
 - I think one lesson we have to learn is that there’s a lot more risk than we’re giving credit to, a lot more what economist calls systematic risk.
 - People exaggerate their own skills. they are optimistic about their prospects and overconfident about their guesses, including which managers to pick.
 - I’m all for empowerment and education, but the empirical evidence is that it doesn’t work. That’s why I say make it easy.
 - Most people start claiming benefits within a year of when they become eligible, although benefits increase substantially if they wait.
 - Everyone’s lost a lot of money on their 401k plans. I’ve heard some people calling them 201k plans. So it’s even more important to get people to be saving more for retirement. Behavioral economics has helped us learn a lot about how to do that.
 - When should we nudge and when should we shove, I think, it’s a political judgment. Obviously in some situations we need shoves, we need laws. Fraud is against the law, murder is against the law, drunk-driving is against the law. We don’t need just nudges.
 - I think we also have learned the lesson that we have to have better incentive structures.
 - Investors must keep in mind that there’s a difference between a good company and a good stock. After all, you can buy a good car but pay too much for it.
 - Credit cards have been extremely profitable to banks. They’re profitable not from the fees they collect from the retailers that use the credit cards, that pays the bills, but the real profits come from the interest payments and the charges to users that are unexpected.
 - A company invites their employees to sign up for a plan where every time they get a raise, some part of that raise goes to increasing their contribution rate to the 401k plan. In the first company we convinced to adopt this plan, saving rates tripled.
 - So the world is much more correlated than we give credit to. And so we see more of what Nassim Taleb calls “black swan events” – rare events happen more often than they should because the world is more correlated.
 - Most economists, including me, agree that longevity insurance would make sense for a lot of people.
 - There’s a second component of a good savings plan, which is something that a colleague of mine called Schlomo Benartzi and I developed many years ago, that we call “save more tomorrow.”
 - If rather than setting the minimum balance as the lowest possible amount, so we keep people in debt for as long as possible, we raise the minimum payment and encourage people to pay off their credit cards, we’re going to make less money, but we’re going to have costumers that are more solvent.
 - It would be much more consumer friendly for them to beep you when you swipe your card that says, uh-oh you’re over your limit, are you sure you want to use that?
 - If people just put away what’s left at the end of the month, that’s a recipe for failure.
 - It turns out, that men, when they’re taking care of their business, they’re not fully attending to the task at hand, but, I’m sure there’s an evolutionary explanation for this, if you give them a target, they will aim.
 - One simple step firms can take is make sure that people that are getting paid a lot of money, say more than a million or two, that a big chunk of that money is deferred. That’s going to change the whole ballgame.
 - Every American worker should be able to save for retirement via payroll deductions.
 - The reason is they failed to learned the primary lesson we should have learned from when Long Term Capital Management went belly up ten years ago. That is, investments that seem uncorrelated can be correlated simply because we’re interested in it.
 - Is there a market for somebody selling a credit card that helps people pay down their balances? I think the question is yes. But it would have to be sold by a bank that’s really willing to invest in being a trusted partner with its consumers, because they will make less money on each consumer.
