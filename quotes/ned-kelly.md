 - I do not pretend that I have led a blameless life, or that one fault justifies another, but the public in judging a case like mine should remember that the darkest life may now have a bright side.
 - If my lips teach the public that men are made mad by bad treatment, and if the police are taught that they may exasperate to madness men they persecute and ill treat, my life will not be entirely thrown away.
 - But I am a widows son outlawed and my orders must be obeyed.
 - It’s no use blaming anyone now.
 - I fear it as little as to drink a cup of tea.
 - I do not wish to give the order full force without giving timely warning but I am a widow’s son outlawed and must be obeyed.
