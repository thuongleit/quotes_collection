 - I use to love you honey, ’til you spent all my money.
 - Everybody started calling my music rock and roll, but it wasn’t anything but the same rhythm and blues I’d been playing down in New Orleans.
 - Clean living keeps me in shape. Righteous thoughts are my secret. And New Orleans home cooking.
 - Don’t send me no letter, cause I can’t read.
