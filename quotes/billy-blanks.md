 - Discipline is remembering what you want most, not what you want now.
 - When you become confident with your inner-self, the outside’s just going to fall into place.
 - Where I am today, is where my mind and will put me, where I am tomorrow is where my mind will put me.
 - Today is a reality, tomorrow’s a promise, and yesterday’s history!
 - It doesn’t matter if it’s in my class or around the world, anywhere, the first thing I say is “First of all guys, I want to give my Heavenly Father credit for all I do and the Lord Jesus Christ to give me the opportunity to go out and reach and save lives.” To me, that’s the most important thing.
