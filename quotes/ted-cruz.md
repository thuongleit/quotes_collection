 - Of course, without God, there is no value to life. That leads to immorality, that leads to sexual abuse, and there is no hope.
 - The day General Soleimani flew back from Moscow to Iran was the day we believed that Russia used cyber warfare against the joint chiefs. We need a new commander in chief that will stand up to our enemies.
 - Do you know how many aliens Bill Clinton deported? 12 million. Do you know how many illegal aliens, George W. Bush deported? 10 million. We can enforce the laws and if we secure the border, that solves the problem. And as president I will solve this problem and secure the border.
 - In the 13 months I’ve been in the Senate, it has become apparent to me the single thing that Republican politicians hate and fear the most, and that is when they’re forced to tell the truth. It makes their heads explode.

 - Let me tell you, communism does not work! Socialism does not work!
 - If you want to beat Donald Trump, you know, one of the clearest indications of who can beat Trump is Donald spends every waking moment attacking me. He doesn’t attack any other candidates, because his campaign views us as the only real threat to him.
 - We have to stop acquiescing even to the wording that the liberals use.
 - Millions of Americans are standing up and saying, ‘We want our country back!’ Republicans, Democrats, Independents, will not go down the path of Greece, we will not go quietly into the night.

 - Donald Trump threatened to file a defamation suit against me for running a TV ad that consisted only entirely of his own words on national television. Now, that’s really a remarkable theory, that it is defamation to show people what he said on national TV. I think the voters are smarter than that.
 - Because the math is, if you – 5 percent of a million is a lot more than 5 percent of a thousand. So yeah, someone who makes more money, numerically, it’s gonna be higher. But the greatest gains, percentage-wise, for people, are gonna be at the lower end of our plan.
 - What I’ve tried to do in politics is two very simple things: tell the truth and do what I said I would do.

 - There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible. And not a one of them is as good.
 - Instead of being a Woodrow Wilson democracy promoterwe ought to hunt down our enemies and kill ISIS rather than creating opportunities for ISIS to take control of new countries.

 - Voters are hungry for principled, conservative fighters – because the threat to our liberties from Washington never has been greater.
 - We’re saying the Washington establishment run behind Donald Trump.
 - I believe over the long term he’s going to have the money, and he’s got the message, that this is going to be one of the finalists for the presidential campaign.
 - What I endeavor to do is shine a light on what happens at the court, both as a law clerk and then as a litigator litigating and winning major cases in front of the Supreme Court over and over and over again.
 - As conservatives, as Republicans, we keep winning elections. We got a Republican House, we’ve got a Republican Senate, and we don’t have leaders who honor their commitments. I will always tell the truth and do what I said I would do.
 - Any military force should be dictated by the vital national security interests of the United States. And if and when we use force, we should use overwhelming force for a clearly stated objective. And then when we’re done, we should get the heck out.
 - I believe everyone here has a right to speak out on politics as effectively as possible.
 - There’s a real danger when people get distracted by peripheral issues. They get distracted by democracy building. They get distracted about military conflicts. We need to focus on defeating jihadism.
 - A debate actually is a policy issue but I will say this – gosh, if you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage.
 - I offer myself as a leader to the people of this country because I think they’re looking for solutions, not lawyers arguing over laws or entertainers throwing out sound bites that draw media attention. We need to solve the problem.

 - We are still a nation of laws. You just have to check with Barack Obama every day to see what they are.

 - The proper way to make policy decisions under our Constitution in America is for the people to do so through the democratic process.
 - Political correctness is bad.
 - President Obama, when he was elected, he could have been a unifying figure. He could have chosen to be a leader on race relations and bring us together. And he hasn’t done that, he’s made decisions that I think have inflamed racial tensions that have divided us rather than bringing us together.
 - We’re seeing something fairly remarkable happen on the political train. We’re seeing the Washington establishment abandoning Marco Rubio. I think they’ve made the determination that Marco can’t win. And they’re rushing to support Donald Trump.
 - We’re seeing is young people who are optimistic, who want a future, want our constitutional rights, are coming to our campaign.
 - I do think we should be focused on substance and record. If you want a candidate who opposes amnesty, who opposes citizenship for the 12 million people here illegally, I’m the only candidate in the race who opposes that.
 - We need a president who stands up, number one, and says, we will defeat ISIS. And number two, says the greatest national security threat facing America is a nuclear Iran.
 - The court follows elite opinion, not public opinion. And Democratic leaders in Congress and Republican leaders in Congress follow elite opinion as well. It’s what I’ve called “the Washington cartel.” It’s career politicians in both parties. It is lobbyists and giant corporations.
 - We are seeing a great awakening. A national movement of We the People, brought together by what unites us – a shared love of liberty, and an understanding of the unlimited potential of free men and free women.
 - I think the first and principle objective is to repeal Obamacare before it does lasting, fundamental damage to our health care system, to our individual liberty, to the relationship each of us has with his or her doctor.

 - When you had a terrorist, you could only search a relatively narrow slice of numbers, primarily land lines.
 - About 65 percent of Republicans believe that Donald Trump is not the best candidate to go head to head with Hillary Clinton.
 - ISIS says they want to go back and reject modernity? Well, I think we should help them. We ought to bomb them back to the Stone Age!

 - What I think is at stake in 2012, is whether the five or six strong conservatives elected to the Senate in 2010 become 10 or 12. And if that happens, it will fundamentally shift the character of the Senate. It will shift the balance.
 - Donald Trump agreed with Hillary Clinton supporting John Kerry. He agreed with Hillary Clinton on being – quote – “neutral” between Israel and the Palestinians.
 - We have 400,000 small businesses forming every year in this country. How great is that? They are employing themselves, they are potentially employing others. The bad news is, we have 470,000 going out of business every year. And why? They cite Obamacare.
 - We’ll be getting new health insurance and we’ll presumably do it through my job with the Senate, and so we’ll be on the federal exchange with millions of others on the federal exchange.
 - If as a voter you think what we need is more Republicans in Washington to cut a deal with Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, then I guess Donald Trump’s your guy.
 - Listen, if you’re a hardworking steelworker or truck driver, that drives down your wages. That takes away your jobs.
 - If you want a candidate who is led the fight against Obamacare, who will lift the burdens on small businesses and bring back jobs, I’m the only candidate in the race with that proven record.
 - If I’m elected president, we will secure the border. We will triple the border patrol. We will build a wall that works and I’ll get Donald Trump to pay for it.
 - Mike Huckabee says the answer to our problems is to cure all diseases. I guess no one’s thought of that before.
 - It is worth emphasizing that Iran released our hostages in 1981 the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.
 - I don’t think we should be engaged in nation-building. It’s not our job to turn foreign nations into democratic utopias, to try to turn Iraq into Switzerland. It is the military’s job to hunt down and kill our enemies, to kill ISIS before they murder American citizens and they wage jihad.
 - Hispanic unemployment is higher than the national average and when the federal government is killing small businesses and killing jobs it is hurting the future of the Hispanic community and we need to carry that message.
 - There’s not a single Democrat here. It’s almost like CPAC invited Benjamin Netanyahu to speak. Well, we could have had Hillary here, but we couldn’t find a foreign nation to foot the bill.
 - Barack Obama has said he doesn’t believe in American leadership or America winning – he is wrong. America can win again and we will win again.
 - We’re seeing so many people come around and say, “Listen, we want a real conservative. We don’t want a Washington dealmaker who will support Democrats and cut deals to grow government and give into the cronyism and corporate welfare.”
 - America is at war. Our enemy is not violent extremism. It is not some unnamed malevolent force. It is radical Islamic terrorist.
 - The front line with ISIS isn’t just in Iraq and Syria, it’s in Kennedy Airport and the Rio Grande. Border security is national security.
 - We need to focus on radical Islamic terrorists and we need to stop them before they carry out acts of terror.
 - I think our nation faces enormous challenges, and we need leaders who are willing to tell the truth and do the right thing regardless of the consequences.
 - I think if you’re at home and you don’t want Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee, then the only candidate who can beat Donald is our campaign. And so I would encourage, even if you like another candidate, stand with us if you don’t want Donald to be the nominee.
 - But you know what? There’s far more pain involved in rolling over, far more pain in hiding in the shadows, far more pain in not standing for principle, not standing for the good, not standing for integrity.
 - We need a much better understanding of the climate before making policy choices that would impose substantial economic costs on our Nation.
 - The authorizing committees are free to set their agency budgets, and that includes NASA.
 - I recognize that folks in the press love to see Republican-on-Republican violence, and so you want me to say something bad about Donald Trump, or bad about John McCain or bad about anyone else, i’m not going to do it.
 - At the end of the day, the Washington establishment is going to go where they’re going to go.
 - Everyone seems to have internalized the fact that you can say anything you want at a televised debate, and only a tiny fraction of the audience will ever see a fact-check. So why not claim the moon is square?

 - I believe the American people are looking for someone to speak the truth.

 - I think we need to be fighting for the working men and women of this country, not the moneyed New York interests.

 - I think President’s candidates need shock collars or something.
 - This country is always changing. But my point about the Supreme Court is the Supreme Court didn’t wait for the country to change. Five unelected lawyers overruled 320 million Americans.
 - If you see a candidate that Washington embraces, run and hide.
 - I love Texas, I can’t wait in a couple of days to be home to the great state.
 - In fact, I think we’re less safe. We get so distracted by all of the information, we’re not spending enough time getting specific immigration – specific information on terrorists.
 - Every parent is wondering, how do we keep our kids safe? We need a commander in chief who does what Ronald Reagan did with communism, which is he set out a global strategy to defeat Soviet communism.
 - You can’t get to a balanced budget and begin to pay down debt and thus create jobs in this country if you don’t have specific plans to make it work.
 - One of the problems in Washington is there are far too many politicians who desperately just want to get re-elected.
 - And many of the alarmists on global warming, they’ve got a problem cause the science doesn’t back them up. And in particular, satellite data demonstrate for the last 17 years, there’s been zero warming. None whatsoever.

 - It’s critical to have a sound foundation in free-market economics and the Constitution. A great many Republicans in Washington don’t have that foundation.

 - Whenever anyone does as this ad does, plays the actual words of Donald Trump on national television, his response is to yell, “Liar.” Their strategy is simply to yell, “Liar, liar, liar.”

 - As president, I wouldn’t be making the day-to-day combat decisions. The job of the commander-in-chief is to lay the objective out and then you rely upon the generals and admirals and commanders to give you their expert advice on the tools needed to carry out that objective.
