 - Almost everything will work again if you unplug it for a few minutes, including you.
 - All freedom comes from discipline.

 - Hope begins in the dark.
 - It’s better to be kind than to be right.
 - A good marriage is where both people feel like they're getting the better end of the deal.

 - I’m here to be me, which is taking a great deal longer than I had hoped.
 - The opposite of faith is not doubt, it’s certainty.
 - You can get the monkey off your back, but the circus never leaves town.
 - Writing and reading decrease our sense of isolation. They deepen and widen and expand our sense of life: they feed the soul.

 - Forgiveness means it finally becomes unimportant that you hit back.
 - The truth of my experience is that we are all a lot more alike than we are different.
 - It’s good to do uncomfortable things. It’s weight training for life.
 - In fact, not forgiving is like drinking rat poison and then waiting for the rat to die.
 - I love silence. I seek and create it at every opportunity. I need it to work.

 - Faith includes noticing the mess, the emptiness and discomfort, and letting it be there until some light returns.

 - You can either practice being right or practice being kind.
 - We are not here to see through one another, but to see one another through.
 - It’s a great time to be alive.

 - Creative expression, whether that means writing, dancing, bird-watching, or cooking, can give a person almost everything that he or she has been searching for: enlivenment, peace, meaning, and the incalculable wealth of time spent quietly in beauty.
 - I didn’t need to understand the hypostatic unity of the Trinity; I just needed to turn my life over to whoever came up with redwood trees.
 - The difference between you and God is that God doesn’t think He’s you.
 - We write to expose the unexposed. If there is one door in the castle you have been told not to go through, you must. The writer’s job is to turn the unspeakable into words – not just into any words, but if we can, into rhythm and blues.
 - Prayer means that, in some unique way, we believe we’re invited into a relationship with someone who hears us when we speak in silence.
 - And as it turns out, if one person is praying for you, buckle up. Things can happen.
 - Dogs are the closest we come to knowing the divine love of God on this side of eternity.
 - I go to church every Sunday, which is like going to the gas station once a week and really, really filling up.
 - To love yourself as you are is a miracle, and to seek yourself is to have found yourself for now. And now is all we have, and love is who we are.
 - My deepest belief is that to live as if we’re dying can set us free. Dying people teach you to pay attention and to forgive and not to sweat the small things.

 - Your problem is how you are going to spend this one and precious life you have been issued. Whether you’re going to spend it trying to look good and creating the illusion that you have power over circumstances, or whether you are going to taste it, enjoy it and find out the truth about who you are.
 - Whenever the world throws rose petals at you, which thrill and seduce the ego, beware.

 - When everything starts going wrong all at once, it is to protect something big and lovely that is trying to get itself born.
 - I was reminded of the Four Immutable Laws of the Spirit: Whoever is present are the right people. Whenever it begins is the right time. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have happened. And when it’s over, it’s over.
 - Some people have a thick skin and you don’t. Your heart is really open and that is going to cause pain, but that is an appropriate response to this world. The cost is high, but the blessing of being compassionate is beyond your wildest dreams.

 - Sometimes grace works like water wings when you feel you are sinking.
 - Getting into a new relationship is like pouring Miracle-Gro on your character defects.

 - I write because writing is the gift God has given me to help people in the world.
 - Everyone is screwed up, broken, clingy, and scared, even the people who seem to have it more or less together. They are much more like you than you would believe. So try not to compare your insides to their outsides.
 - Grief, as I read somewhere once, is a lazy Susan. One day it is heavy and underwater, and the next day it spins and stops at loud and rageful, and the next day at wounded keening, and the next day numbness, silence.

 - I am going to try to pay attention to the spring. I am going to look around at all the flowers, and look up at the hectic trees. I am going to close my eyes and listen.
 - This is what separates artists from ordinary people: the belief, deep in our hearts, that if we build our castles well enough, somehow the ocean won’t wash them away. I think this is a wonderful kind of person to be.
 - I don’t remember who said this, but there really are places in the heart you don’t even know exist until you love a child.
 - Joy is the best makeup. But a little lipstick is a close runner-up.
 - The grief and tears didn’t wash me away. They gave me my life back! They cleansed me, baptized me, hydrated the earth at my feet.
 - Good therapy helps. Good friends help. Pretending that we are doing better than we are doesn’t. Shame doesn’t. Being heard does.

 - Love falls to earth, rises from the ground, pools around the afflicted. Love pulls people back to their feet. Bodies and souls are fed. Bones and lives heal. New blades of grass grow from charred soil. The sun rises.
 - The reason I never give up hope is because everything is so basically hopeless.
 - I thought such awful thoughts that I cannot even say them out loud because they would make Jesus want to drink gin straight out of the cat dish.

 - Forgiveness is having given up all hope of having had a better past.

 - The first holy truth in God 101 is that men and women of true faith have always had to accept the mystery of God’s identity and love and ways. I hate that, but it’s the truth.
 - Sometimes this human stuff is slimy and pathetic – jealousy especially so – but better to feel it and talk about it and walk through it than to spend a lifetime being silently poisoned.
 - Because this business of becoming conscious, of being a writer, is ultimately about asking yourself, How alive am I willing to be?
 - Everybody thinks their opinion is the right one. If they didn’t, they would get a new one.
 - I get to tell my truth. I get to seek meaning and realization. I get to live fully, wildly, imperfectly. That’s why I’m alive. And all I actually have to offer as a writer is my version of life. Every single thing that has happened to me is mine.

 - A writer paradoxically seeks the truth and tells lies every step of the way. It’s a lie if you make something up. But you make it up in the name of truth, and then you give your heart to expressing it clearly.
 - My dad taught me that to be a writer is a decision and a habit. It’s not anything lofty, and it doesn’t have that much to do with inspiration. You have to develop the habit of being a certain way with yourself. You do it at the debt of honor.
 - The difference between a writer who toughs it out and one who doesn’t is that you push through the parts where you know that you’ve just written seven pages when all you’re looking for is one paragraph.

 - I was the angriest daughter on earth, and also, one of the most devoted.

 - But easy’s like, who cares? Easy’s like, how much is easy going to get you?

 - There is ecstasy in paying attention. You can get into a kind of Wordsworthian openness to the world, where you see in everything the essence of holiness.

 - Small is how blessings, healing, progress and increase occur.
 - One line of dialogue that rings true reveals character in a way that pages of description can’t.
 - I am all the ages I’ve ever been.
 - Writing is how I communicate my deepest beliefs, and what I hope are helpful observations about our dual citizenship, as children of God, as regular old mixed-up, worried, flawed, precious human beings.
 - To be engrossed by something outside ourselves is a powerful antidote for the rational mind, the mind that so frequently has its head up its own ass.
 - The thing about light is that it really isn’t yours; it’s what you gather and shine back. And it gets more power from reflectiveness; if you sit still and take it in, it fills your cup, and then you can give it off yourself.
 - I don’t have any romantic views of parenting. Every step of the way it’s really hard. It’s a dangerous world, physically and psychologically.
 - Nothing heals us like letting people know our scariest parts: When people listen to you cry and lament, and look at you with love, it’s like they are holding the baby of you.
 - Every woman’s path is difficult, and many mothers were as equipped to raise children as wire monkey mothers. I say that without judgment: It is, sadly, true. An unhealthy mother’s love is withering.
 - A big heart is both a clunky and a delicate thing; it doesn’t protect itself and it doesn’t hide. It stands out, like a baby’s fontanel, where you can see the soul pulse through.

 - When we agree to being part of something bigger than our own wired, fixated minds, we are saved.
 - Mine was a patchwork God, sewn together from bits of rag and ribbon, Eastern and Western, pagan and Hebrew, everything but the kitchen sink and Jesus.
 - Certainty is missing the point entirely.
 - All criticism hurts me. I’m so in the wrong business.
 - I liked those ladies! They were helpers, and they danced.? These are the words I want on my gravestone: that I was a helper, and that I danced.
 - I’ve always thought I could use my brain and my heart to jockey everyone around to the good. But life is not jockeyable. When you try, you make people infinitely crazier than they already were, including or especially yourself.

 - The world is always going to be dangerous, and people get badly banged up, but how can there be more meaning than helping one another stand up in a wind and stay warm?

 - Write as if your parents are dead.
 - Sometimes I think God loves the ones who most desperately ache and are most desperately lost – his or her wildest, most messed-up children – the way you’d ache and love a screwed-up rebel daughter in juvenile hall.
 - My writer friends, and they are legion, do not go around beaming with quiet feelings of contentment. Most of them go around with haunted, abused, surprised looks on their faces, like lab dogs on whom very personal deodorant sprays have been tested.
 - Just don’t pretend you know more about your characters than they do, because you don’t. Stay open to them. It’s teatime and all the dolls are at the table. Listen. It’s that simple.
 - I spent my whole life helping my mother carry around her psychic trunks like a bitter bellhop. So a great load was lifted when she died, and my life was much easier.
 - I see that children fill the existential hollowness many people feel; that when we have children, we know they will need us, and maybe love us, but we don’t have a clue how hard it is going to be.
 - I would seriously rather be in a long line at the DMV than eat with people I don’t know.
 - My mother was a not-too-devoted atheist. She went to Episcopal church on Christmas Eve every year, and that was mostly it.
 - My mother’s eyes were large and brown, like my son’s, but unlike Sam’s, they were always frantic, like a hummingbird who can’t quite find the flower but keeps jabbing around.
 - Sam said to me the other day, “I love you like 20 tyrannosauruses on 20 mountaintops,” and this is the exact same way in which I love him.
 - Jealousy has always been my cross, the weakness and woundedness in me that has most often caused me to feel ugly and unlovable, like the Bad Seed.
 - On the spiritual path, all the dreck and misery is transformed, maybe not that same day, but still transformed into spiritual fuel or insight.
 - We all know we’re going to die; what’s important is the kind of men and women we are in the face of this.
 - Laughter is the key that grace has arrived.
 - I don’t have very sophisticated taste in music. I listen to a lot of folk music. I like reggae.
 - Where do we even start on the daily walk of restoration and awakening? We start where we are.
 - Rationality squeezes out much that is rich and juicy and fascinating.
 - No one is more sentimentalized in America than mothers on Mother’s Day, but no one is more often blamed for the culture’s bad people and behavior.
 - When I was young, I used to be so jealous of other girls that it crippled me.
 - I have a giant ego and terrible self-esteem, so I need to hit the re-set button fairly regularly – to get into presence, and humility, and being right-sized.
 - One of the gifts of being a writer is that it gives you an excuse to do things, to go places and explore. Another is that writing motivates you to look closely at life, at life as it lurches by and tramps around.
 - What an incredible drug fear is.
 - Most of me was glad when my mother died. She was a handful, but not in a cute, festive way. More in a life-threatening way, that had caused me a long time ago to give up all hope of ever feeling good about having had her as a mother.
 - Sometimes it feels like God has reached down and touched me, blessed me a thousand times over, and sometimes it all feels like a mean joke, like God’s advisers are Muammar Qaddafi and Phyllis Schlafly.

 - When hope is not pinned wriggling onto a shiny image or expectation, it sometimes floats forth and opens.
 - I wish there were shortcuts to wisdom and self-knowledge: cuter abysses or three-day spa wilderness experiences. Sadly, it doesn’t work that way. I so resent this.
 - Grace arrived, like the big, loopy stitches with which a grandmotherly stranger might baste your hem temporarily.
 - There are these people who keep taking you in and feeding you and loving you and making the world a tiny bit safer than it feels. People have community and family, but existentially we are deeply isolated.
 - I cry intermittently, like a summer rain. I don’t feel racked by the crying; in fact, it hydrates me. Then rage wells up in me, and I want to take a crowbar to all the cars in the neighborhood.
 - I can never tell what I’m doing when I’m in the middle of publication because I have no confidence. I have terrible self-esteem, along with boundless narcissism.
 - I just try to love and serve everyone, and bring everyone water, and lend an ear; that’s what Jesus said to do.
 - Now, if you ask me, what’s going on is that we’re all up to here in it, and probably the most important thing is that we not yell at one another.
