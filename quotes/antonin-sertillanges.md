 - Friendship is an obstetric art; it draws out our richest and deepest resources; it unfolds the wings of our dreams and hidden indeterminate thoughts; it serves as a check on our judgements, tries out our new ideas, keeps up our ardor, and inflames our enthusiasm.
 - The reward of a work is to have produced it; the reward of effort is to have grown by it.
 - Courage is sustained by calling up anew the vision of the goal.
 - We must beware of yielding to the pressure of a spirit of cowardly conformity which proclaims itself everybodyâ€™s friend in the hope that everybody will obligingly return the compliment.
