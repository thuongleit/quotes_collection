 - To travel, to experience and learn: that is to live.
 - If it is a shame to be the second man on Mount Everest, then I will have to live with this shame.
 - It has been a long road. From a mountain coolie, a bearer of loads, to a wearer of a coat with rows of medals who is carried about in planes and worries about income tax.
 - If I know I make this much trouble, I never climb Everest.
 - I have climbed my mountain, but I must still live my life.
