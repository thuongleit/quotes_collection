 - What I envy most about you Christians is your forgiveness; I have nobody to forgive me.
 - One can never be sure of the end, only of the means, and so we must be sure that the means are good.
 - The only good thing we can do, the only goodness we can be sure of, is our own goodness as individuals and the good that we can individually do. As groups we often do evil that good may come and very often the good does not come and all that is left is the evil we have pointlessly done.
