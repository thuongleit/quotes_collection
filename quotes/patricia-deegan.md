 - The concept of recovery is rooted in the simple yet profound realization that people who have been diagnosed with mental illness are human beings.
 - The goal of recovery is not to become normal. The goal is to embrace the human vocation of becoming more deeply, more fully human.
 - We are a conspiracy of hope and we are pressing back against the strong tide of oppression which for centuries has been the legacy of those of us who are labelled with mental illness. We are refusing to reduce human beings to illnesses.
 - The goal is to become the unique, awesome, never to be repeated human being that we were called to be.
 - We share in the certainty that people labeled with mental illness are first and above all, human beings. Our lives are precious and are of infinite value.
 - I believe it is a spirit of hope that gathers us here together today.
