 - Politics should be limited in scope to ware, protection of property, and the occasional precautionary beheading of a member of the ruling class.

 - The political process consists entirely of politicians talking out of their butts.
 - The average IQ in America is – and this can be proven mathematically – average.
 - Creative writing teachers should be purged until every last instructor who has uttered the words ‘Write what you know’ is confined to a labor camp.

 - In Japan people drive on the left. In China people drive on the right. In Vietnam it doesn’t matter.
