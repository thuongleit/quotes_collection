 - Does virtual intimacy degrade our experience of the other kind and, indeed, of all encounters, of any kind?
 - The most used program in computers and education is PowerPoint. What are you learning about the nature of the medium by knowing how do to a great PowerPoint presentation? Nothing. It certainly doesnt teach you how to think critically about living in a culture of simulation.
 - Networked, we are together, but so lessened are our expectations of each other that we can feel utterly alone. And there is the risk that we come to see others as objects to be accessed – and only for the parts we find useful, comforting, or amusing.

Children are nostalgic for the ‘good old days’ when parents used to read to them without the cell phone by their side or watch football games or Disney movies without having the BlackBerry handy.
 - As we distribute ourselves, we may abandon ourselves.
 - People are lonely. The network is seductive. But if we are always on, we may deny ourselves the rewards of solitude.

 - Teenagers would rather text than talk. They feel calls would reveal too much.
