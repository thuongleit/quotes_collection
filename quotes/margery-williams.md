 - Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.
 - Once you are real you can’t become unreal again. It lasts for always.
 - When you are Real you don’t mind being hurt.
 - It doesn’t happen all at once. You become. It takes a long time.
 - When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.
 - Of what use was it to be loved and lose one’s beauty and become Real if it all ended like this? And a tear, a real tear, trickled down his little shabby velvet nose and fell to the ground.
 - He didn’t mind how he looked to other people, because the nursery magic had made him Real, and when you are Real shabbiness doesn’t matter.
