 - Mowing your lawn is against nature.
 - Places that have experienced great defeat experience a kind of rebirth, which I think America has to do – unless we want to get more decrepit. I don’t think we have to destroy the place totally.

 - I’ve written songs for Shirley Bassey, Marianne Faithfull, and Linda Thompson. I sort of focus on these wonderful, aging divas. But maybe that’s because I think I’m Christina Aguilera.

 - I definitely consider ‘Poses’ – the whole album in fact – to be kind of a miracle. Like the last breath of that moment when decadence is healthy, ‘Poses’ encapsulates that feeling. It’s a kind of song and a kind of album that I’ll never be able to repeat.
 - I’m hyper light-sensitive and must sleep in the equivalent of a sealed tomb.
