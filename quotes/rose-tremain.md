 - Life is not a dress rehearsal.
 - The unfolding of a story is both as exciting and as difficult for each and every novel I’ve written, regardless of time and place.
 - Writing is a strange synthesis between the two parts of your mind: the analytical side and the side that knows nothing at all, and you have to allow the dreaming side free rein.
 - In the planning stage of a book, don’t plan the ending. It has to be earned by all that will go before it.
 - Learn from cinema. Be economic with descriptions. Sort out the telling detail from the lifeless one. Write dialogue that people would actually speak.
 - Forget the boring old dictum, ‘Write about what you know.’ Instead, seek out an unknown yet knowable area of experience that’s going to enhance your understanding of the world and write about that.
 - There is something about the unexpected that moves us. As if the whole of existence is paid for in some way, except for that one moment, which is free.

 - Any setting can potentially acquire this vividness. It slowly arrives during the period of research, until it is as immediate to me as my own real surroundings.
 - Respect the way characters may change once they’ve got 50 pages of life in them. Revisit your plan at this stage and see whether certain things have to be altered to take account of these changes.
 - At the moment, I’m toying with a new idea for a book, but fully engaged with writing screenplays, so the book idea – which needs empty space in my head – is barely formed yet.
 - A novel usually takes me two years. A year to research and plan and dream. Then a year to write.
 - Listen to the criticisms and preferences of your trusted ‘first readers.’
