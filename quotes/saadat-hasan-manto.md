 - If you find my stories dirty, the society you are living in is dirty. With my stories, I only expose the truth.
 - Some people kiss as if they were eating watermelon.
 - I feel like I am always the one tearing everything up and forever sewing it back together.
 - But love, whether in Multan or on Siberia’s icy tundra, whether in the winter or the summer, whether among the rich or the poor, whether among the beautiful or the ugly, whether among the crude or refined, love is always just love. There’s no difference.
 - If you cannot bear these stories then the society is unbearable. Who am I to remove the clothes of this society, which itself is naked. I don’t even try to cover it, because it is not my job, that’s the job of dressmakers.
 - I wondered why people consider escapism so bad, even the escapism on display right then. At first it might appear unseemly, but in the end its lack of pretension gives it its own sort of beauty.
