 - To practice the process of conflict resolution, we must completely abandon the goal of getting people to do what we want.
 - We are compassionate with ourselves when we are able to embrace all parts of ourselves and recognize the needs and values expressed by each part.
 - Empathy is a respectful understanding of what others are experiencing. Instead of offering empathy, we often have a strong urge to give advice or reassurance and to explain our own position or feeling. Empathy, however, calls upon us to empty our mind and listen to others with our whole being.
 - NVC requires us to be continually conscious of the beauty within ourselves and other people.
 - Use anger as a wake-up call to unmet needs.
 - As we learn to speak from the heart we are changing the habits of a lifetime.
 - Use the words “I feel because I” to remind us that what we feel it isn’t because of what the other person did, but because of a choice I’ve made.
 - While we may not consider the way we talk to be ‘violent,’ our words often lead to hurt and pain, whether for others or for ourselves.
 - The cause of anger lies in our thinking – in thoughts of blame and judgment.
 - All violence is the result of people tricking themselves into believing that their pain derives from other people and that consequently those people deserve to be punished.
 - Self-empathy in NVC means checking in with your own feelings and needs.
 - The Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti once remarked that observing without evaluating is the highest form of human intelligence. When I first read this statement, the thought, ‘What nonsense!’ shot through my mind before I realized that I had just made an evaluation.
 - Intellectual understanding blocks empathy.
 - If you are a jackal, you will try to reassure. Jackals try to fix people in pain. They can’t stand pain, but make matters worse by trying to get rid of it. Put on giraffe ears. Try to hear what they are feeling and needing.
 - At the core of all anger is a need that is not being fulfilled.
 - A difficult message to hear is an opportunity to enrich someone’s life.

 - Anger, depression, guilt, and shame are the product of the thinking that is at the base of violence on our planet.

 - Labeling and diagnosis is a catastrophic way to communicate. Telling other people what’s wrong with them greatly reduces, almost to zero, the probability that we’re going to get what we’re after.
 - If we wish to express anger fully, the first step is to divorce the other person from any responsibility for our anger.
 - It’s harder to empathize with those who appear to possess more power, status, or resources.
 - Most of us grew up speaking a language that encourages us to label, compare, demand, and pronounce judgments rather than to be aware of what we are feeling and needing.
 - Everything we do is in service of our needs. When this one concept is applied to our view of others, we’ll see that we have no real enemies, that what others do to us is the best possible thing they know to do to get their needs met.
 - A need is life seeking expression within us.

 - All human actions are an attempt to meet needs.
 - To be able to hear our own feelings and needs and to empathize with them can free us from depression.
 - We’re not taught to think in terms of needs. We don’t make nice dead people when we’re in touch with needs. Domination structures cannot maintain themselves when citizens are educated to be alive.
 - I try never to hear what another person thinks of me. I enjoy life a lot more when I spend as little time as possible hearing or thinking about what other people think about me. I go to the needs behind the thoughts. Then I’m in a different world.

 - There are the two main reasons we don’t get our needs met. First, we don’t know how to express our needs to begin with and second if we do, we forget to put a clear request after it, or we use vague words like appreciate, listen, recognize, know, be real, and stuff like that.
 - NVC self-forgiveness: connecting with the need we were trying to meet when we took the action that we now regret.
 - Conventional compliments often take the form of judgments however positive, and are sometimes offered to manipulate the behavior of others. NVC encourages the expression of appreciation solely for celebration.

 - You’ll find people less threatening if you hear what they’re needing rather than what they’re thinking about you.
 - I find that my cultural conditioning leads me to focus attention on places where I am unlikely to get what I want. I developed NVC as a way to train my attention-to shine the light of consciousness-on places that have the potential to yield what I am seeking.
 - Two things distinguish nonviolent actions from violent actions. First, you don’t see an enemy and second, your intention is not to make the other side suffer.
 - To practice NVC, it’s critical for me to be able to slow down, take my time, to come from an energy I choose, the one I believe that we were meant to come from, not the one I was programmed into.
 - This language is from the head. It is a way of mentally classifying people into varying shades of good and bad, right and wrong. Ultimately, it provokes defensiveness, resistance, and counterattack. It is a language of demands.
 - When I am angry I have a judgment and an unmet need.
 - Blaming and punishing others are superficial expressions of anger.
 - Most of us live in a Jackal world where we take turns using the other person as a waste basket for our words.

 - NVC is interested in learning that is motivated by reverence for life, by a desire to learn skills, to contribute better to our own well-being and the well-being of others.
 - Keep in mind that other people’s actions can never ‘make’ you feel any certain way. Feelings are your warning indicators.
 - The spirituality that we need to develop for social change is one that mobilizes us for social change.
 - It’s really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life.

 - I think that there is a problem with rewards and consequences because in the long run, they rarely work in the ways we hope. In fact, they are likely to backfire.
 - We are dangerous when we are not conscious of our responsibility for how we behave, think, and feel.
 - Fear of corporal punishment obscures children’s awareness of the compassion underlying the parent’s demands.
 - When we make mistakes, we can use the process of NVC mourning and self-forgiveness to show us where we can grow instead of getting caught up in moralistic self-judgments.
 - Anger can be a wonderful wake up call to help you understand what you need and what you value.
 - Don’t hate the circumstance, you may miss the blessing.
 - We are responsible for what we hear other people say and for how we act.
 - Also, think about your intentionality – are you getting lost in the method? or coming from the intentionality, the purpose? You don’t want to do the mechanics without the consciousness.

 - Any time you throw pain at a Jackal without a clear present request, within a millisecond he’ll jump in.
 - Thinking based on who deserves what blocks compassionate communication.
 - I don’t think you can have an authentic connection when one person is diagnosing the other.
 - Once you have access to key people in an organization, if you go into a meeting with enemy images of those people – then you are not going to connect.
 - Our goal is to create a quality of empathic connection that allows everyone’s needs to be met.
 - Empathize, rather than put your “but” in the face of an angry person.
 - As NVC replaces our old patterns of defending, withdrawing or attacking in the face of judgment and criticism. We come to perceive ourselves and others, as well as our intentions and relationships, in a new light. Resistance, defensiveness, and violent reactions are minimized.
 - Before we tackle the gangs and the basic story, we have to make sure that we have liberated ourselves from how we have been educated and make sure we are coming from a spirituality of our own choosing.
 - Learning is too precious to be motivated by coercive tactics.
 - Our ability to offer empathy can allow us to stay vulnerable, defuse potential violence, help us hear the word ‘no’ without taking it as a rejection, revive lifeless conversation, and even hear the feelings and needs expressed through silence.
 - When I recognize I’ve got anger, then I realize it’s because I have a need that’s not being met.

 - My need is for safety, fun and to have distribution of resources, a sustainable life on the planet. NVC is a strategy that serves me to meet these needs.
 - When we listen for feelings and needs – we can see that people who seem like monsters are simply human beings whose language and behavior sometimes keep us from seeing their humanness.
 - We want people to change because they see better ways of meeting their needs at less cost, not because of fear that we’re going to punish them, or ‘guilt’ them if they don’t. This applies to ourselves as well.

 - NVC is a way of keeping our consciousness tuned in moment by moment to the beauty within ourselves.

 - Miracles can happen when we can keep our consciousness away from analyzing and classifying one another.
 - Every message, regardless of form or content, is an expression of a need.
 - We give empathy to others for our own benefit.
 - Needs are never conflicting. When we say that, we are only saying that at the moment we aren’t seeing how both needs can be met. That leaves an opening. When you think in the way I’m suggesting, you’ll often find a way to get most needs met simultaneously.

 - If the other persons behavior is not in harmony with my own needs, the more I empathize with them and their needs, the more likely I am to get me own needs met.
 - The best way I can get understanding from another person is to give this person the understanding, too. If I want them to hear my needs and feelings, I first need to empathize.
