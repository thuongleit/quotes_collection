 - Just because life is hard, and always ends in a bad way, doesn’t mean that all stories have to, even if that’s what they tell us in school and in the New York Times Review. In fact, it’s a good thing that stories are as different as we are, one from another.
 - The subject for a lot of non-fiction is very emotional, but if you read it, it’s the most boring, dry stuff. I wanted ‘Torn Apart’ to be extremely accessible and readable.

 - What was premeditated murder if not calculated leverage?

 - Besides my great fashion sense? I play a mean harmonica.
 - When your own romantic life is falling apart, everyone else’s looks fabulous.
 - Just for fun I flew in huge banking arcs, taking deep breaths, enjoying the feel of my newly weightless hair. The stylist had called it “wind tossed.” If only she knew.

 - What, eBay isn’t good enough for us?
 - I have a folder in my office with about 400 ideas in it. So it will take me another 40 years to get through those.

 - When I wanted information, it was silent; when I didn’t want to hear from it, it got chatty. It was alost as irritating as Fang.
 - Other than my hundreds of arrests I really don’t have that much experience with the law. While the majority of people aren’t corrupt, there certainly is an awful lot of corruption in this country.
 - Fang looked at the newest bird kid. Dylan was an inch or two taller than he was, and somewhat heavier built, though he still had the long, lean look of a human-avian hybrid-you couldn’t make bricks fly.
 - I’ll just ask now: What is it about my persona that draws every insane, power-hungry nutcase to me like a magnet?
 - Even needing to get to Angel, we couldn’t forget the basic necessity of eating.
 - Fang. I had to do some thinking about him. Me. I had some thinking to do about me too.
 - Fnick -Iggy.
 - Ari smiled. The sun was shining, the weather was great, he was eating ice cream, and all his dreams were about to come true.
 - Louisiana, the state road maintenance forgot.
 - I think e-books are terrific in their own right. I love being able to get on a plane and basically carry around seven books and it weigh 10 ounces.
 - Okay, okay, okay. I understood that pushing the elevator button over and over again would not make the elevator appear sooner. But I couldn’t help myself.
 - He gives my hand a tight squeeze, but that desperation, that urgency between us is gone. No insecurities. Max and Fang. Fang and Max. No longer a question. We just are.
 - Love between two people can last a long time if the people love themselves some, and are ready to give love to another person.
 - WARNING If you dare to read this story, you become part of the Experiment.
 - My style is colloquial storytelling. It’s the way we tell stories to one another – it’s not writerly, it’s not overdone.
 - Fair isn’t fair, Dean. Like I’m supposed to help you because fair is fair? Try I need you to help me so I wont rip out your spine and beat you with it. I might respond to that, maybe.
 - Can you giggle while racing for your life and protecting a six-year-old? I can.
 - There’s nothing more annoying than cold logic and reason when you’ve got a good fit going.
 - Bizarre! That’s the only word I can use to describe life sometimes. Just freaking bizarre.
 - My mom had a soft heart after all! Instead of being chained by both wrists, we were only chained by one ankle! I mean, if I’d been looking for proof that she really did love me, this was it, right?
 - The hamster called. He wants his home back.
 - Am I tough? Am I strong? Am I hard-core? Absolutely. Did I whimper with pathetic delight when I sank my teeth into my hot fried-chicken sandwich? You betcha.
 - It is my time. The time of maximum ride...
 - That’d be just what I need: a rash of car thefts across America, committed by dedicated readers.
 - Max-Dogs, dogs, go away, let me live another day.
 - It was like meeting someone out of your dreams, or fantasies, or a beloved character from a favorite book.
 - Was this normalcy-predictable patterns, the certainty of doing the same thing everyday? Because if so, normalcy was about to make me freak out and start screaming.
 - I have a number of writers I work with regularly. I write an outline for a book. The outlines are very specific about what each scene is supposed to accomplish.

 - I don’t smile as much as I should, even though I smile inside a lot.
 - What are we but our stories?
 - Love means never having to be apart.
 - Once a bird kid, always a bird kid. – maximum ride series.
 - I won’t lie to you – it was hilarious. Yes, we were in trouble, yes, this was a disaster, and so one and so forth, but I have to say, seeing those upturned faces, the looks, was bout the best thing that happened to us since we’d come to New York.
 - I am not a great prose stylist. I’m a storyteller. There are thousands of people who don’t like what I do. Fortunately, there are millions who do.
 - Fang was going to kill me. And after I was dead, he would kill me again.
 - You’re a fridge with wings. We’re freaking ballet dancers! -Fang.
 - I grew up in a house full of women: my mother, grandmother, three sisters, and two female cats. And I still have the buzz of their conversations in my head. As an adult, I have more female friends than male ones: I just love the way that women talk.
 - Seize what’s been handed you. Make smart decisions. Make decisions because life is a temporary situation.
 - You’re lucky if you find something you like to do, and it’s a miracle if somebody will pay you to do it.
 - How is San Francisco, Alex? Lovely city. Will you leave your heart there? Do you think it’s a good place to die?
 - I did know that the book would end with a mind-boggling trial, but I didn’t know exactly how it would turn out. I like a little suspense when I am writing, too.
 - Never underestimate the power of funny, it moves mountains.
 - I looked around. As flock leader, everyone was expecting me to make a decision. Jeb’s presence here would bring uncertainty, chaos, probably danger. It would perk up my day.
 - A vet! I started laughing weakly and had to sit on the edge of the tub. A vet. Wait till they found out how appropriate that was.
 - The vampire underworld is much larger than most people could imagine. It exists in all the cities mentioned in the book, but also in many, many more. Teenagers, especially, seem to like to act out vampire fantasies.
 - Yes. I owed my life, Angel’s life, and my mother’s life to a mutant’s ability to create industrial-strength snot.
 - There’s a saying I remember from my grandmother: One today is worth two tomorrows.
 - Iggy’s spine tightened, his face like ice. When he’d been at the School, they’d tried to surgically enhance his night vision. Now he was blind forever. Oops.
 - I moved to leave, and Dylan actually grabbed me by my shoulders. I was so surprised that I forgot to karate-chop his elbows and break his arms.
 - Tears were dripping onto my dress, but I wasn’t making any sound. There was no sound to express thid kind of pain. I didn’t want to move, didn’t want to do anything. Fang was not waiting for me out in the living room. Tomorrow morning, when I woke up, Fang would still be gone.
 - I had to give him props, but how annoying of him to be a hero when I was trying so hard to dislike him. It was downright selfish.
 - On the other hand, even a big, ’80s love van was less noticeable than six flying kids and their talking dog. So there you go.
 - Jeezum – humans were like eggshells.
 - Sometimes when you’re at your most certain, that’s when everything you know is wrong.
 - I gave him a kick and he stepped back onto the third rail. Exploding, flaming eraser! This is why moms tell you to stay away from the third rail, but it sure came in handy this time.
 - Call me crazy, but there’s just something cheering about seeing huge raptors tear into Eraser flesh.
 - I stood my ground. “You evil scientist are all the same – evil. Count me out.” Fang and I brushed past Mr. God and walked quickly but smoothly to the exit. It was barely noon, and I’d already made a huge enemy. Dang, I’m good.
 - They’re afraid of change, and we must change. They’re afraid of the young, and we are the young. They’re afraid of music, and music is our life. They’re afraid of books, and knowledge, and ideas. They’re most afraid of our magic.
 - It’s our job – as parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles – to find books our kids are going to like.
 - Every other person in the world would have looked at it and thought, Max would hate this. It was girly. It was beautiful. It wasn’t made of titanium and black leather with spikes on it. But it seemed exactly right, in a weird, heart-fluttery kind of way. And I really loved it.
 - In the dictionary, next to the word stress, there is a picture of a midsize mutant stuck inside a dog crate, wondering if her destiny is to be killed or to save the world. Okay, not really. But there should be.
 - Did I want a dog? No. Did I need a dog? Also no. We were six kids running for our lives, not knowing where our next meal was coming from. Could we afford to feed a dog? Wait for it – no.
 - Honesty is always good, except when it’s better to lie.
 - Here’s a freebie: Don’t play poker with a kid who can read minds.

 - The trick to having obedient, unquestioning children was to have death be the other option.
 - I knew how good love could be – I knew it was the best thing I’d ever done in my life – and yet here I was alone. I was taking chances with my life. I kept telling everybody that I was all right, but I wasn’t.
 - You mean other than the wings? I once ate nine snicker bars in a row without barfing. It was a record.
 - Some kids get called ‘bundles of joy’ or ‘slices of heaven’ or ‘dreams come true.’ We got ‘the fifty-fourth generation of DNA experiments.’ Doesn’t have the same warm and fuzzy feel. But maybe I’m oversensitive.
 - I love Nudge, Nudge is a great kid, but that motormouth of hers could have turned Mother Teresa into an ax murderer.
 - Our parents were a test tube and a turkey baster.
 - Some poeple just don’t have what it takes to appreciate a cookie.

 - What kind of thoughtless creep would burn a book?
 - Angel: What’s sauerkraut? Max: You don’t want it. Trust me.
 - People always come up to me and say, ‘you should do standup.’ It’s nice to discover things about yourself. That keeps everything lively and fun.
 - Another day. Get up and face it.
 - Yes, I sounded like a pathetic weenie. I prefer to think of it as showing my softer side.
 - Actually, I’d already briefed him, early this morning. Since we were up at six. Since, at six, the nurse had been overcome with the overwhelming compulsion to take Fang’s temperature right then.
 - What are you guys doing? If you anted me to take a shower, all you had to do was pay me ten bucks, like you usually do.
 - Blood City III: The Massacre. I’d read the summary of it online, and frankly, it sounded like the directors had just decided to film my life.
 - I hoped I wasn’t actually dead. That would make finding our parents and saving the world really hard.
 - I’m not a writer’s writer. I’m not a craftsman. I could be, and that would be a one-book-a-year operation.
 - I guess I write four or five hours a day, but I do it seven days a week. It’s very disciplined, yes, but it’s joy for me.
 - Can I come in? No! I’m in a towel! I’m blind!
 - Yeah, well, asparagus is good for me, but it still makes me want to throw up.
 - When its true, when it’s right, love can give you the kind of joy that you can’t get from any other experience.
 - If Fang is in any way harmed while I’m gone-if he gets a hangnail-you won’t see another morning. Are we clear on that?
 - I’m pretty sure that if you looked up the word “nuts” in the dictionary, you’ll find my picture. Just another fun feature of my mutant-birdkid-freak package.
 - A good love story always keeps the pot boiling.
 - I led the way toward the crowd, trying to look casual, like, Fly? Me? Nah.
 - At that moment I had no mind to change, or not change, or throw against the nearest wall.
 - Gazzy sniffed the air. “That’s explosives. It smells like Christmas!” Okay, so we’ve had somewhat untraditional Christmases. With explosives.
 - Hollywood is a peculiar beast – people in Hollywood are nuts.
 - Right there, in front of everyone, I threw my arms arond his neck and mashed my mouth against his. He was startled for a second, then his strong arms wraped around me so tightly I could hardly breathe. “ZOMG,” I heard Nudge whisper.
 - If your going to look back on something and laugh about it, you might as well laugh about it now.
 - What’s so funny ’bout peace, love, and world destruction?
 - Time to die. -Evil Angel.
 - I love to tell stories. It’s a delight for me.
 - There’s always be a me and you.
 - Excuse me? I’m alive too.
 - A guy who hates his job isn’t going to be too charming at home.
 - I love the idea of expanding the universe of games to some extent. At one point, they were kind of limited to boys, fanboys and whatever. I like the idea of liberation for games.
 - Max-I’m not going to die today.
 - Maybe he was a good a good whitecoat – like Jeb. And maybe the moon was made of cream cheese.
 - You love him so much it feels like you can’t go on without him. You feel like you might die without him.
 - I remembered something my first partner had told me. Never wrestle with a pig, Lindsay. You both get dirty. The pig likes it.
 - We try not to encourage demonstrations of his mastery of the gaseous arts.
 - For many years I had heard about an underworld consisting of people who act out a vampire fantasy while I was living in New York. Fortunately for me there are also several books on the phenomena.
 - I was always a good student, but I didn’t read that much until I was 18 and I was working my way through college.

 - Just in case you thought elephants were all sweetness, I can attest to the fact that this one had the time of her life scaring the bejeezus out of those dudes.
 - There’s nothing more dangerous than than someone trying to act for the greater good.
 - Please, I begged silently, please do not let my last moments on earth be me crammed into a tiny boat in the dark, surrounded by mechanical singing pirates.
 - You know things have gone bad when military marches pass for pop music.
 - It was a pretty complete list. The kind of list one makes when one cannot fall asleep because one’s thoughts keep swirling through one’s brain like a bunch of sparrows on crack.
 - Oh great. Yoda captured us.
 - Are you fangalicious? -Jess, a random blogger I could never be as fangalicious as you’d want me to be.-Fang.
 - Fang felt a cold jolt, then dismissed it. Max wasn’t dead. He would know, somehow. He would have felt it. The world still felt the same to him; therefore, Max was still in it.
 - If you’re in the room, I want to be next to you. If you’re gone, I think about you. You’re who I want to talk to. In a fight, I want you at my back. When we’re together the sun is shining. When we’re apart, everything is in shades of gray.
 - I don’t believe in lecturing people. It’s much more effective to present reading as a fun, rewarding pastime.
 - Nowhere will you meet more interesting people than in books.
 - Advice: Don’t wait until someone you have issues with – especially someone you’re related to – gets shot before you work it out.
 - I don’t think of myself as a writer.
 - Yes, Max, you are going to die. Just like everybody else. Thank you, Confucious.
 - Do I open it? Do I open it? Of course I freaking open it!
