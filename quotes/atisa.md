 - The greatest effort is not concerned with results.
 - The greatest meditation is a mind that lets go.
 - See all living beings as your father or mother, and love them as if you were their child.
 - Avoid places that disturb your mind, and always remain where your virtues increase.
 - The highest nobility lies in taming your own mind.
