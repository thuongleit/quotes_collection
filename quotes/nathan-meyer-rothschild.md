 - Buy when the cannons are firing, and sell when the trumpets are blowing.
 - We are like the mechanism of a watch: each part is essential.
 - Who controls the issuance of money controls the government!
 - As long as a house is like yours, and as long as you work together with your brothers, not a house in the world will be able to compete with you, to cause you harm or to take advantage of you, for together you can undertake and perform more than any house in the world.
