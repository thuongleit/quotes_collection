 - I follow four dictates: face it, accept it, deal with it, then let it go.
 - Be soft in your practice. Think of the method as a fine silvery stream, not a raging waterfall.
 - If moment by moment you can keep your mind clear then nothing will confuse you.
 - Do not ask for less responsibility to be free and relaxed-ask for more strength!
 - Those who do not have faith in others will not be able to stand on their own.
