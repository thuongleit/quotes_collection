 - I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other. Because through dance I have experienced the wordless joy of freedom, I seek it more fully now for my people and for all people everywhere.
 - The dance is strong magic. The body can fly without wings. It can sing without voice. The dance is strong magic. The dance is life.
