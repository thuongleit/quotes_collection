 - Design cannot rescue failed content.
 - If the statistics are boring, you’ve got the wrong numbers.
 - Good design is a lot like clear thinking made visual.
 - The world is generally multivariate.
 - If you’re told what to look for, you can’t see anything else.
 - Good design is clear thinking made visible, bad design is stupidity made visible.
 - In general, I think audiences are a lot smarter than people think. So, it’s not “know your audience”, it’s “respect your audience, and really know your content”.
 - Graphical excellence is that which gives to the viewer the greatest number of ideas in the shortest time with the least ink in the smallest space.
 - Beautiful Evidence is about the theory and practice of analytical design.
 - PowerPoint is like being trapped in the style of early Egyptian flatland cartoons rather than using the more effective tools of Renaissance visual representation.
 - Clutter and confusion are failures of design, not attributes of information.
 - An open mind but not an empty head.
 - The minimum we should hope for with any display technology is that it should do no harm.
 - Confusion and clutter are failures of design, not attributes of information. And so the point is to find design strategies that reveal detail and complexity – rather than to fault the data for an excess of complication. Or, worse, to fault viewers for a lack of understanding.
 - I was writing a chapter of Beautiful Evidence on the subject of the sculptural pedestal, which led to my thinking about what’s up on the pedestal – the great leader.
 - Science and art have in common intense seeing, the wide-eyed observing that generates empirical information.
 - The leading edge in evidence presentation is in science; the leading edge in beauty is in high art.
 - A metaphor for good information design is a map. Hold any diagram against a map and see how it compares.
 - Design isn’t crafting a beautiful, textured button with breathtaking animation. It’s figuring out if there’s a way to get rid of the button altogether.
 - The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly – to develop strategies of seeing and showing.
 - If you like overheads, you’ll love PowerPoint.
 - The most common user action on a Web site is to flee.
 - There are many true statements about complex topics that are too long to fit on a PowerPoint slide.
 - Here’s the general theory: To clarify, add detail. Imagine that. To clarify, add detail. And clutter and overload are not an attribute of information, they are failures of design. If the information is in chaos, don’t start throwing out information, instead fix the design.
 - My father worked for governments all his life as an engineer and public works director.
 - Clutter is not a property of information. Clutter is a failure of design.
 - What this means is that we shouldn’t abbreviate the truth but rather get a new method of presentation.
 - It is straightforward for me to be ethical, responsible, and kind-hearted because I have the resources to support that.
 - Audience boredom is usually a content failure, not a decoration failure.
 - Make all visual distinctions as subtle as possible, but still clear and effective.
 - It is not how much empty space there is, but rather how it is used. It is not how much information there is, but rather how effectively it is arranged.
 - The essential test of design is how well it assists the understanding of the content, not how stylish it is.
 - If your words or images are not on point, making them dance in color won’t make them relevant.
 - PowerPoint presentations too often resemble a school play – very loud, very slow, and very simple.
 - The idea is that the content is the interface, the information is the interface, not computer-administrative debris.
 - The goal is to provide analytical tools that will last students a lifetime.
 - The best graphics are about the useful and important, about life and death, about the universe. Beautiful graphics do not traffic with the trivial.
 - Great design is not democratic; it comes from great designers. If the standard is lousy, then develop another standard.
 - The point of the essay is to change things.
 - I think it is important for software to avoiding imposing a cognitive style on workers and their work.
 - The world is much more interesting than any one discipline.
 - That is to say, nature’s laws are causal; they reveal themselves by comparison and difference, and they operate at every multivariate space, time point.
 - Allowing artist-illustrators to control the design and content of statistical graphics is almost like allowing typographers to control the content, style, and editing of prose.
 - What gets left out is the narrative between the bullets, which would tell us who’s going to do what and how we’re going to achieve the generic goals on the list.
 - The idea of trying to create things that last-forever knowledge-has guided my work for a long time now.
 - My idea here is that, inasmuch as certain cognitive tasks and principles are tied to nature’s laws, these tasks and principles are indifferent to language, culture, gender, or the particular mode of information that is provided.
 - What is to be sought in designs for the display of information is the clear portrayal of complexity. Not the complication of the simple; rather the task of the designer is to give visual access to the subtle and the difficult – that is, revelation of the complex.
 - I am certainly not an intellectual relativist, nor a moral relativist.
 - The speculative part of my work is that these particular cognitive tasks – ways of thinking analytically – are tied to nature’s laws.
 - I hope that I am generous and tolerant, but certainly on the intellectual side I think that there are discoverable truths, and some things that are closer approximations to the truth than others.
 - I do believe that there are some universal cognitive tasks that are deep and profound – indeed, so deep and profound that it is worthwhile to understand them in order to design our displays in accord with those tasks.
 - A practical part of my teaching is to provide demonstrative, hands-on experiences.
 - We’ve drifted into this presentation mode without realizing the cost to the content and the audience in the process.
 - A curious consequence is that I have become a minor celebrity.
