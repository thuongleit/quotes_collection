 - Traveling is like flirting with life. It’s like saying, ‘I would stay and love you, but I have to go; this is my station.’
 - My head was a desolate place and as barren as the bare hills of Le Marche. Until I began to build in it, only vultures nested there.
 - I knew, as every peasant does, that land can never be truly owned. We are the keepers of the soil, the curators of trees.
