 - No one gets remembered for the things they didn’t do.
 - Love is about all the changes you make, and not just three small words.
 - I still believe in the need for guitars and drums and desperate poetry.
 - We’re definitely going to hell. But we’ll have all the best stories to tell.
 - The bands I like, they don’t sell too many records and the girls I like, they don’t kiss too many boys. Books I read will never be bestsellers yeah but come on fellas at least we made our choice.
 - Because the only thing that punk rock should ever really mean, is not sitting ’round and waiting for the lights to go green.
