 - It’s time you realized that you have something in you more powerful and miraculous than the things that affect you and make you dance like a puppet.
 - To the wise, life is a problem; to the fool, a solution.

 - You are a little soul carrying about a corpse, as Epictetus used to say.
 - Never value anything as profitable to thyself which shall compel thee to break thy promise, to lose thy self-respect, to hate any man, to suspect, to curse, to act the hypocrite, to desire anything which needs walls and curtains.
 - Take the shortest route. The one that nature planned – to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculations and pretension.
