 - If you want to protect yourself as an actor, always work with good people.
 - If you’re famous, I don’t – for the life of me – I don’t understand why any famous person would ever be on Twitter. Why on God’s green earth would you be on Twitter? Because first of all, the worst thing you can do is make yourself more available, right?

 - It’s not that I lead this oblivious life where I think I’ve got such a great personality that people want to spend time with me. If someone has a poster of you or asks for your autograph, clearly you can’t take them out on a date. It’s not that interesting if someone is just interested in you.
 - In the ’60s, when I was growing up, one of the great elements of American culture was the protest song. There were songs about the civil rights movement, the women’s rights movement, the antiwar movement. It wasn’t just Bob Dylan, it was everybody at the time.
 - I enjoy living in a nice house and having a nice life. So I do two or three commercials overseas a year to sort of fill in, because they pay pretty well.
 - I love children and I get along with them great. It’s just that I believe if you’re going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, ‘I want a family.’ I don’t feel that sense of urgency.
 - Even other movies I wasn’t involved with, I’d watch them edit ’cause I really enjoy watching them go through their process. It’s a very economical, educational process.
 - I love my grey hair and wrinkles. I love the fact that my face has more of an edge and more character than it did when I was in my twenties and thirties. No Botox for me.

 - The hardest thing is trying not to correct everything on the Internet. It’d be night and day – wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. So you just have to say, All right, I’ll take it, bring it on.
 - Everyone makes moral choices that better themselves and hurt someone else along the way – and whether or not the means justify the ends. And that, to me, is universal.
 - The idea that every time you do a film you’re supposed to be tortured confuses me. I mean, guys who say, ‘Oh, it’s really tough, my character is really suffering’ -come on. For us, even in the rotten ones we’ve had a good time. I don’t think you have to suffer.

 - I get asked a lot about getting into politics. I say, ‘Take a look at politics. You tell me what seems appealing about that.’

 - I don’t know of an actor that the Coen brothers would come to and say, “Hey, I’ve got a movie for you to be in, if you want to do it,” that would say, “No.” That’s the truth.
 - I grew up at a time where I think most people had a social and political conscience. Some of the biggest changes in our country’s political history happened at the time I was growing up, so I was raised to be a part of those things and to participate and I will continue to do that as much as I can.
