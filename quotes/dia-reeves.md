 - She was like the moon – part of her was always hidden away.
 - What the eyes don’t see, the heart can’t feel.
 - They can’t even decide what flavor of crazy I am.
 - I wear my cool on the inside; that’s why my hands are always so cold.
 - The rain echoed in the shadowy attic space and made me feel small and fragile, like a lace glove left behind on moving day – mateless and abandoned.
