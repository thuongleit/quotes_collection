 - Resolve was never stronger than in the morning, after the night, when it was never weaker.
 - I take no notice of the trends. It has never concerned me at all. My job is to deal with what I want to deal with and reach an audience by doing so.
 - Life is about luck and it’s about circumstances and socioeconomic conditions and all the rest of it, but you know, you can also make choices. It’s about spirit and generosity and all the other things, too.
 - But films should be voyeuristic. What else is a film if you’re not snooping into somebody else’s lives?
 - Given the events of even the 19th century, Zionism was inevitable. Given the events of the 20th century, Israel was inevitable.
 - My work is about life as you and I experience it. You’re either lucky or you’re not lucky; either your relationship works or it doesn’t.

 - I think Michael Caine is a perfectly good actor but it’s obvious he’s not going to be in one of my films.
 - There’s a constant drip and trickle of life that goes into one’s awareness really and consciousness of things.
 - If a film or any piece of work doesn’t entertain, it fails – and that is using the word entertain literally, meaning it holds you there and you become absorbed by it so that you don’t walk away and get bored and so on.
 - My work requires acting at its most committed – it demands actors of enormous resilience, but also intelligence and wit. It doesn’t work for narcissistic or selfish actors.
 - Films are made all over the world all the time and only a thin slice of that product is Hollywood.

 - I’m developing the stuff all the time. There’s a film in my head. I’m imagining a film.

 - I am very happy to be part of European and world cinema as a British filmmaker.
 - It’s important to be true to the events, but the most important thing is to get to the essence of the experience. Not to be bogged down in an academic way by a notion of the truth. First of all, the truth is an illusive and spurious concept.
 - The whole thing about making films in an organic film on location is that it’s not all about characters, relationships and themes, it’s also about place and the poetry of place. It’s about the spirit of what you find, the accidents of what you stumble across.
 - The main problem is that the Hollywood system has already made the film before the director shoots a single frame.
 - But actually I make films that I think are extremely sophisticated and cinematic.
 - I can’t negotiate and collaborate with a character to create a distilled dramatic investigation of the raw material. I need to work with an actor. That stuff about actors who stay in character all the time is nonsense.
