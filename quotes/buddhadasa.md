 - What is the world full of? It is full of things that arise, persist, and cease. Grasp and cling to them, and they produce suffering. Don’t grasp and cling to them, and they do not produce suffering.
 - The practice is to make the non-arising of grasping and clinging absolute, final, and eternally void, so that no grasping and clinging can ever return. Just that is enough. There is nothing else to do.
 - Hell was OK, until some wise guy went to heaven and came back.
 - Happiness is when there is no hunger or want at all, when we’re completely free of all hunger, desire, and want.
 - Do work of all kinds with a mind that is void and to the voidness surrender all of the fruits.
