 - Time and silence are the most luxurious things today.
 - Everyday is one less day.
 - Dressing well is a form of good manners.
 - I think that the older you get, the more you become your true, essential self. You find the things that make you happy. You whittle away the parts of yourself that mean less to you.
 - I’m a very serious person.
 - When I am on my deathbed, I don’t think I will be thinking about a nice pair of shoes I had or my beautiful house. I am going to be thinking about an evening I spent with somebody when I was twenty where I felt that I was just absolutely connected to them.
 - I guess I’m just one of these people who, when I decide I’m going to do something, I just do it.
 - I know one day I’ll be irrelevant. No matter how hard you try there is a cultural moment, but eventually that window’s gone, your time on Earth is finished, and you might as well leave. I could absolutely die tomorrow – I would not care. I feel like I’ve lived, I feel like I’ve had a great life.

 - When you find somebody good, keep them in your life.
 - Your connections with other people are important, our connection to the earth.
 - I love to design. I am a commercial fashion designer. I always design jackets with two sleeves. I don’t design jackets with three sleeves, or the layers and layers come off like little dolls from Russia. Fashion for me is a creative endeavor, but it is not art for me.
 - You know that only thing that has made the whole thing worthwhile has been those few times that I was able to truly connect with another person.
 - I worry constantly and obsess over things, but I just don’t let fear stand in the way of doing something that I really want to do.
 - Skin bathed in summer sunset light is sultry and sublime. Every woman looks irresistible in its glow-relaxed and sensual.
 - I’m a fashion designer. What I do is artistic, but I’m not an artist because everything I do is destined to be sold. That’s not to say that you can’t be an artist and a fashion designer. I think some designers are artists.
 - I do struggle because I’m attracted to beautiful things, yet at the same time I am actually very aware, in some sense, their lack of value and that the most important things in life are your connections to other people.
 - Men don’t wear fashion any more except in Italy and London. Americans have lost that.
 - Fashion creates a bit of a dream.
 - I don’t work for money any longer. I’m fortunate enough not to need to work for money, but I work for pride; I work because I love to work, and so the idea that one could lose control of one’s own name and that things could be produced with your name on that you were not proud of scared me.
 - Only hire people you want to have dinner with.

 - Keep your jacket buttoned. Always. It’s just really flattering – it will take pounds off you.
 - You can’t fake anything. If you’re honest and true and you love something, and you put that energy into it, people can usually feel it on the other side.
 - When I come home I actually take off all my clothes, and I wear no clothes until I leave. I eat naked. I do everything completely naked.
 - The idea of losing someone that you love could throw you into a situation where you could not see your future and you really would be living in the past.
 - Advertising is, of course, important because advertise is the final design. It’s the last layer that speaks to the customer, that tells them what you have.
 - I probably do have an obsessive personality, but striving for perfection has served me well.
 - My goal is to help women to become the best version of themselves.
 - If you don’t need to quit drinking, you shouldn’t quit drinking. I used to really love to drink, and especially living in London, it’s just built for drinking...
 - A man should never wear shorts in the city. Flip-flops and shorts in the city are never appropriate. Shorts should only be worn on the tennis court or on the beach.
 - My real life’s not like the fantasy Tom Ford world – with naked girls pouring perfume everywhere. It’s more staying in and watching Friends on television.
 - You should put on the best version of yourself when you go out in the world because that is a show of respect to the other people around you.
 - My grandmother was probably the first person who I thought was beautiful. She was incredibly stylish, she had big hair, big cars. I was probably 3 years old, but she was like a cartoon character. She’d swoop into our lives with presents and boxes, and she always smelled great and looked great.
 - Real fashion change comes from real changes in real life. Everything else is just decoration.
 - I believe in living life the way that you want to live it every day, and if you do that, you don’t really need to have New Year’s resolutions.
 - The most important thing is to cleanse and moisturise your face twice a day. Use eye drops. If your eyes are white, you look healthy; you look fresh. Every man should have a magnifying mirror. If you look good magnified, you are set to go.
 - I’m a believer in fate and in fulfilling your destiny. I’ve always had a kind of inner voice that I have learned to listen to.
 - I suppose, yes, I’ve been guilty of provocation but it’s also just common sense marketing – put a bottle of scent in a woman’s cleavage, or between her thighs – and men will notice.
 - When I was a little kid, all I wanted to do was to escape what I thought was the country and get to a city. Probably film and television had influenced me so much, I really thought the key to happiness was living a very artificial life in a penthouse in New York with martini glasses.
 - We have to have genius creative thoughts precisely four times a year and on exact dates. I actually write them on my calendar. I write, ‘Friday, Nov. 8. Three o’clock. Have a genius creative idea.’
 - Style. People talk about it being stylish and beautiful, that’s at the service of the story. Style for me means nothing without substance and there are moments and things about the film that are stylish but hopefully at the service of the story.
 - A lot of people think a high armhole is restrictive, but it gives you total movement because it’s cut right up to your arm.
 - I was bullied every day at school because I carried a briefcase. I could have left it at home. But I thought it looked great! I didn’t understand why anyone else didn’t think so.
 - I’m not designing clothes for someone who is doing lines of coke off the table, like I was when I was at Gucci and Saint Laurent.
 - What’s so wrong with vanity? It’s different from narcissism, you know? It’s not about admiring yourself-it’s about taking pride in your appearance.
 - I haven’t had any plastic surgery – despite what people think, this is my nose. I have had Restylane and Botox, but I don’t think of that as plastic surgery any more.
 - I never want to retire until the day I drop dead. I want to work and work and work because work, I don’t do for money, I do for love. And I love to work.
 - A good trick as you get older is to get a thick pair of glasses that have a dark frame. Everything else can droop and slide but that pair of dark glasses stays sharp and crisp. Look at Cary Grant. Look at Vidal Sassoon.
 - I think that monogamy is artificial. I do not think it’s something that comes naturally to us.
 - I thought I was fabulous and everyone else was stupid.
 - At home, off-duty, I wear T-shirts from Fruit of the Loom – but I have them tailored.
 - I think people are sick of trends changing every six months – not because we’re tired of them, but just for the sake of change. There is so much junk in the world: junk TV, junk movies, all those junk magazines with the same people on the cover.
 - Just like girls need to learn to be comfortable in heels before they go out in them for the first time, a man should try wearing a suit throughout a normal day. I do most things in a suit-and sometimes even in a tuxedo-and so I’m really comfortable in one.
 - If I’m sending emails, and I get all wound up and stressed and don’t know what to do with myself for 20 minutes, I just go soak in hot water and lie there, thinking, ‘What should I do?’ So it’s meditative.
 - I don’t believe in playing around much with suit cuts. I like a fairly classic shape that gives a man strong shoulders, a fitted waist, and long legs. Classic simplicity always works.
 - In the early Seventies, I had shoulder-length hair, bell-bottom pants, love beads and shirts that laced up at the front. But then I smartened up.
 - Banking types should take their cue from Gordon Gekko. Or pick the best-looking banker in their firm and copy him.
 - Fashion is everything. Art, music, furniture design, graphic design, hair, makeup, architecture, the way cars look – all those things go together to make a moment in time, and that’s what excites me.
 - We live in a material world. I’m not saying that beautiful things don’t enhance our lives. But, in our culture, we’re never happy.
 - Moving fashion used to be one of my chief goals. It’s not necessarily any more. Fashion needs to change when life changes. You only need to move fashion forward when there’s a reason to move fashion forward.
 - We have the Terminator as governor, and we had an actor as president, so why shouldn’t we have a fashion designer as a senator?
 - Fashion is much more collaborative than one might think. You have to have an idea and vision and you have to communicate that vision to a team of people and you have to create an environment that allows those people to give the best that they can give.
 - I think we’re very uptight in America. You have to remember that we’re descended from Puritans. Whether or not the country is now composed of immigrants, our culture as American really begins with the landing of the Pilgrims and a puritanical view of things.
 - I don’t think fashion has to change every five minutes. I’d like these to be clothes you can wear for a long time – ten, 20 years; pass on to your daughter. Why buy vintage when you can open your own closet!
 - Certain directors are known for a certain kind of beauty; it becomes their signature.
 - I think the 1970s will always be the decade for me. Obviously, I grew up in that era, but the beauty standard was touchable, kissable.
 - I try to be nice, I try to respect other people, but over the years I’ve learned that all this stuff we do is a bunch of crap. That doesn’t mean it doesn’t have its place. We are living in a material world, so why not live with something beautiful?
 - In another life I would love to be a cosmetic surgeon because it’s architectural. You know, you are trying to figure out where the seams go. Can I do it in one piece like Halston? Can you formaldehyde DNA?
 - If my parents had discouraged me, I would have turned out very differently. They raised me in an open-minded, liberal environment.
 - Give me the control, don’t ever come on the set, and I’ll show it to you when it’s cut.
 - When I was a kid, I thought I was going to be an actor. I actually studied acting when I was at NYU, and I made a lot of television commercials – that’s actually how I put myself through NYU and through college.
 - Just because one is spiritual doesn’t mean that one doesn’t like crocodile, cashmere. We live in a material world. We still experience these things. It doesn’t mean to completely disregard them.
 - A film should be somewhat personal. I think that whatever you create you have to be true to yourself and create something that feels right to you.
 - I love fashion. What I love is the ability to express yourself, to be able to make a product and shoot an ad campaign that tosses you out into the world and lets you have a voice in contemporary culture, iconography. I felt a little bit neutered not having that voice.
 - British men are peacocks. You see a lot more style on the streets here than you see anywhere else, on every level.
 - We’ve become a little spoiled with menswear in particular because, of course, we’ve come off a period in the ’70s and ’80s when Armani, which is very soft, dominated menswear. And we’ve become obsessed with comfort. I actually don’t like that.
 - I hate tricky facial hair. If your facial hair is too spotty in places, shave. Just forget about it.

 - Perfection is almost an illness with me, but sometimes I have moments where everything is absolutely clear and you can feel, rather than think.

 - Both film and fashion are businesses where the audience doesn’t feel or see the work that goes on behind the scenes.

 - It’s really about putting that sort of quality and beauty back into our life.
 - Part of fashion is newness. It’s got to be a new combination of elements that’s shocking-stunning-beautiful all at the same time. But it doesn’t have any emotion.

 - If I had been a dog walker, I would have been the most successful dog walker in Paris.

 - In my adult life I’ve understood that if I put an enormous amount of love and honesty into something, usually that shows in the end.
 - I’m actually very introverted. I’m very shy. I’m very emotional.
 - Maybe it’s because I’m a designer, but when I am in a state of excitement, everything is so sharp and colorful and amazing, and I can look at blue and I see the yellow in it and the green in it, and the green-blues, the yellow-blues, so.
 - I went to a fashion show, and this silver-haired guy was staring at me with these piercing water-blue eyes. It scared me because I absolutely saw and knew my entire future.

 - I’m living the exact life I planned on living when I was five.
 - When I was a kid, I thought I was going to be an actor.
 - When you write a character and their dialogue, you can’t help imagining how you would be acting if you were them. You kind of have to relate to all of them. It’s the most personal thing I’ve ever done.
 - I want to make beautiful clothes for women and men who appreciate detail and quality. The product must be the best but this is almost secondary to the service the customer will receive.
 - I am not a person who is about reality. I am about enhanced reality.
 - People always ask me how I start a collection, and I tell them that I just look around. What am I tired of? What am I in the mood for? Real fashion change comes from real changes in real life. Everything else is just decoration.
 - When the youth of America gets together, amazing things happen.
 - Women are objectified in our culture. And more and more, it takes a great deal of confidence, especially as a woman, to break the mold. You know, you’re afraid that you’re going to covered in a magazine as a “fashion don’t.” That’s why you see all these girls on the red carpet looking the same.
 - It’s really never fair to judge people because none of us know what’s going on inside anyone else’s head.
 - Want girls to let you put your fingers in certain places? Get a manicure.
 - If it’s not fun, I’m not going to do it.

 - This sounds crazy, but I know so many famous people, I’m just not intimidated by anyone. I feel really comfortable with it.
 - There is no more dramatic accessory than a perfect lip. It is the focus of the face and it has the power to define a woman’s whole look.
 - My own skin-care ritual is quite simple and straightforward; I don’t like a lot of fuss, surprisingly. My products are designed to make you look and feel better. I think there are a lot of men out there who want and need the same products.
 - Fashion is harder than the film industry. You have to constantly be able to crank out hit after hit after hit on demand and on a very tight calendar. I’ve come back, I’ve lost it, I’ve come back again. It’s really as good as your last collection.
 - The dynamics of film directing and fashion design – in the ways that I’ve done it – were not dissimilar.
 - Anyone with a long-term partner, anyone with a long-term lover, if that lover dies, you could easily see yourself in a situation where you couldn’t see your future and you would be living entirely in the past. It’s about that loss.
 - Fashion is, after all, a form of escapism, and in fact people are buying more special things than ever, nowadays. They deny and deny themselves, and wait and wait, and then they get sick of it and spend to make themselves feel better.
 - Style for me is some one who figures out who they are. What works on them. What they feel good in and develops that. Develops their character. And the outer expression of their character is what is style.
 - Hips are absolutely key to every shape I do, because whatever you do at the top or bottom, you want to keep it slim and narrow on the hips. One thing is for certain: No one, man or woman, wants big hips.
 - I think people who are attracted to the fashion industry are people who are really insecure and looking for a certain identity.
 - I love black dresses. I think everyone should own a lot, but black dresses don’t sell online because on the computer they don’t read like anything.
 - I believe that when you really want to do something, you should go ahead and do it. I mean, I feel fear, but I never let that stop me.
 - I am a perfectionist. This job is a total ego thing in a way. To be a designer and say, ‘This is the way they should dress; this is the way their homes should look; this is the way the world should be.’ But then, that’s the goal: world domination through style.
 - Students in the ’60s were responsible for great changes, politically and socially.

 - Artists, like yourself, are born with a need to express that’s just innate.
 - It’s not a feminizing product; it’s designed to make your skin look better.
 - British people still wear clothes. By clothes I mean actual clothes: jackets and shirts and ties and suits. The spirit of Beau Brummell is still visible. English men make an effort. We’ve lost that in the US. Everyone is more concerned with being comfortable.
 - You have to be passionate, you have to be engaged and you have to be contributing to the world.
 - I was not good at team sports, I have to say. I’m quite good at individual sports, but I was not good at team sports, so I wasn’t good at baseball and football.
 - I think that they haven’t been able to perfect a good facelift for a man.

 - I’m very aware that when my friends and I sit around over dinner these days, the conversation invariably turns to how crass the world has become. Tweeting? It’s one of the silliest things ever.
 - Never, ever, ever wear anything you are uncomfortable in. Because that is what you’ll project: ‘I look like a fool.’
 - It’s funny, our beauty standard has become harder and tougher because we live in a tough age. I don’t think anyone wants to walk down the street and feel vulnerable. You want to walk down the street and feel like you’re in control.
 - I’m very direct. I don’t have tantrums. I don’t yell or shout. I do expect an awful lot from my staff, but no more than I expect of myself.

 - Every season, really, has their own chemistry.
 - When I was young, I wanted to be a movie star. But I realized that you have no control being an actor. So I went to architecture school in NYC, because I was crazy about buildings. Then I began to realize that I got more excited about Vogue coming out each month than I was about my projects.
 - You always notice a facelift on a woman. It’s a tightness around the ears, and the scar is usually inside the ears. If I suspect it’s been done, I usually move around until I can see it. But with a man, it actually pulls your beard and your sideburns back, and that’s what’s so strange.
 - One of my favorite teams of all time is Fran and Barry. I just thought Fran and Barry last season were just incredible and they just sort of went against all odds and were very successful.
 - If you’re at the Oscars, there’s not a man on that red carpet who is not wearing make-up. Most straight actors I know get quite used to it. Even when they go out in real life they grab some sort of bronzer and they throw it on. They dye their eyebrows, they dye their lashes – they know the tricks.
 - What is important is that we stop and realize, ‘Okay. This is fine. I can enjoy that.’ But what is really important, what I’m really going to take away with me from this life, is my connection with other people.

 - I live, I shop almost exclusively on the Internet. I’ve bought cars on the Internet. I watch television, I do everything on it. I even watch my son online.
 - I am actually extremely casual in certain environments. But one of the reasons I like living in London, I like the formality of it, as compared to the formality of America – or informality. I like putting on a suit. I like putting on a tie.
 - Style is very different from fashion. Once you find something that works, keep it.
 - As a fashion designer, I was always aware that I was not an artist, because I was creating something that was made to be sold, marketed, used, and ultimately discarded.
 - I am really a loner after all; I am really not a social person. Because of my job, people think I am out every night, but I really hate all that. I am somebody who likes to be alone and see some close friends. I am a shy and introspective person.

 - If I were straight and I were trying to seduce a woman, I could do it just by standing up at the table when she came back from the bathroom. It works. Every time I do that, all the straight men are sitting at the table and their wives are kicking them. “Look at that!” “You never do that for me!”

 - I’m a natural-born boss, I have to say. I just like to be good at things. Even as a child, I was boss of my family.
