 - Only through struggle, have I found rest.
 - Every time I’m home from tour I try to write some new songs, but it can get really hard trying to keep up with normal life, I always get so behind.
 - The more I sought truth uncorrupted by years of religious history, the more I kept finding answers I didn’t want to find. Emotionally, it would have been easiest for me to just hold on to what I grew up believing, but mentally that wasn’t an option anymore.
 - I think that people like getting their money’s worth, so it’s cool to have a load of bands in a similar genre.
 - European festivals area lot bigger than American ones, but I like the travelling festivals, it’s the same production every day and the bands get used to the stage set up and by the third or fourth show of the tour they’re putting on a better show than if they just played one day.
