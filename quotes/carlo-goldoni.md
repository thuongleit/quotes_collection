 - A wise traveller never despises his own country.
 - He only half dies who leaves an image of himself in his sons.
 - Each day a day goes by.
 - The blush is beautiful, but it is sometimes convenient.
 - The world is a beautiful book, but of little use to him who cannot read it.
 - He who never leaves his country is full of prejudices.
 - Noble bold is an accident of fortune; noble actions characterize the great.
 - He who talks much cannot talk well.
 - Pretexts are not wanting when one wishes to use them.
