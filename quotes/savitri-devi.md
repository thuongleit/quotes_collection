 - Creation and destruction are one, to the eyes who can see beauty.
 - Somebody once asked me what had attracted me to National Socialism. I replied without a shadow of hesitation: ‘Its beauty.’

 - I worship impersonal Nature, which is neither “good” or “bad”, and who knows neither love nor hatred.
