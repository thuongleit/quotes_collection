 - The legitimate function of the mind is to tell you what is not. But if you want positive knowledge, you must go beyond the mind.
 - You want to know yourself. For this keep steadily in the focus of consciousness, the only clue you have: your certainty of being. Be with it, play with it, ponder over it, delve deeply into it, till the shell of ignorance breaks open and you emerge into the realm of reality.
 - The world does not yield to changing. By its very nature it is painful and transient. See it as it is and divest yourself of all desire and fear. When the world does not hold and bind you, it becomes an abode of joy and beauty. You can be happy in the world only when you are free of it.

 - It is your restlessness that causes chaos.
 - Seeking out causes is a pastime of the mind. There is no duality of cause and effect. Everything is its own cause.

 - I am told I was born. I do not remember...
 - Do what you believe in and believe in what you do. The rest is a waste of time and energy.

 - The innermost light, shining peacefully and timelessly in the heart, is the real Guru. All others merely show the way.
 - Inquire, investigate, doubt yourself and others. To find truth, you must not cling to your convictions; if you are sure of the immediate, you will never reach the ultimate. Your idea that you were born and that you will die is absurd – both logic and experience contradict it.
 - As long as the mind is there, your body and your world are there. Your world is mind-made, subjective, enclosed within the mind, fragmentary, temporary, personal, hanging on the thread of memory.
 - Meditation will help you to find your bonds, loosen them, untie them and cast your moorings. When you are no longer attached to anything, you have done your share. The rest will be done for you.
 - Discard every self-seeking motive as soon as it is seen, and you need not search for truth; truth will find you...
 - All your desires, whatever they may be, are expressions of your longing for happiness. Basically, you wish yourself well.
 - All that happens is the cause of all that happens. Causes are numberless; the idea of a sole cause is an illusion.
 - Unless you make tremendous efforts, you will not be convinced that effort will take you nowhere. The self is so self-confident that unless it is totally discouraged it will not give up. Mere verbal conviction is not enough. Hard facts alone can show the absolute nothingness of the self-image.

 - Pure knowledge is not imparted by another; it comes unmasked. It is the one that is listening: it is your own true nature.

 - If you could only keep quiet, clear of memories and expectations, you would be able to discern the beautiful pattern of events. Its your restlessness that causes chaos.
 - The moment you know your real being, you are afraid of nothing. Death gives freedom and power. To be free in the world, you must die to the world. Then the universe is your own, it becomes your body, an expression and a tool. The happiness of being absolutely free is beyond description.
 - The problem is not yours – it is your mind’s only. Begin by disassociating yourself from your mind. Resolutely remind yourself that you are not the mind and that its problems are not yours.
 - You are already perfect, only you don’t know it. Learn to know yourself and you will discover wonders.
 - Being oneself is completely beyond all motivation. You cannot be yourself for some reason. You are yourself, and no reason is needed.
 - Leave your mind alone, that is all. Do not go along with it. After all, there is no such thing as mind apart from thoughts which come and go obeying their own laws, not yours. They dominate you only because you are interested in them.
 - The real does not die, the unreal never lived.

 - A quiet mind is all you need. All else will happen rightly, once your mind is quiet.
 - The ultimate point of view is that there is nothing to understand, so when we try to understand, we are only indulging in acrobatics of the mind. Whatever you have understood, you are not. Why are you getting lost in concepts? You are not what you know, you are the knower.
 - Cooperate with your destiny, don’t go against it, don’t thwart it. Allow it to fulfill itself.
 - When pain is accepted for what it is, a lesson and a warning, and deeply looked into and heeded, the separation between pain and pleasure breaks down, both become just experience – painful when resisted, joyful when accepted.
 - Do not neglect this body. This is the house of God; take care of it, only in this body can God be realized.

 - The silence before the words were spoken, is it different from the silence that came after?
 - Deepen and broaden your awareness of yourself and all the blessings will flow. You need not seek anything, all will come to you most naturally and effortlessly.
 - All will happen as you want it, provided you really want it.
 - Freedom is from something. What are you to be free from? Obviously, you must be free from the person you take yourself to be, for it is the idea you have of yourself that keeps you in bondage.
 - When you know beyond all doubting that the same life flows through all that is, and you are that life, you will love all naturally and spontaneously.

 - I ask you what is the taste of your mouth all you can do is to say: it is neither sweet nor bitter, nor sour nor astringent; it is what remains when all these tastes are not. Similarly, when all distinctions and reactions are no more, what remains is reality, simple and solid.
 - It is not the right advice that liberates, but the action based on it.

 - Knowledge gives power. In practice it is very simple. To control yourself, know yourself.
 - You are so used to the support of concepts that when your concepts leave you, although it is your true state, you get frightened and try to cling to them again.

 - You cannot transcend what you do not know. To go beyond yourself, you must know yourself.

 - There is in the body, a current of energy, affection and intelligence, which guides, maintains and energizes the body. Discover that current and stay with it.

 - Just be. Let your true nature emerge. Don’t disturb your mind with seeking.
 - The real is behind and beyond words, incommunicable, directly experienced, explosive in its effect on the mind. It is easily had when nothing else is wanted.
