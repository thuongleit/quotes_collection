 - My yoke is easy, and my burden light.
 - Let us trust in Him who has placed this burden upon us. What we ourselves cannot bear let us bear with the help of Christ. For He is all-powerful, and He tells us: ‘My yoke is easy, and my burden light.’
 - The Church is like a great ship being pounded by the waves of life’s different stresses. Our duty is not to abandon ship, but to keep her on her course.
 - O Lord, you have been our refuge in all generations.
