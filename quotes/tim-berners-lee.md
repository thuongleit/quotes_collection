 - I suppose it’s amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don’t work.
 - When you go onto the internet, if you really rummage around randomly then how do you hope to find something of any of value?

 - Now, if someone tries to monopolize the Web, for example pushes proprietary variations on network protocols, then that would make me unhappy.
 - Web applications will become more and more ubiquitous throughout our human environment, with walls, automobile dashboards, refrigerator doors all serving as displays giving us a window onto the Web.

 - People keep asking me what I think of it now that it’s done. Hence my protest: The Web is not done!
