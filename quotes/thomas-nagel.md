 - Consciousness is what makes the mind-body problem really intractable.
 - What is it like to be a bat? What is it like for a bat to be a bat?
 - The more details we learn about the chemical basis of life and the intricacy of the genetic code, the more unbelievable the standard historical account becomes.
 - Humans are addicted to the hope for a final reckoning, but intellectual humility requires that we resist the temptation to assume that tools of the kind we now have are in principle sufficient to understand the universe as a whole.
 - Life may be not only meaningless but absurd.
 - Philosophy is the childhood of the intellect, and a culture that tries to skip it will never grow up.
 - If sub specie aeternitatis there is no reason to believe that anything matters, then that does not matter either, and we can approach our absurd lives with irony instead of heroism or despair.
 - Perhaps the belief in God is the belief that the universe is intelligible, but not to us.

 - Everything, living or not, is constituted from elements having a nature that is both physical and nonphysical – that is, capable of combining into mental wholes. So this reductive account can also be described as a form of panpsychism: all the elements of the physical world are also mental...
 - Altruism itself depends on a recognition of the reality of other persons, and on the equivalent capacity to regard oneself as merely one individual among many.
 - It seems to me that, as it is usually presented, the current orthodoxy about the cosmic order is the product of governing assumptions that are unsupported, and that it flies in the face of common sense.

 - Common sense doesn’t have the last word in ethics or anywhere else, but it has, as J. L. Austin said about ordinary language, the first word: it should be examined before it is discarded.
 - Materialism is incomplete even as a theory of the physical world, since the physical world includes conscious organisms among its most striking occupants.
 - There is a tendency to seek an objective account of everything before admitting its reality.
 - Eventually, I believe, current attempts to understand the mind by analogy with man-made computers that can perform superbly some of the same external tasks as conscious beings will be recognized as a gigantic waste of time.
 - Absurdity is one of the most human things about us: a manifestation of our most advanced and interesting characteristics.
 - Without consciousness the mind-body problem would be much less interesting. With consciousness it seems hopeless.

 - It is prima facie highly implausible that life as we know it is the result of a sequence of physical accidents together with the mechanism of natural selection.
 - Each of our lives is a part of the lengthy process of the universe gradually waking up and becoming aware of itself.
