 - Everything is art. Everything is politics.
 - Creativity is the power to reject the past, to change the status quo, and to seek new potential. Simply put, aside from using one’s imagination – perhaps more importantly – creativity is the power to act.
 - A small act is worth a million thoughts.
 - Creativity is part of human nature. It can only be untaught.
 - Maybe being powerful means to be fragile.
 - Creativity is the power to act.
 - To express yourself needs a reason, but expressing yourself is the reason.
 - Life is art. Art is life. I never separate it.
 - The world is a sphere, there is no East or West.

 - I think my stance and my way of life is my most important art.
 - I think optimism is whether you are still exhilarated by life, whether you are curious, whether you still believe there is possibility.
 - Life is never guaranteed to be safe, so we better use it while we are still in good condition.
 - The Internet is uncontrollable. And if the Internet is uncontrollable, freedom will win. It’s as simple as that.
 - Being an artist is more of a mindset, a way of seeing things; it is no longer so much about producing something.
 - As a human being, member of society, you must clearly state your mind. It’s a responsibility. It is the way you identify yourself otherwise you don’t know who you are and why you are here.
 - The American experience influenced my understanding of individuality, basic human rights, freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens.
 - I want people to see their own power.
 - Everyone wants an iPhone, but it would be impossible to design an iPhone in China because it’s not a product; it’s an understanding of human nature.
 - Self-censorship is insulting to the self. Timidity is a hopeless way forward.
 - No outdoor sports can be more elegant than throwing stones at autocracy; no melees can be more exciting than those in cyberspace.
 - Whenever there is injustice, there is tension. But in China it is very hard to release your anger unless you burn yourself or you jump from a bridge. In a society where there is no freedom of the press, it is difficult for victims to be noticed.
 - When you have strict censorship of the internet, young students cannot receive a full education. Their view of the world is imbalanced. There can be no true discussion of the issues.
 - Art is always about overcoming obstacles between the inner condition and the skill for expression.
 - In a society that restricts individual freedoms and violates human rights, anything that calls itself creative or independent is a pretence. It is impossible for a totalitarian society to create anything with passion and imagination.
 - Everyone of us is a potential convict.
 - I think of art as coming from daily life, daily experience. I think it’s very important not to have it become work for some kind of elite circle.
 - I think it’s a responsibility for any artist to protect freedom of expression and to use any way to extend this power.
 - If there is no freedom of expression, then the beauty of life is lost. Participation in a society is not an artistic choice, it’s a human need.
 - If a nation cannot face its past, it has no future.
 - Without freedom of speech, there is no modern world, just a barbaric one.
 - The art always wins. Anything can happen to me, but the art will stay.
 - I have to find a place for my own. I have to search for my own happiness.
 - Technology is a liberation. I think the information age probably is the best thing to happen to the human race in human evolution. Now you have the equal opportunity to equip yourself through information and knowledge and express yourself as an independent mind.
 - If my art has nothing to do with people’s pain and sorrow, what is ‘art’ for?
 - I’m a free man now, except I cannot leave China. You know, I have no desire to travel. I have so many things to do; I cannot finish them now.
 - The misconception of totalitarianism is that freedom can be imprisoned. This is not the case. When you constrain freedom, freedom will take flight and land on a windowsill.
 - When human beings are scared and feel everything is exposed to the government, we will censor ourselves from free thinking. That’s dangerous for human development.
 - Imagine one day, the hateful world around you collapses. And it is your attitude, words and actions that put an end to it. Will you be excited?
 - If you don’t act, the danger becomes stronger.
 - The Internet changes the structure of society all the time – this massiveness made of individuals.
 - If artists cannot speak up for human dignity or rights, then who else will do it?
 - I am very much interested in the so-called useless object. I mean, it takes perfect craftsmanship, beautiful material carefully measured and crafted, but at the same time it’s really useless.
 - Stupidity can win for a moment, but it can never really succeed because the nature of humans is to seek freedom. Rulers can delay that freedom, but they cannot stop it.
 - Art should live in the heart of the people. Ordinary people should have the same ability to understand art as anybody else. I don’t think art is elite or mysterious.
 - Say what you say plainly, and then take responsibility for it.

 - Every day I’m learning something new from the practice. It’s very rewarding.
 - I wouldn’t say I’ve become more radical: I was born radical.

 - I always want people to be confused, to be shocked or realize something later.
 - During the days in detention, I thought most about the moon.
 - Freedom of speech implies the world isn’t defined. It is meaningful when people are allowed to see the world their way.
 - Censorship is saying: ‘I’m the one who says the last sentence. Whatever you say, the conclusion is mine.’ But the internet is like a tree that is growing. The people will always have the last word – even if someone has a very weak, quiet voice. Such power will collapse because of a whisper.
 - I think art is a very important weapon to achieve human freedom.
 - I will never leave China, unless I am forced to. Because China is mine. I will not leave something that belongs to me in the hands of people I do not trust.
 - Life is much more interesting when you make a little bit of effort.
 - If there is no free speech, every single life has lived in vain.
 - As a person, I was born to give out my opinions. By giving out my opinions, I realize who I am. As long as I can communicate, I’m not so lonely. If I cannot travel, or do art, or have company, if they take away all my belongings, it doesn’t matter at all.
 - A nation that has no music and no fairytales is a tragedy.
 - A historical property has morals and ethics of the society that created it and it can be revived. What I mean is that we can discover new possibilities from the process of dismantling, transforming, and recreating.
 - If a society cannot even support somebody like me, then people ask: Who is under protection then? That’s why there is such support for me. It is not because I am so beautiful or I am so charming. People feel: This guy is fighting for us.
 - Historically, China is not a nation of sportsmen. We traditionally put more emphasis on being close to nature than pushing endlessly to excel. A philosophy that values tranquil contemplation of the landscape cannot easily be adapted to the Olympic slogan of ‘higher, stronger, faster.’
 - It’s always nice to share your energy with young people, the people who might not have any skills but are simply willing to be a part of it.
 - The practice of photography is no longer a means for recording reality. Instead, it has become reality itself.
 - If Shakespeare were alive today, he might be writing on Twitter.
 - I call on people to be ‘obsessed citizens,’ forever questioning and asking for accountability. That’s the only chance we have today of a healthy and happy life.
 - I think art certainly is the vehicle for us to develop any new ideas, to be creative, to extend our imagination, to change the current conditions.
 - Democracy, material wealth, and universal education are the soil upon which modernism exists.
 - You can never know what is and what is not powerful, but you can always find out what the powerful people are scared of. A state like China looks so powerful, but they are so scared of the Internet, so the Internet is more powerful than them.
 - In the ’80s, you couldn’t walk in the neighborhood without looking back to see if anyone was following you. You had your key in your hand before you got to your apartment and you’d rush in so you didn’t have to stop.
 - In an environment without public platform nor protection, the individual is the most powerful and most responsible.
 - I always want to design a frame that’s open to everyone. I don’t see art as a secret code.
 - The people who control culture in China have no culture.
 - Of course, most luxury goods in China are for corrupted officials and their relatives. And that made China become the biggest luxury-goods market. In this kind of dictatorship, in this kind of totalitarian society, it is easy to make deals that you cannot make in a democratic society.

 - In a society like this there is no negotiation, no discussion, except to tell you that power can crush you any time they want – not only you, your whole family and all people like you.
 - I have to respect my life, and free expression is part of my life. I can never really silence myself.
 - I’m not a writer, but today I think you have to be everything. As an artist you have an obligation to let people know what is on your mind and why you’re doing this.

 - We move so fast that memory is something we can only grasp.
 - For me, it is OK as long as I can breathe, as long as my heart is pumping, as long as I can express myself.

 - A city is a place that can offer maximum freedom. Otherwise it’s incomplete.
