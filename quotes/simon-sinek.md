 - You are authentic when everything you say and everything you do you ACTUALLY believe.
 - Don’t show up to prove. Show up to improve.
 - The true value of a leader is not measured by the work they do. A leader’s true value is measured by the work they inspire others to do.
 - When we tell people to do their jobs, we get workers. When we trust people to get the job done, we get leaders.
 - Fight against something and you focus on the thing you hate. Fight for something and you focus on the thing you love.
 - Leadership is neither a rank nor a title. It is a choice. The choice to provide care and protection for those for whom we are responsible.
 - When you compete against everyone else, no one wants to help you. But when you compete against yourself, everyone wants to help you.
 - Great leaders don’t see themselves as great; they see themselves as human.
 - Greatness starts with a clear vision of the future.
 - Vision is a destination – a fixed point to which we focus all effort. Strategy is a route – an adaptable path to get us where we want to go.
 - Leadership is not a license to do less. Leadership is a responsibility to do more.
 - The goal is not to be perfect by the end. The goal is to be better today.
 - The value of our lives is not determined by what we do for ourselves. The value of our lives is determined by what we do for others.

 - Hearing is listening to what is said. Listening is hearing what isn’t said.
 - There is a difference between listening and waiting for your turn to speak.
 - If you hire people just because they can do a job, they’ll work for your money. But if you hire people who believe what you believe, they’ll work for you with blood, sweat, and tears.
 - Life is beautiful not because of the things we see or do. Life is beautiful because of the people we meet.
 - The hardest part is starting. Once you get that out of the way, you’ll find the rest of the journey much easier.
 - We’d achieve more if we chase the dream instead of the competition.
 - Great leaders must have two things: a vision of the world that does not yet exist and the ability to communicate that vision clearly.
 - The cost of leadership is self-interest.
 - A boss who micromanages is like a coach who wants to get in the game. Leaders guide and support and then sit back to cheer from the sidelines.
 - Martin Luther King gave the ‘I Have a Dream’ speech, not the ‘I Have a Plan’ speech.
 - Happy employees ensure happy customers. And happy customers ensure happy shareholders – in that order.
 - There are leaders and there are those who lead. Leaders hold a position of power or influence. Those who lead inspire us.
 - A leader’s job is not to do the work for others; it’s to help others figure out how to do it themselves, to get things done and to succeed beyond what they thought possible.
 - When people are financially invested, they want a return. When people are emotionally invested, they want to contribute.
 - Bad leaders care about who is right. Good leaders care about what is right.
 - If everything goes right, we get a good experience. If everything goes wrong, we get a good story.
 - The courage of leadership is giving others the chance to succeed even though you bear the responsibility for getting things done.
 - Stand for people. Not a product or service or metric or number. If we stand for real, living, breathing people, we will change the world.
 - Success always takes help. Failure is done alone.
 - Innovation is not born from the dream, innovation is born from the struggle.
 - The next time someone starts listing all the reasons an idea won’t work or can’t happen, ask them to give 3 reasons it can.

 - It’s better to have a great team than a team of greats.

 - The most important thing to do before you die is live.
 - The leaders who get the most out of their people are the leaders who care most about their people.
 - We should invest in people not ideas. A good idea is often destroyed by bad people and good people can always make a bad idea better.
 - Safe is good for sidewalks and swimming pools, but life requires risk if we are to get anywhere.
 - Don’t quit. Never give up trying to build the world you can see, even if others can’t see it. Listen to your drum and your drum only. It’s the one that makes the sweetest sound.
 - If you don’t understand people, you don’t understand business.
 - Being driven is not the same as being passionate. Passion is a love for the journey. Drive is a need to reach the destination.

 - Leadership is not about the next election, it’s about the next generation.
 - Always plan for the fact that no plan ever goes according to plan.
 - Trust has two dimensions: competence and integrity. We will forgive mistakes of competence. Mistakes of integrity are harder to overcome.
 - I find, when you’re an optimist, life has a funny way of looking after you.

 - Self confidence is the ability to exercise restraint in the face of disrespect and still show respect in response.
 - Success is when reality catches up to your imagination.
 - Leadership is a way of thinking, a way of acting and, most importantly, a way of communicating.
 - Profit isn’t a purpose, it’s a result. To have purpose means the things we do are of real value to others.
 - I’m investing in myself, I’m investing in others and I’m investing in my cause. I know if I persist it will pay back in dividends and it always does.
 - Give someone responsibility and they will do their best. Make them accountable and they will do even better.
 - Pure pragmatism can’t imagine a bold future. Pure idealism can’t get anything done. It is the delicate blend of both that drives innovation.
 - Value is a perception not a calculation. Value is something people feel, not something we tell them they get.
 - Vision is the ability to talk about the future with such clarity it is as if we are talking about the past.
 - The more you inspire, the more people will inspire you.
 - Generosity is doing something for someone else expecting nothing in return.
 - Our vision is only actionable if we share it. Without sharing, it’s just a figment of our imagination.
 - Before we can build the world we want to live in, we have to imagine it.
 - The true price of leadership is the willingness to place the needs of others above your own. Great leaders truly care about those they are privileged to lead and understand that the true cost of the leadership privilege comes at the expense of self-interest.
 - Great leaders don’t blame the tools they are given. Great leaders work to sharpen them.
 - Intelligence looks for what is known to solve problems. Creativity looks for what is unknown to discover possibilities.
 - Progress and innovation happen when you set unrealistic goals.

 - True love is when both people think they have the better half of the deal.

 - Our courage comes from the courage of others.
 - When we help ourselves, we find moments of happiness. When we help others, we find lasting fulfillment.

 - The future is only scary if we try to avoid it.
 - A good leader takes care of those in their charge. A bad leader takes charge of those in their care.
 - Corporate culture matters. How management chooses to treat its people impacts everything – for better or for worse.
 - To be authentic is to be at peace with your imperfections.
 - Simple ideas are easier to understand. Ideas that are easier to understand are repeated. Ideas that are repeated change the world.
 - Good marketing speaks to human beings – the way human beings understand and take in information.
 - Some in management positions operate as if they are in a tree of monkeys. They make sure that everyone at the top of the tree looking down sees only smiles. But all too often, those at the bottom looking up see only asses.
 - Focus on long term success but be willing to make short term adjustments to get there.
 - Leadership is absolutely about inspiring action, but it is also about guarding against mis-action.
 - What we do for others has a direct impact on how we feel about ourselves.

 - There is no decision that we can make that doesn’t come with some sort of balance or sacrifice.
 - What good is it to have a belly if there’s no fire in it? Wake up, drink your passion, light a match and get to work.
 - Genius is in the idea. Impact, however, comes from action!
 - I don’t care about convincing the people who think I’m naive or an idiot. I’m interested in how do I inspire the people who are open-minded that there’s a different way of seeing the world.

 - Panic causes tunnel vision. Calm acceptance of danger allows us to more easily assess the situation and see the options.
 - Greatness is not born from one success. Greatness is born from persevering through the countless failed attempts that preceded.

 - Most people ignore opportunities because they see only danger. Entrepreneurs ignore danger because they see only opportunities.
 - Focus on where you’re going and you’ll know what steps to take. Focus on the steps you’re taking and you won’t know where you’re going.
 - Those who lead inspire us Whether they are individuals or organizations, we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to.
 - The passion to change the world for the better is a more powerful force than defense to keep it the same.
 - Leadership is like exercise. Do it everyday, the results take time but you will see them. It’s the little things.
 - The goal is not simply to ‘work hard, play hard.’ The goal is to make our work and our play indistinguishab le.
 - You have to have a patience for exercise. You have to have a patience for college. You have to have a patience for relationships. Once the momentum gets going it takes on a life all of its own.
 - Stories are attempts to share our values and beliefs. Storytelling is worthwhile when it tells what we stand for.
 - Unhealthy cultures create addiction. Healthy cultures create social bonds.
 - If you’re not remarkable, you’re invisible.
 - We don’t do business with companies. We do business with people.
 - Employees represent an opportunity to inspire not a burden to carry.
 - And when a leader embraces their responsibility to care for people instead of caring for numbers, then people will follow, solve problems and see to it that that leader’s vision comes to life the right way, a stable way and not the expedient way.
 - Poor leaders push us towards the goal. Great leaders guide us through the journey.
 - The strong bond of friendship is not always a balanced equation; friendship is not always about giving and taking in equal shares. Instead, friendship is grounded in a feeling that you know exactly who will be there for you when you need something, no matter what or when.
 - When we have a clear sense of our destination, we can be flexible in the route we take to reach it.
 - It’s better to go slowly in the right direction than go speeding off in the wrong direction.
 - We should never let reality interfere with our dreams. Reality can’t see what we can see.
 - Failure is not tied to money; it is a mindset. Failure is when we accept the lot we are given.
 - Emails get reactions. Phone calls start conversations.
 - Courage isn’t inside; it’s external. It comes from someone else telling you they believe in you.
 - Life changes for the better when we realize that we don’t have to know everything and we don’t have to pretend we do.
 - The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe. When we are selective about doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges.
 - In this age of omniconnectedness, words like ‘network,’ ‘community’ and even ‘friends’ no longer mean what they used to. Networks don’t exist on LinkedIn. A community is not something that happens on a blog or on Twitter. And a friend is more than someone whose online status you check.
 - Managers watch over our numbers, our time and our results. Leaders watch over us.
 - We can’t all be good at everything. This is partly the logic behind having a team in the first place, so each role can be filled with the person best suited for that role and together, every job and every strength is covered.
 - Selfish is easy. It’s sharing that takes courage.
 - What you do is proof of what you believe.
 - Good marketing offers us a view of the world. Bad marketing offers us a product to buy.
 - The value of networking is not measured by the number of people we meet but by the number of people we introduce to others.
 - Curiosity is essential for progress. Only when we look to worlds beyond our own can we really know if there’s room for improvement.
 - Directions are instructions given to explain how. Direction is a vision offered to explain why.
 - If you have the opportunity to do amazing things in your life, I strongly encourage you to invite someone to join you.
 - Actions speak louder than words. All companies say they care, right? But few actually exercise that care.

 - The trick to balance is to not make sacrificing important things become the norm.
 - Inspire people to do the things that inspire them and, together, we can change our world.
 - When we accept the fact that we can’t do everything, we are more willing to ask for and accept help when we do anything.
 - It’s better to do it than to talk about how perfect it could be.
 - Some see risk as a reason not to try. Some see it as an obstacle to overcome. The risk is the same; to try or not depends on your perspective.
 - Most politicians are not authentic.
 - When I present, I cheat. I only talk about things I care about.
 - Your work is your own private megaphone to tell the world what you believe.
 - When a leader makes the choice to put the safety and lives of the people inside the organization first, to sacrifice their comforts and sacrifice the tangible results, so that the people remain and feel safe and feel like they belong, remarkable things happen.
 - A great leader will never sacrifice the people for the numbers.
 - Words may inspire, but only ACTION creates change. Most of us live our lives by accident – we live life as it happens. Fulfillment comes when we live our lives on purpose.
 - We crave explanations for most everything, but innovation and progress happen when we allow ourselves to embrace uncertainty.
 - In the military, they give medals for people who are willing to sacrifice themselves so that others may survive. In business, we give bonuses to people who sacrifice others.
 - Complaining begets more complaints. Anger begets more anger. And optimism begets more optimism.
 - Systems and processes are essential to keep the crusade going, but they should not replace the crusade.
 - What good is an idea if it remains an idea? Try. Experiment. Iterate. Fail. Try again. Change the world.
 - Don’t wait for perfection before you start. Start somewhere so you can have something tangible you can work to perfect.
 - Success comes when we wake up every day in that never-ending pursuit of why we do what we do.
 - If we were good at everything we would have no need for each other.
 - The quality of a leader cannot be judged by the answers he gives, but by the questions he asks.
 - The leader’s job is to lead and protect. Not have all the answers, not know everything to do, not to micromanage and tell people what to do or how to do it. A leader’s job is to lead and protect. That’s their job, and it’s the people within the organization – their job is to get the work done.
 - Great leaders don’t need to act tough. Their confidence and humility serve to underscore their toughness.
 - Would anybody be offended if we gave a $150 million bonus to Gandhi? How about a $250 million bonus to Mother Teresa? Do we have an issue with that? None at all. Great leaders would never sacrifice the people to save the numbers. They would sooner sacrifice the numbers to save the people.
 - A true friend is someone with whom protocol is no longer necessary.
 - Leaders don’t convince people to follow them. Leaders walk forward alone and those who want to go down their path decide to follow.
 - Leaders don’t complain about what’s not working. Leaders celebrate what is working and work to amplify it.
 - The value of emotions comes from sharing them, not just having them.
 - Humility, I have learned, must never be confused with meekness. Humility is being open to the ideas of others.
 - We last longer if we compete against ourselves for the good of others instead of competing against others for the good of ourselves.
 - The single best machine to measure trust is a human being. We haven’t figured out a metric that works better than our own sort of, like, ‘There’s something fishy about you.’
 - Mergers are like marriages. They are the bringing together of two individuals. If you wouldn’t marry someone for the ‘operational efficiencies’ they offer in the running of a household, then why would you combine two companies with unique cultures and identities for that reason?
 - The confident ask questions to learn what will connect. The insecure just keep talking with the hope something will stick.
 - If you want to achieve anything in this world, you have to get used to the idea that not everyone will like you.
 - Focus on money and we will make money. Focus on impact and we will make an impact.
 - Any great and inspiring leader or organization that ever existed set out to do something completely unrealistic.
 - Good leadership is always human. It takes time and energy. It is hard work. Which is why good leadership is so special when we find it.
 - We live in times of high stress. Messages that are simple, messages that are inspiring, messages that are life-affirming, are a welcome break from our real lives.
 - Our struggles are the short term lessons we learn to achieve long term success.
 - When we can communicate from the inside out, we’re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior, and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do. This is where gut decisions come from.
 - If you want to be a great leader, remember to treat all people with respect at all times. For one, because you never know when you’ll need their help. And two, because it’s a sign you respect people, which all great leaders do.
 - Don’t freak yourself out by what other people have. They don’t have what you’ve got.
 - We become leaders when we accept the responsibility to protect those in our care.
 - Great communicators don’t just hear the words. Great communicators hear the meaning behind the words.
 - The world is a bell curve. Classroom test scores, employee performance in a company or how many people really, really like you. No matter the population you’re studying, they always fit neatly across the standard deviations of the famous bell curve.
 - Believing that your competition is stronger and better than you pushes you to better yourselves.
 - There is a difference between running with all your heart with your eyes closed and running with all your heart with your eyes wide open.

 - When we are in groups, when we are surrounded by people who believe what we believe, trust emerges and our very survival and progress goes up.
 - Those who fear the new are the ones who have mastered the old.
 - Authorities act with themselves in mind. Leaders act with others in mind. Authorities take. Leaders give. Authorities die. Leaders live on.
 - During World War II, the pilot losses were staggering. In some bombing raids, as many as 80% of the planes that left did not return.
 - When we are selective about doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges.
 - Nike doesn’t want to make products for everyone – they want to make products for champions.
 - Communication is not about speaking what we think. Communication is about ensuring others hear what we mean.
 - Make it about them, not about you.
 - There are two kinds of experts: academic experts and practical experts. One is not better than the other, but they are very different, and each offers very different value.
 - Offer your strengths to others and you’ll be amazed how many people offer their strengths to you.
 - Changing the world takes more than everything any one person knows, but not more than we know together.
 - There are leaders, and there are those who lead.
 - Good listeners have a huge advantage. For one, when they engage in conversation, they make people ‘feel’ heard. They ‘feel’ that someone really understands their wants, needs and desires. And for good reason; a good listener does care to understand.
 - Ideas are like dreams; they will disappear unless we record them. Write a book, a blog, build a company, anything that makes the ideas real.
 - How can you help the human race progress?
 - It is like when a player has a slump, we do not trade them, we coach them. It is the same with our employees. The best leaders come to the aid of their people, whose performance is down. Not come down harder on them.
 - Though we may have desires or bold goals, for whatever reason, most of us don’t think we can achieve something beyond what we’re qualified to achieve. Why, I ask, do we let reality interfere with our dreams?
 - TiVo and other digital recording devices have confounded advertisers. The ad industry sees the technology as a threat to their product.
 - We can not lead an organization, we can run an organization. We can only lead people.
 - All the great organizations in the world, all have a sense of why that organization does what it does.
 - Republicans are completely befuddled by Obama’s ‘star power’ and don’t seem to have a clear or effective strategy to compete.
 - Leaders, whatever the size of their organizations, are those willing to put the interests of other people before their own.
 - A friend is an emotional bond, just like friendship is a human experience.
 - It is better to disappoint people with the truth than to appease them with a lie.
 - Returning from work feeling inspired, safe, fulfilled and grateful is a natural human right to which we are all entitled and not a modern luxury that only a few lucky ones are able to find.
 - True love exists in business. It’s when Employee and Employer are amazingly grateful to have each other. We should all have true love at work.
 - Great leaders see money as fuel, not a destination.
 - We can make up for lost money, but we can’t make up for lost time.
 - One of the best paradoxes of leadership is a leader’s need to be both stubborn and open-minded. A leader must insist on sticking to the vision and stay on course to the destination. But he must be open-minded during the process.
 - More information is always better than less. When people know the reason things are happening, even if it’s bad news, they can adjust their expectations and react accordingly. Keeping people in the dark only serves to stir negative emotions.
 - The most basic human desire is to feel like you belong. Fitting in is important.
 - A good leader shares information, even if they don’t know the whole story. Without any information, people create their own, which causes fear and paranoia.
 - Work hard to seem infallible and others will work to find our flaws. Admit our shortcomings and others will work to help us be infallible.
 - Pursue the thing inside us and others will help us. Pursue the things outside us and others will compete with us.
 - Follow those who follow something bigger than themselves – an idea, a belief, a vision, a cause. Run away from those who say we need to follow them.
 - Any parent who tells their kids that they can’t attend a school play or go to a soccer match because they have to work is kidding themselves. It’s OK to miss a game or two or a performance here and there, but it’s not all right to miss the majority of them.
 - Hire people inspired to achieve something big over people who demand something big before they feel inspired.
 - We have no choice, we must all die. How we live, however, is entirely of our choosing.
 - Notoriously outspoken, his sentences always punctuated with profanities, General George S. Patton was the epitome of what a leader should be like – or so he thought. Patton believed a leader should look and act tough, so he cultivated his image and his personality to match his philosophy.
 - It’s important to slow down, every now and then, for no other reason than to call someone to say ‘Hi.’ It doesn’t have to be a long conversation. Just calling out of the blue does more to let someone know you still care about them than nearly anything else.
 - The big picture doesn’t just come from distance; it also comes from time.
 - When I was a kid, I was a bit of a space geek. I loved the space program and all things NASA. I would read books about our solar system; I had pictures of the Space Shuttle on my bedroom wall. And yes, I even went to Space Camp.
 - Risk deters those who see what they could lose. Those focused on the gain see it as a necessary part of their journey, even if the possibility of loss exists.
 - Anyone can sell product by dropping their prices, but it does not breed loyalty.
 - My sister made certain choices about the life she wanted. Those choices include a steady job, a husband and children. But balance and stability come at a cost. It is harder for her to be spontaneous. It is harder to just up and leave.
 - Reality will always prevail so why help it? Be an idealist and see what happens.
 - Good leadership is hard to measure on a daily basis which is why so many default to doing what’s easy to measure instead.
 - We think leadership is about rank and power, but better to think of leadership as the responsibility for other human beings. That leadership and rank may not go together. So it manifests in this remarkable way.
 - Outside advice can only tell you how a decision looks. Only you can know how it feels. The best decisions look and feel right.
 - Leadership isn’t answering the questions others ask. Leadership is asking others to answer their own questions.
 - Money is a short-term result that incentivizes short-term decision making.
 - I have been inspired by Martin Luther King and how he inspired a movement. I have learned that a cause must be organic; if it is to have an impact it must belong to those who join the movement and not those who lead it.
 - The irony is that the best thing we can do is, well one option, is to quit job we don’t like. You don’t always have to quit, and quite frankly, option two is to try to help others solve the problem that you are struggling with.
 - Great leaders state out loud what they intend to do and in doing so, they get things done.
 - Time and energy. Those are the most valuable sacrifices leaders can make.
 - Entrepreneurs must be practical experts. They needn’t set out to be subject matter experts in what they do; they must set out to solve a problem or pursue some cause or purpose greater than themselves.
 - The bad leaders are the ones that push hard so they can gain, who brow beat us so that they can receive the benefit of our hard work, not so we can enjoy the success.
 - The value we provide most to others is the same value we appreciate most from others.
 - Leaders may inspire, but only when the people decide to act does the leader’s vision become a movement.
 - It’s ok if others share our ideas as long as they build upon them. It’s called progress.
 - My concern is that we live in an economy in which stabbing someone and waiting for them to complain before we remove the knife has become the normal way of doing business. When did we lose sight of the fact that it’s not nice to stab people in the first place?
 - To operate based on conviction and belief requires an acceptance that your actions could get you fired. This is different from pig-headed bravado, and it is different from putting the company at risk.
 - If we care about the average working American, then Wal-Mart matters. A lot.
 - Optimists focus on the place they are going. Pessimists focus on the obstacles along the route. To become an optimist simply look ahead.
 - The responsibility of leadership is not taken, it is given. Only when others choose to follow us can we truly lead.
 - Optimism is the ability to focus on where we’re going, not where we’re coming from.
 - The difference between those who do and those who don’t is that those who don’t believe it when they are told they can’t.
 - You’ll never see the president carry his own luggage, and why? Because even though we know he has luggage, it would reduce his stature if he was too much like us. We need to think of our leaders as being above us, even though they must still relate to us.
 - If you can clearly articulate the dream or the goal, start.
 - I don’t consider myself an expert in the why. I don’t consider myself an expert in leadership. I consider myself a student of leadership and I consider myself a student of the why. I’m constantly learning and I’m constantly looking for opportunities where it it will fail.
 - If you care, do something. If you don’t care, please stay out of the way of those who do.
 - Anyone who achieves any kind of success, however you want to define it, sometimes can’t let go of it.
 - To become an academic expert takes years of studying. Academic experts are experts in how and what others have done. They use case studies and observation to understand a subject.
 - The irony is, the advertising industry knows everyone hates what they produce. This is why they keep looking for new ways to force people to stay tuned.
 - Every one of us has the capacity to lead.
 - Let us not attack those who disagree. Let us defend those who follow.
 - I try to find, celebrate and teach leaders how to build platforms that will inspire others.
 - New ideas need audiences like flowers need bees. No matter how bright and colorful, they will die unless others work to spread them.
 - I think most people are inherently interested in how their brain works, in what makes them tick.
