 - I am deathless, I am the eternal Lord For I have spread the seed of the Word.
 - I turn to right and left, in all the earth I see no signs of justice, sense or worth: A man does evil deeds, and all his days Are filled with luck and universal praise; Another’s good in all he does – he dies A wretched, broken man whom all despise.
 - But all this world is like a tale we hear – Men’s evil, and their glory, disappear.
 - From moment then to moment their desire Gained strength, and wisdom fled before love’s fire; Passion engulfed them, and these lovers lay Entwined together till the break of day.
