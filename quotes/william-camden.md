 - The early bird catches the worm.
 - All the proof of a pudding is in the eating.
 - Betwixt the stirrup and the ground Mercy I asked, mercy I found.
 - An inch in a miss is as good as an ell.
 - It is hard to teach an old dog tricks.
 - God sendeth cold after clothes.
 - He that mischief hatcheth, mischief catcheth.
 - Wisdom is at all times the least burdensome traveling pack.
 - Better halfe a loafe than no bread.
