 - Itâ€™s hard to tell that the world we live in is either a reality or a dream.
 - I always ask myself one question: what is human? What does it mean to be human? Maybe people will consider my new films brutal again. But this violence is just a reflection of what they really are, of what is in each one of us to certain degree.
 - I try not to interpret things of the world into a single meaning. Rather, I try the opposite.
 - I intended to portray the joy, anger, sorrow and pleasure of our lives through four seasons and through the life of a monk who lives in a temple on Jusan Pond surrounded only by nature.
