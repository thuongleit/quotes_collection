 - Language is not a genetic gift, it is a social gift. Learning a new language is becoming a member of the club -the community of speakers of that language.
 - You can’t see other people’s point of view when you have only one language.
 - The best teachers are the best storytellers.
 - Learning is never aversive – usually we are not aware of it at all. It is failure to learn that is frustrating and boring, and so is having to attend to nonsensical activities.

 - Reading and writing don’t inevitably go together. You can read without learning a thing about writing, grammar, or spelling, although, you certainly can’t learn anything about writing, grammar, or spelling unless you read.
 - It is infinitely more useful for a child to hear a story told by a person than by computer. Because the greatest part of the learning experience lies not in the particular words of the story but in the involvement with the individual reading it.
