 - We are human only in contact, and conviviality, with what is not human.
 - There are so many unsung heroines and heroes at this broken moment in our collective story, so many courageous persons who, unbeknownst to themselves, are holding together the world by their resolute love or contagious joy. Although I do not know your names, I can feel you out there.
 - Breathing involves a continual oscillation between exhaling and inhaling, offering ourselves to the world at one moment and drawing the world into ourselves at the next...
 - Such reciprocity is the very structure of perception. We experience the sensuous world only by rendering ourselves vulnerable to that world. Sensory perception is this ongoing interweavement: the terrain enters into us only to the extent that we allow ourselves to be taken up within that terrain.
 - As nonhuman animals, plants, and even ‘inanimate’ rivers once spoke to our oral ancestors, so the ostensibly “inert” letters on the page now speak to us! This is a form of animism that we take for granted, but it is animism nonetheless – as mysterious as a talking stone.
 - We like to assume that language is a purely human property, our exclusive possession, and that everything else is basically mute.
 - We sleep, allowing gravity to hold us, allowing Earth – our larger body – to recalibrate our neurons, composting the keen encounters of our waking hours, stirring them back, as dreams, into the sleeping substance of our muscles.
 - The world we experience with our unaided senses is fluid and animate, shifting and transforming in response to our own shifts of position and of mood.
 - It was a though we’d been living for a year in a dense grove of old trees, a cluster of firs, each with its own rhythm and character, from whom our bodies had drawn not just shelter but perhaps even a kind of guidance as we grew into a family.
 - Sensory perception is the silken web that binds our separate nervous systems into the encompassing ecosystem.
 - Only as the written text began to speak would the voices of the forest, and of the river, begin to fade. And only then would language loosen its ancient association with the invisible breath, the spirit sever itself from the wind, the psyche dissociate itself from the environing air.
 - Other animals, in a constant and mostly unmediated relation with their sensory surroundings, think with the whole of their bodies.
 - Humans are tuned for relationship. The eyes, the skin, the tongue, ears, and nostrils-all are gates where our body receives the nourishment of otherness.
 - To describe the animate life of particular things is simply the most precise and parsimonious way to articulate the things as we spontaneously experience them, prior to all our conceptualizations and definitions.
 - Does the human intellect, or “reason,” really spring us free from our inherence in the depths of this wild proliferation of forms? Or on the contrary, is the human intellect rooted in, and secretly borne by, our forgotten contact with the multiple nonhuman shapes that surround us on every hand?
 - Only by affirming the animateness of perceived things do we allow our words to emerge directly from the depths of our ongoing reciprocity with the world.
 - What we say has such a profound influence upon what we see, and hear, and taste of the world!
