 - Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things.
 - Whenever you see a successful business, someone once made a courageous decision.
 - You can’t manage what you don’t measure.
 - If you want something new, you have to stop doing something old.
 - It’s more important to do the right thing than to do things right.
 - The entrepreneur always searches for change, responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity.
 - Quality in a service or product is not what you put into it. It is what the client or customer gets out of it.
 - Business has only two basic functions – marketing and innovation.
 - Do what you do best, and outsource the rest.
 - The greatest danger in times of turbulence is not the turbulence; it is to act with yesterday’s logic.
 - Strategy is a commodity, execution is an art.
 - Results are obtained by exploiting opportunities, not by solving problems.
 - The most important thing in communication is to hear what isn’t being said.
 - Only three things happen naturally in organizations: friction, confusion, and underperformance. Everything else requires leadership.
 - Follow effective action with quiet reflection. From the quiet reflection will come even more effective action.
 - Efficiency is doing better what is already being done.
 - If you want to predict the future create it.
 - There are only two things in a business that make money – innovation and marketing, everything else is cost.
 - The race for Quality has no finish line – so technically, it’s more like a death march. Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.
 - If you can’t measure it, you can’t change it.
 - The task of leadership is to create an alignment of strengths so strong that it makes the system’s weaknesses irrelevant.
 - A man should never be appointed into a managerial position if his vision focuses on people’s weaknesses rather than on their strengths.
 - People learn the most when teaching others.
 - Efficiency, which is doing things right, is irrelevant until you work on the right things.
 - What’s measured improves.
 - The ultimate resource in economic development is people. It is people, not capital or raw materials that develop an economy.
 - Management by objective works – if you know the objectives. Ninety percent of the time you don’t.
 - Marketing is not a function, it is the whole business seen from the customer’s point of view.
 - Until we can manage time, we can manage nothing else.
 - Plans are only good intentions unless they immediately degenerate into hard work.
 - The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well the product or service fits him and sells itself.
 - Long range planning does not deal with future decisions, but with the future of present decisions.
 - Because its purpose is to create a customer, the business has two and only two functions: Marketing and Innovation. Marketing and Innovation produce results. All the rest are costs.
 - Plans are worthless, but planning is invaluable.
 - Mission defines strategy, and strategy defines structure.
 - You cannot build performance on weaknesses. You can build only on strengths.
 - If you want it, measure it. If you can’t measure it, forget it.
 - Unless commitment is made, there are only promises and hopes; but no plans.
 - The real achiever do one thing at a time.
 - Marketing is the distinguishing, unique function of the business.
 - The critical question is not “How can I achieve?” but “What can I contribute?”
 - If there is any one secret of effectiveness, it is concentration. Effective executives do first things first and they do one thing at a time.
 - There is nothing worse than doing the wrong thing well.
 - Leadership is lifting a person’s vision to high sights, the raising of a person’s performance to a higher standard, the building of a personality beyond its normal limitations.
 - Leadership is an achievement of trust.
 - The purpose of a business is to create a customer.
 - Rank does not confer privilege or give power. It imposes responsibility.
 - The single most important thing to remember about any enterprise is that there are no results inside its walls. The result of a business is a satisfied customer.
 - The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous.
 - Making changes to better appeal to customer is INNOVATION.
 - Time is the scarcest resource and unless it is managed nothing else can be managed.
 - The customer rarely buys what the company thinks it’s selling.
 - What is the major problem? It is fundamentally the confusion between effectiveness and efficiency that stands between doing the right things and doing things right. There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.
 - The most serious mistakes are not being made as a result of wrong answers. The true dangerous thing is asking the wrong question.
 - The essence of management is to make knowledge productive.
 - Effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by results not attributes.
 - The most common source of mistakes in management decisions is the emphasis on finding the right answer rather than the right question.
 - One cannot manage change. One can only be ahead of it.
 - Great wisdom not applied to action and behavior is meaningless data.
 - Innovation is the specific tool of entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an opportunity for a different business or a different service.
 - The organization is, above all, social. It is people.
 - If you have more than five goals, you have none.
 - Don’t solve problems. Pursue opportunities.
 - Marketing and innovation make money. Everything else is a cost.
 - The purpose of information is not knowledge. It is being able to take the right action.
 - The relevant question is not simply what shall we do tomorrow, but rather what shall we do today in order to get ready for tomorrow.
 - Knowledge applied is productivity.
 - One can either work or meet. One cannot do both at the same time.
 - Our job in life is to make a positive difference, not prove we’re right.
 - What the customer buys and considers value is never a product. It is always utility, that is, what a product or a service does for the customer.
 - People who don’t take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year. People who do take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year.
 - There are two types of people in the business community: those who produce results and those who give you reasons why they didn’t.
 - Entrepreneurs believe that profit is what matters most in a new enterprise. But profit is secondary. Cash flow matters most.
 - Profit for a company is like oxygen for a person. If you don’t have enough of it, you’re out of the game. But if you think your life is about breathing, you’re really missing something.
 - The most effective way to manage change is to create it.
 - The great challenge to management today is to make productive the tremendous new resource, the knowledge worker. This, rather than the productivity of the manual worker, is the key to economic growth and economic performance in today’s society.
 - Adequacy is the enemy of excellence.
 - It takes far less energy to move from first-rate performance to excellence than it does to move from incompetence to mediocrity.
 - You can either take action, or you can hang back and hope for a miracle. Miracles are great, but they are so unpredictable.
 - No executive has ever suffered because his subordinates were strong and effective.
 - Knowledge has become the key economic resource and the dominant-and perhaps even the only-source of competitive advantage.
 - For new technology to replace old, it has to have at least ten times the benefit.
 - Organizations are no longer built on force, but on trust.
 - One does not “manage” people. The task is to lead people.
 - Managing innovation will increasingly become a challenge to management, and especially to top management, and a touchstone of its competence.
 - The fewer data needed, the better the information. And an overload of information, that is, anything much beyond what is truly needed, leads to information blackout. It does not enrich, but impoverishes.
 - We live in an age of unprecedented opportunity: If you’ve got ambition and smarts, you can rise to the top of your chosen profession, regardless of where you started out.
 - More business decisions occur over lunch and dinner than at any other time, yet no MBA courses are given on the subject.
 - Business enterprise is an organ of society. There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.
 - The productivity of people requires continuous learning, as the Japanese have taught us. It requires adoption in the West of the specific Japanese Zen concept where one learns to do better what one already does well.
 - There is a point at which a transformation has to take place.
 - In the knowledge economy everyone is a volunteer, but we have trained our managers to manage conscripts.
 - Leaders grow; they are not made.
 - Nobody in the world is as good at making decisions as the Japanese.
 - Information is the manager’s main tool, indeed the manager’s capital, and it is he who must decide what information he needs and how to use it.
 - The productivity of work is not the responsibility of the worker but of the manager.
 - To make knowledge productive, we will have to learn to see both forest and tree. We will have to learn to connect.
 - The tool user, provided the tool is made well, need not, and indeed should not, know anything about the tool.
 - The enterprise that does not innovate ages and declines. And in a period of rapid change such as the present, the decline will be fast.
 - Conductors do not know how the oboe does its work, but they know what the oboe should contribute.
 - Meetings are a symptom of bad organization. The fewer meetings the better.
 - The only definition of a leader is someone who has followers.
 - Effective people are not problem minded; they’re opportunity-minded. They feed opportunities and starve problems. They think preventively.
 - Change is the norm; unless an organization sees that its task is to lead change, that organization will not survive.
 - The days of the ‘intuitive’ manager are numbered.
 - There’s nothing so useless than executing a task efficiently when it actually never should have been executed at all.
 - Doing the right thing is more important than doing the thing right.
 - Knowledge has to be improved, challenged, and increased constantly, or it vanishes.
 - The need to manage oneself is creating a revolution in human affairs.
 - All economic activity is by definition “high risk.” And defending yesterday – that is, not innovating – is far more risky than making tomorrow.
 - Charisma becomes the undoing of leaders. It makes them inflexible, convinced of their own infallibility, unable to change.
 - Every single social and global issue of our day is a business opportunity in disguise.
 - The better a man is, the more mistakes he will make, for the more new things he will try.
 - Do first things first, and second things not at all.
 - Your first and foremost job as a leader is to take charge of your own energy and then help to orchestrate the energy of those around you.
 - Entrepreneurship is neither a science nor an art. It is a practice.
 - To survive and succeed, every organization will have to turn itself into a change agent.
 - Inside an organization there are only cost centers. The only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced.
 - Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy. Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship.
 - Profitability is the sovereign criterion of the enterprise.
 - The only thing we know about the future is that it will be different.
 - Every enterprise is learning and teaching institution. Training and development must be built into it on all levels, training and development that never stop.
 - Business, that’s easily defined – it’s other people’s money.
 - There’s an enormous number of managers who have retired on the job.
 - The most valuable assets of a 20th-century company were its production equipment. The most valuable assets of a 21st-century institution, whether business or nonbusiness, will be its knowledge, workers, and their productivity.
 - Use feedback analysis to identify your strengths. Then go to work on improving your strengths. Identify and eliminate bad habits that hinder the full development of your strengths. Figure out what you should do and do it. Finally, decide what you should not do.
 - What we need is an entrepreneurial society in which innovation and entrepreneurship are normal, steady and continuous.
 - Profit is not a cause but a result-.
 - Company cultures are like country cultures. Never try to change one. Try, instead, to work with what you’ve got.
 - The concept of profit maximization is, in fact, meaningless.
 - Luck never built a business. Prosperity and growth come only to the business that systematically finds and exploits its potential.
 - Success in the knowledge economy comes to those who know themselves – their strengths, their values, and how they best perform.
 - Since we live in an age of innovation, a practical education must prepare a man for work that does not yet exist and cannot yet be clearly defined.
 - Spontaneity is an infinite number of rehearsed possibilities.
 - An effective executive builds on strengths – their own strengths, the strengths of superiors, colleagues, subordinates, and on the strength of the situation.
 - Every few hundred years in Western history there occurs a sharp transformation. Within a few short decades, society – its worldview, its basic values, its social and political structures, its art, its key institutions – rearranges itself. We are currently living through such a time.
 - Most of what we call management consists of making it difficult for people to get their work done.
 - Cultivate a deep understanding of yourself – not only what your strengths and weaknesses are but also how you learn, how you work with others, what your values are, and where you can make the greatest contribution. Because only when you operate from strengths can you achieve true excellence.
 - Meetings are by definition a concession to a deficient organization. For one either meets or one works. One cannot do both at the same time.
 - Trust is congruence between what you say and what you do.
 - Every organization must be prepared to abandon everything it does to survive in the future.
 - The manager who comes up with the right solution to the wrong problem is more dangerous than the manager who comes up with the wrong solution to the right problem.
 - Everybody has accepted by now that change is unavoidable. But that still implies that change is like death and taxes – it should be postponed as long as possible and no change would be vastly preferable. But in a period of upheaval, such as the one we are living in, change is the norm.
 - Universities won’t survive. The future is outside the traditional campus, outside the traditional classroom. Distance learning is coming on fast.
 - Working with people is difficult, but not impossible.
 - The only things that evolve by themselves in an organization are disorder, friction and malperformance.
 - Vision without execution is delusion. The joy is in the results.
 - We spend a lot of time teaching leaders what to do. We don’t spend enough time teaching leaders what to stop. Half the leaders I have met don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.
 - In most organizations, the bottleneck is at the top of the bottle.
 - Most leaders don’t need to learn what to do. They need to learn what to stop.
 - Entrepreneurship is “risky” mainly because so few of the so-called entrepreneurs know what they are doing.
 - Strategic management is not a box of tricks or a bundle of techniques. It is analytical thinking and commitment of resources to action. But quantification alone is not planning. Some of the most important issues in strategic management cannot be quantified at all.
 - Knowledge is power. In post-capitalism, power comes from transmitting information to make it productive, not hiding it.
 - The question that faces the strategic decision maker is not what his organisation should do tomorrow. It is, what do we have to do today to be ready for an uncertain tomorrow?
 - No institution can possibly survive if it needs geniuses or supermen to manage it. It must be organized in such a way as to be able to get along under a leadership composed of average human beings.
 - Leadership is defined by results not attributes.
 - Replace your pursuit of success with the pursuit of contribution.
 - Nothing is less productive than to make more efficient what should not be done at all.
 - People in any organization are always attached to the obsolete – the things that should have worked but did not, the things that once were productive and no longer are.
 - By themselves, character and integrity do not accomplish anything. But their absence faults everything else.
 - Nobody can predict the future; the idea is to have a firm grasp of the present.
 - There is the risk you cannot afford to take, and there is the risk you cannot afford not to take.
 - Balance Sheets are meaningless. Our accounting systems are still based on the assumption that 80% of costs are manual labor.
 - Strong people have strong weaknesses.
 - The first organization structure in the modern West was laid down in the canon law of the Catholic Church eight hundred years ago.
 - The task of management is to make people capable of joint performance, to make their strengths effective and their weaknesses irrelevant.
 - The purpose of an organization is to enable ordinary humans beings to do extraordinary things.
 - Results is all that separates one company from another.
 - As a manager you’re paid to be uncomfortable. If you’re comfortable, it’s a sure sign you’re doing things wrong.
 - Unless strategy evaluation is performed seriously and systematically, and unless strategists are willing to act on the results, energy will be used up defending yesterday.
 - When it rains manna from heaven, some people put up an umbrella. Others reach for a big spoon.
 - The talk you hear about adapting to change is not only stupid, it’s dangerous. The only way you can manage change is to create it.
 - The leader of the past was a person who knew how to tell. The leader of the future will be a person who knows how to ask.
 - Communism is evil. Its driving forces are the deadly sins of envy and hatred.
 - My greatest strength as a consultant is to be ignorant and ask a few questions.
 - Promotion should not be more important than accomplishment, or avoiding instability more important than taking the right risk.
 - You cannot prevent a major catastrophe, but you can build an organization that is battle-ready, where people trust one another. In military training, the first rule is to instill soldiers with trust in their officers – because without trust, they won’t fight.
 - Every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure.
 - Leadership is all hype. We’ve had three great leaders in this century-Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
 - Whenever anything is being accomplished, it is being done, I have learned, by a monomaniac with a mission.
 - Business is society’s change agent.
 - Accept the fact that we have to treat almost anybody as a volunteer.
 - There is no perfect strategic decision. One always has to pay a price. One always has to balance conflicting objectives, conflicting opinions, and conflicting priorities. The best strategic decision is only an approximation – and a risk.
 - Business purpose and business mission are so rarely given adequate thought is perhaps the most important cause of business frustration and failure.
 - The leader sees leadership as responsibility rather than as rank and privilege.
 - Above all, innovation is not invention. It is a term of economics rather than of technology.
 - A business is not defined by its name, statutes, or articles of incorporation. It is defined by the business mission. Only a clear definition of the mission and purpose of the organization makes possible clear and realistic business objectives.
 - In todays economy, the most important resource is no longer labor, capital or land; it is knowledge.
 - Objectives are not commands; they are commitments.
 - Morale in an organization does not mean that “people get along together”; the test is performance not conformance.
 - There are just two questions to ask to attain success in business: First, “What business am I in?” Second, “How’s business?”
 - There is a point of complexity beyond which a business is no longer manageable.
 - Every three or four years I pick a new subject. It may be Japanese art; it may be economics. Three years of study are by no means enough to master a subject but they are enough to understand it. SO for more than 60 years I have kept studying one subject at a time.
 - What can I contribute that will significantly affect the performance and the results of the institution I serve?
 - Work is an extension of personality. It is achievement. It is one of the ways in which a person defines himself, measures his worth, and his humanity.
 - To improve communications, work not on the utter, but the recipient.
 - To make the future demands courage. It demands work. But it also demands faith.
 - Objectives are not fate; they are direction. They are not commands; they are commitments. They do not determine the future; they are a means to mobilize resources and energies of the business for the making of the future.
 - Innovation is the specific instrument of entrepreneurship. The act that endows resources with a new capacity to create wealth.
 - A manager sets objectives – A manager organizes – A manager motivates and communicates – A manager, by establishing yardsticks, measures – A manager develops people .
 - Any time I have seen someone accomplishing something magnificent, they have been a monomaniac with a mission. A single-minded individual with a passion.
 - Successful people know they need to get many things done-and done effectively. Therefore, they concentrate their time and energy on doing one thing at a time-and on doing first things firs.
 - One cannot hire a hand; the whole man always comes with it.
 - To make a living is no longer enough. Work also has to make a life.
 - All good strategy eventually degenerates into work.
 - An executive should be a realist; and no one is less realistic than the cynic.
 - It’s amazing how many things busy people are doing that never will be missed.
 - The strength of the computer lies in its being a logic machine. It does precisely what it is programed to do. This makes it fast and precise. It also makes it a total moron; for logic is essentially stupid.
 - Technology is not about tools, it deals with how Man works.
 - Management has authority only as long as it performs.
 - It is more productive to convert an opportunity into results than to solve a problem – which only restores the equilibrium of yesterday.
 - People are effective because they say ‘no,’ because they say, ‘this isn’t for me.’
 - Management means, in the last analysis, the substitution of thought for brawn and muscle, of knowledge for folkways and superstition, and of cooperation for force. It means the substitution of responsibility for obedience to rank, and of authority of performance for the authority of rank.
 - Erroneous assumptions can be disastrous.
 - Progress is obtained only by exploiting opportunities, not by solving problems. When you solve problems, all you do is guarantee a return to normalcy.
 - Ideas are cheap and abundant; what is of value is the effective placement of those ideas into situations that develop into action.
 - Succession planning often results in the selection of a weaker representation of yourself.
 - A person can perform only from strength. One cannot build performance on weakness, let alone on something one cannot do at all.
 - The monomaniac is unlikely to succeed. Most leave only their bleached bones in the roadless desert. But the rest of us, with our multiple interests instead of a single mission, are certain to fail and have no impact at all.
 - Time is totally perishable and cannot be stored. Yesterday’s time is gone forever, and will never come back. Time is always in short supply. There is no substitute for time. Everything requires time.
 - If you have too many problems, maybe you should get out of business. There is no law that says a company must last forever.
 - Decision making is the specific executive task.
 - Knowledge is the source of Wealth. Applied to tasks we already know, it becomes Productivity. Applied to tasks that are new, it becomes Innovation...
 - The really important things are said over cocktails and are never done.
 - We know nothing about motivation. All we can do is write books about it.
 - Defending yesterday is far more risky than making tomorrow.
 - No financial man will ever understand business because financial people think a company makes money. A company makes shoes, and no financial man understands that. They think money is real. Shoes are real.
 - Innovation opportunities do not come with the tempest but with the rustling of the breeze.
 - Teamwork is neither “good” nor “desirable.” It is a fact. Wherever people work together or play together they do so as a team. Which team to use for what purpose is a crucial, difficult and risky decision that is even harder to unmake. Managements have yet to learn how to make it.
 - The individual needs the return to spiritual values, for he can survive in the present human situation only by reaffirming that man is not just a biological and psychological being but also a spiritual being, that is creature, and existing for the purposes of his Creator and subject to Him.
 - We now accept the fact that learning is a lifelong process of keeping abreast of change. And the most pressing task is to teach people how to learn.
 - Objectives can be compared to a compass bearing by which a ship navigates. A compass bearing is firm, but in actual navigation, a ship may veer off its course for many miles. Without a compass bearing, a ship would neither find its port nor be able to estimate the time required to get there.
 - What managers decide to stop doing is often more important than what they decide to do.
 - Far too much reorganization goes on all the time. Organizitis is like a spastic colon.
 - If the feudal knight was the clearest embodiment of society in the early Middle Ages, and the “bourgeois” under Capitalism, the educated person will represent society in the post-capitalist society in which knowledge has become the central resource.
 - As soon as you move one step up from the bottom, your effectiveness depends on your ability to reach others through the spoken and written word.
 - An employer has no business with a man’s personality. The task is not to change personality, but to enable a person to achieve and to perform.
 - They wrongly believe that good intentions move mountains. Bulldozers move mountains. But there are exceptions.
 - A business exists because the consumer is willing to pay you his money. You run a business to satisfy the consumer. That isn’t marketing. That goes way beyond marketing.
 - We’ve spent the last 30 years focusing on the T in IT, and we’ll spend the next 30 years focusing on the I.
 - Elephants have a hard time adapting. Cockroaches outlive everything.
 - Successful leaders don’t start out asking, ‘What do I want to do?’ They ask, ‘What needs to be done?’ Then they ask, ‘Of those things that would make a difference, which are right for me?’
 - Never underrate the boss! The boss may look illiterate. He may look stupid. But there is no risk at all in overrating a boss. If you underrate him he will bitterly resent it or impute to you the deficiency in brains and knowledge you imputed to him.
 - The experience of the human race indicates strongly that the only person in abundant supply is the universal incompetent.
 - The dilemma of modern society: the conflict between the need for capital formation at a high rate and the popular condemnation of interest and dividends as “unearned income” and “capitalist,” if not as sinful and wicked.
 - The single minded ones, the monomaniacs, are the only true achievers.
 - Ideas are like frog eggs: you’ve got to lay a thousand to hatch one.
 - The young knowledge worker whose job is too small to challenge and test his abilities either leaves or declines rapidly into premature middle age, soured, cynical, unproductive.
 - Do not measure your life by your goals but what you are doing to achieve them.
 - All great change in business has come from outside the firm, not from inside.
 - The paradox of the prophet: his very success is his failure. The prophet whose time has come no longer shocks; he entertains.
 - Most Americans do not know what their strengths are. When you ask them, they look at you with a blank stare, or they respond in terms of subject knowledge, which is the wrong answer.
 - No one learns as much about a subject as one who is forced to teach it.
 - During periods of discontinuous, abrupt change, the essence of adaptation involves a keen sensitivity to what should be abandoned – not what should be changed or introduced. A willingness to depart from the familiar has distinct survival value.
 - The problem in my life and other people’s lives is not the absence of knowing what to do but the absence of doing it.
 - The most probable assumption is that no currently working ‘business theory’ will be valid 10 years hence.
 - To satisfy the customer is the mission and purpose of every business.
 - The job of a professional manager is not to like people. It is not to change people. It is to put their strengths to work.
 - For the social ecologist language is not “communication.” It is not just “message.” It is substance. It is the cement that holds humanity together. It creates community and communication. Social ecologists need not be “great” writers; but they have to be respectful writers, caring writers.
 - We can’t make people better by trying to eliminate their weaknesses, but we can help then perform better by building on their strengths.
 - Mother Teresa’s numerical results were not her greatest contribution. Instead, she made the world-and especially India-conscious of compassion.
 - Teaching 23-year-olds in an MBA programme strikes me as largely a waste of time. They lack the background of experience. You can teach them skills – accounting and what have you – but you can’t teach them management.
 - The fruit of your work grows on other people’s trees.
 - One does not start with facts. One starts with opinions.
 - To be effective, every knowledge worker, and especially every executive, therefore needs to dispose of time in fairly large chunks. To have small dribs and drabs of time at his disposal will not be sufficient even if the total is an impressive number of hours.
 - Without institution there is no management. But without management there is no institution.
 - Culture eats Christianity for breakfast.
 - The final test of greatness in a CEO is how well he chooses a successor and whether he can step aside and let the successor run the company.
 - What you have to do and the way you have to do it is incredibly simple. Whether you are willing to do it is another matter.
 - The manager is a servant. His master is the institution he manages and his first responsibility must therefore be to it.
 - Large organizations cannot be versatile. A large organization is effective through its mass rather than through its agility. Fleas can jump many times their own height, but not an elephant.
 - If general perception changes from seeing the glass as ‘half-full’ to seeing it as ‘half empty’ there are major innovative opportunities.
 - Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual. They fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement. They never have learned that insights become effectiveness only through hard systematic work.
 - Managers are the basic and scarcest resource of any business enterprise.
 - The Pertinent Question is NOT how to do things right – but how to find the right things to do, and to concentrate resources and efforts on them.
 - In the Western tradition, we have focused on teaching as a skill and forgotten what Socrates knew: teaching is a gift, learning is a skill.
 - Once the facts are clear the decisions jump out at you.
 - Don’t take on things you don’t believe in and that you yourself are not good at. Learn to say no. Effective leaders match the objective needs of their company with the subjective competencies. As a result, they get an enormous amount of things done fast.
 - Don’t try to innovate for the future. Innovate for the present!
 - Production is not the application of tools to materials, but logic to work.
 - Quality of character doesn’t make a leader, but the lack of it flaws the entire process.
 - Education gives you neither experience nor wisdom.
 - Suppliers and especially manufacturers have market power because they have information about a product or a service that the customer does not and cannot have, and does not need if he can trust the brand. This explains the profitability of brands.
 - Here I am, fifty-eight, and I still don’t know what I’m going to be when I grow up.
 - Success always obsoletes the very behavior that achieved it.
 - An established company which, in an age demanding innovation, is not able to innovation, is doomed to decline and extinction.
 - Free enterprise cannot be justified as being good for business. It can be justified only as being good for society.
 - Shoes are real. Money is an end result.
 - The only real difference between one organization and another is the performance of its people.
 - I no longer think that learning how to manage people, especially subordinates, is the most important for executives to learn. I am teaching above all else, how to manage oneself.
 - Not to innovate is the single largest reason for the decline of existing organizations. Not to know how to manage is the single largest reason for the failure of new ventures.
 - Important decisions are risky. They should be controversial. Acclamation means that nobody has done the homework.
 - Work is a process, and any process needs to be controlled. To make work productive, therefore, requires building the appropriate controls into the process of work.
 - The large organization has to learn to innovate, or it won’t survive.
 - The computer actually may have aggravated management’s degenerative tendency to focus inward on costs.
 - Businesses are not paid to reform customers. They are paid to satisfy customers.
 - Institutions mistake good intentions for objectives. They say “health care”; that’s an intention, not an objective.
 - No other area offers richer opportunities for successful innovation than the unexpected success.
 - We do not need more laws. No country suffers from a shortage of laws. We need a new model .
 - Tomorrow always arrives. It is always different. And even the mightiest company is in trouble if it has not worked on the future. Being surprised by what happens is a risk that even the largest and richest company cannot afford, and even the smallest business need not run.
 - The moment people talk of “implementing” instead of “doing,” and of “finalizing” instead of “finishing,” the organization is already running a fever.
 - Follow effective action with quiet reflection.
 - The honest work of yesterday has lost its social status, its social esteem.
 - The individual is the central, rarest, most precious capital resource of our society.
 - Almost everybody today believes that nothing in economic history has ever moved as fast as, or had a greater impact than, the Information Revolution. But the Industrial Revolution moved at least as fast in the same time span, and had probably an equal impact if not a greater one.
 - If a business is to be considered a continuous process, instead of a series of disjointed stop-and-go events, then the economic universe in which a business operates-and all the major events within it-must have rhyme, rhythm, or reason.
 - Communication always makes demands. It always demands that the recipient become somebody, do something, believe something. It always appeals to motivation.
 - The Welfare State, which begun in Imperial Germany for the truly indigent and disabled, has now become “everybody’s entitlement” and an increasing burden on those who produce.
 - I’m better about things than about people. I’m more interested in people, but I’m better at ideas.
 - History has been written not by the most talented but by the most motivated.
