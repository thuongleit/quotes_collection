 - Change life! Change Society! These ideas lose completely their meaning without producing an appropriate space. A lesson to be learned from soviet constructivists from the 1920s and 30s, and of their failure, is that new social relations demand a new space, and vice-versa.
 - A revolution that does not produce a new space has not realized its full potential.
 - In this loveless everyday life eroticism is a substitute for love.
 - The users space is lived – not represented or conceived.
 - As it develops, then, the concept of social space becomes broader. It infiltrates, even invades, the concept of production, becoming part – perhaps the essential part – of its content.
