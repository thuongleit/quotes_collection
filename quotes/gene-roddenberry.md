 - Time is the fire in which we burn.
 - The glory of creation is in its infinite diversity.
 - If man is to survive, he will have learned to take a delight in the essential differences between men and between cultures. He will learn that differences in ideas and attitudes are a delight, part of life’s exciting variety, not something to fear.
 - To be different is not necessarily to be ugly; to have a different idea is not necessarily to be wrong. The worst possible thing is for all of us to begin to look and talk and act and think alike.
 - I believe in humanity. We are an incredible species. We’re still just a child creature, we’re still being nasty to each other. And all children go through those phases. We’re growing up, we’re moving into adolescence now. When we grow up – man, we’re going to be something!
 - It is the struggle itself that is most important. We must strive to be more than we are. It does not matter that we will not reach our ultimate goal. The effort itself yields its own reward.

 - In the 24th century there will be no hunger, there will be no greed, and all the children will know how to read.
 - I’m in a period of growth and expansion. I’m taking long, hard looks at the world and what’s happening in it, analyzing and thinking. I’m trying to become acquainted with the universe – with the part of it I occupy – and trying to settle, for myself, what my relationship with it is.

 - If this is your God, he’s not very impressive. He has so many psychological problems; he’s so insecure. He demands worship every seven days. He goes out and creates faulty humans and then blames them for his own mistakes. He’s a pretty poor excuse for a Supreme Being.

 - They said God was on high and he controlled the world and therefore we must pray against Satan. Well, if God controls the world, he controls Satan. For me, religion was full of misstatements and reaches of logic that I just couldn’t agree with.
 - I wish I had more control, more like Edgar Rice Burroughs had, but I’m a realist, too. I work in television. I don’t know that I would want to spend the rest of my life controlling my characters.
 - Art is really people asking the eternal question, “What is it all about?”
 - I think God is as much a basic ingredient in the universe as neutrons and positrons. This is the prime force, when we look around the universe.
