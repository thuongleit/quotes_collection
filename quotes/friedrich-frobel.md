 - Children are like tiny flowers: They are varied and need care, but each is beautiful alone and glorious when seen in the community of peers.
 - Children must master the language of things before they master the language of words.
 - To learn a thing in life and through doing is much more developing, cultivating, and strengthening than to learn it merely through the verbal communication of ideas.
 - Play is the highest expression of human development in childhood for it alone is the free expression of what is in a childâ€™s soul.
