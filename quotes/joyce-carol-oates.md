 - The brain is a muscle of busy hills, the struggle of unthought things with things eternally thought.
 - We are stimulated to emotional response, not by works that confirm our sense of the world, but by works that challenge it.

 - Life is like boxing in many unsettling respects. But boxing is only like boxing.
 - Honorary degrees and lifetime achievement awards are very encouraging. I know that it might sound strange that a writer who has published many books still needs encouragement, but this is true.

 - The folly of war is that it can have no natural end except in the extinction an entire people.

 - Fame’s carapace does not allow for easy breathing.
 - Productivity is a relative matter. And it’s really insignificant: What is ultimately important is a writer’s strongest books.

 - The suicide does not play the game, does not observe the rules. He leaves the party too soon, and leaves the other guests painfully uncomfortable.

 - God’s blessing is not always to be distinguished from His wrath.

 - Nothing is accidental in the universe – this is one of my Laws of Physics – except the entire universe itself, which is Pure Accident, pure divinity.

 - The punishment – to the body, the brain, the spirit – a man must endure to become even a moderately good boxer is inconceivable to most of us whose idea of personal risk is largely ego-related or emotional.
 - I wrote a novel called ‘Blonde,’ which is about Norma Jean Baker, who becomes Marilyn Monroe, which I called a fictitious biography. That uses the material as if it were myth – that Marilyn Monroe is like this mythical figure in our culture.
 - Without craft, art remains private. Without art, craft is merely hackwork.

 - Near the point of impact, time acelerates to the speed of light.
 - As a teacher at Princeton, I’m surrounded by people who work hard so I just make good use of my time. And I don’t really think of it as work – writing a novel, in one sense, is a problem-solving exercise.

 - Princeton is quite integrated. Women are professors at Princeton. Women are students at Princeton. That began in the 1970s.
 - That’s how a thing starts out real then ends up just an idea.
 - For obviously the advantage for most writers is that no one sees them. The writer is invisible, which confers power.
 - As a child. I grew up on a small farm, so I did a lot of drawings of animals, chickens and people. At the bottom of every page, I’d put a strange scribble. I was emulating adult handwriting, though I didn’t actually know how to write.

 - I had forgotten that time wasn’t fixed like concrete but in fact was fluid as sand, or water. I had forgotten that even misery can end.

 - A lot of widows feel that they have betrayed their spouse by continuing to live. It’s deranged thinking. I know that, but that doesn’t stop you feeling it.

 - The regional voice is the universal voice.
 - Society is the picnic certain individuals leave early, the party they fail to enjoy, the musical comedy they find not worth the price of admission.

 - The only people who claim that money is not important are people who have enough money so that they are relieved of the ugly burden of thinking about it.
 - Any writer who has difficulty in writing is probably not onto his true subject, but wasting time with false, petty goals; as soon as you connect with your true subject you will write.
 - There should really not be anything gratuitous in a work of art. Sometimes what seems as if it’s gratuitous may be a passage in which a character is being characterized so that the reader comes to know him or her better.

 - My role models were childless: Virginia Woolf, Jane Austen, George Eliot, the Brontes.

 - Ambitious, absorbing, and poignantly moving.
 - The despairing soul is a rebel.
 - I never really knew I wanted to ‘be’ a writer, but I was always writing from a very young age. It became more conscious as an ideal when I was in my twenties.
 - Why the need, rising in some very nearly to the level of compulsion, to verify experience by way of language?-to scrupulously record and preserve the very passing of Time?
 - Our enemy is by tradition our savior, in preventing us from superficiality.
 - Where there must be a choice, a girl will choose Daddy. Even if you are Mommy, you concede that this must be so: you remember when you were a girl, too.

 - None of the rest of my life figures here.
 - Like most people, I can be very easily hurt.

 - Detroit, my ‘great’ subject, made me the person I am, consequently the writer I am – for better or worse.
 - Novels usually evolve out of ‘character.’ Characters generate stories, and the shape of a novel is entirely imagined but should have an aesthetic coherence.
 - A mouth of no distinction but well practiced, before I entered my teens, in irony. For what is irony but the repository of hurt? And what is hurt but the repository of hope?
 - I don’t think that writer’s block exists really. I think that when you’re trying to do something prematurely, it just won’t come. Certain subjects just need time, as I’ve learned over and over again. You’ve got to wait before you write about them.

 - When a marriage ends, who is left to understand it?
 - When I complete a novel I set it aside, and begin work on short stories, and eventually another long work. When I complete that novel I return to the earlier novel and rewrite much of it. In the meantime the second novel lies in a desk drawer.

 - Much of my writing is energized by unresolved memories – something like ghosts in the psychological sense.
 - The novel is perhaps the highest art form because it so closely resembles life: it is about human relationships. It’s technique, page by page, resembles our technique of living day by day-a way of relating.
 - It seems disingenuous to ask a writer why she, or he, is writing about a violent subject when the world and history are filled with violence.

 - The appeal of writing is primarily the investigation of mystery.
 - The body can’t distinguish between cleansing and punishing for the body is ignorant, and mute besides.
 - We are the species that clamors to be lied to.
 - Henry James’s later works would have been better had he resisted that curious sort of self-indulgence, dictating to a secretary. The roaming garrulousness of ordinary speech is usually corrected when it’s transcribed into written prose.
 - Even if I seemed to remember, I could not know. For just to remember something is not to know if it really happened. That is a primary fact of the inner life, the most difficult fact with which we must live.
 - I learned you don’t discover the evidence of any cause in its result.
 - How lawyers make work for one another! You’re all priests, worshipping the same god. No wonder you adore one another.

 - A writer who has published as many books as I have has developed, of necessity, a hide like a rhino’s, while inside there dwells a frail, hopeful butterfly of a spirit.
 - Who is to blame for this most recent of sports disgraces in America? The culture that flings young athletes like Tyson up out of obscurity, makes millionaires of them and watches them self-destruct?

 - The novel is the affliction for which only the novel is the cure.
 - I think whenever we think of our hometowns, we tend to think of very specific people: with whom you rode on the school bus, who was your next door neighbor you were playing with, who your girlfriend was. It’s always something very specific.
 - I compose most of my tweets with care, as if they were aphorisms – they are not usually dashed-off. Sometimes I’m surprised by the high, poetic quality of Twitter – it lends itself to a surreal sort of self-expression.
 - I have read on a Kindle. But the Kindle we had only worked for about eight months then it stopped working. You don’t have to get books repaired.
 - And that’s the insult of it, how always it comes back to a woman being a “good” mother in the world’s eyes or a “bad” mother, how everything in a woman’s life is funneled through her body between her legs.
 - After love a formal feeling comes.
 - How lovely this world is, really: one simply has to look.
 - Fiction that adds up, that suggests a “logical consistency,” or an explanation of some kind, is surely second-rate fiction; for the truth of life is its mystery.
 - An actress wants to be seen. An actress wants to be loved. By multitudes of people, not just one lone man.
 - As soon as I moved to Princeton in 1978, I became fascinated by local history, much of it Revolutionary War-era; and I became fascinated by the presidency of Woodrow Wilson at Princeton University.
 - You need so much energy and encouragement to write that if someone says something negative, some of that energy goes.
 - There was a Greek philosopher who taught that, of all things, not to have been born is the sweetest state. But I believe sleep is the sweetest state. You’re dead, yet alive. There’s no sensation so exquisite.
 - Nothing comes of so many things, if you have patience.
 - Perhaps the inevitable tragedy of our complex civilization is that we must be specialists in our fields – and our fields have become increasingly difficult, so that communication is nearly impossible.
 - It must happen to everyone. The last time you make love, you can’t know it will be the last.
 - It is only through disruptions and confusion that we grow, jarred out of ourselves by the collision of someone else’s private world with our own.
 - What does it mean to be born? After we die, will it be the same thing as it was before we were born? Or a different kind of nothingness? Because there might be knowledge then. Memory.

 - Among many of my friends and acquaintances, I seem to be one of the very few individuals who felt or feels no ambivalence about my mother. All my feelings for my mother were positive, very strong and abiding.
