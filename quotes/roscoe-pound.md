 - The law must be stable, but it must not stand still.
 - Law is experience developed by reason and applied continually to further experience.
 - Jury lawlessness is the greatest corrective of law in its actual administration.
 - Organized labor still has privileges and legal immunities that even kings and governments lost years ago.
 - Civilization involves subjection of force to reason, and the agency of this subjection is law.
