 - Art is Knowledge at the service of emotion.
 - Why must we be eternally on our knees before the Kants and Hugos?
 - We too could wrest iron from the bowels of the earth and fashion it into ships and machines.
 - Was not from a mixture of two races that the Titans sprang?
 - All praise to the masters indeed, but we too could produce a Kant or a Hugo.
 - We could raise prodigious cities and create nations, and explore the universe.
