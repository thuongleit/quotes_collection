 - If I knew you and you knew me- If both of us could clearly see, And with an inner sight divine The meaning of your heart and mine I’m sure that we would differ less And clasp our hands in friendliness: Our thoughts would pleasantly agree, If I knew you and you knew me.
 - Do not falter or shrink; But just think out your work, And just work out your think.
 - A rose to the living is more Than sumptuous wreaths to the dead.
 - Though life is made up of mere bubbles ’tis better than many have, for while we’ve a whole lot of troubles the most of them never occur.
 - No man can feel himself alone The while he bravely stands Between the best friends ever known His two good, honest hands.
