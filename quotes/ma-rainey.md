 - This be an empty world without the blues.
 - They hear it come out, but they don’t know how it got there. They don’t understand that’s life’s way of talking. You don’t sing to feel better. You sing cause that’s a way of understanding life.
 - A tune’s like a staircase – walk up on it.
 - I can’t tell my future, so I’m going to tell my past.
