 - Natural disasters are terrifying – that loss of control, this feeling that something is just going to randomly end your life for absolutely no reason is terrifying. But, what scares me is the human reaction to it and how people behave when the rules of civility and society are obliterated.
 - I think that many people are ashamed when they feel afraid. There’s this thing in our society that you’re not allowed to feel scared. You have to be a man and put on a brave face, but we all have fears.
 - I have so many different projects, I hear voices in my head – the characters talking all at once – and I have to write to make them stop.

 - When I was 22, I had this horrible psoriasis outbreak. It was all over my legs, I couldn’t walk because my legs were cracked and bleeding. Weird things like that can happen to your body.

 - For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.

 - I look at careers like Ben Stiller and think that’s a great career to have where you’re doing movies that you write and direct, and also act in films, although he’s primarily an actor.

 - I’d love to see us get to a point where you can make a movie and not worry about the limits of the violence. Then I think they’d get so violent that people would get bored of it.
 - You do need an outlet to release all of those fears. You build it up and then, when you go to a movie theater, it’s the last place that it’s socially acceptable to be terrified. It’s saying that, for the next 90 minutes, you’re allowed to be afraid and you’re not a coward for feeling that way.
 - When people direct insults at me, I can take it.
