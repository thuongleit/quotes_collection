 - I feel I’m anonymous in my work. When I look at the pictures, I never see myself; they aren’t self-portraits. Sometimes I disappear.
 - Nowadays, with digital printing, it’s so easy to make everything perfect, which is not always a good idea. Sometimes the mistakes are really what make a piece.
 - Some people have told me they remember the film that one of my images is derived from, but in fact I had no film in mind at all.
 - Dreamers are those who have achieved in love and life, because it is a dream that got them there.
 - Everyone thinks these are self-portraits but they aren’t meant to be. I just use myself as a model because I know I can push myself to extremes, make each shot as ugly or goofy or silly as possible.
 - I’m really just using the mirror to summon something I don’t even know until I see it.
 - I didn’t think of what I was doing as political. To me it was a way to make the best out of what I liked to do privately, which was to dress up.
 - I didn’t have any interest in traditional art.
 - Inconsiderate, rude behavior drives me nuts. And I guess the inconsiderate rudeness of social ineptitude definitely fuels my work.
 - I don’t think I can see the world through other people’s eyes, but I can capture an attitude or a look that makes others think I can. I have an appreciation for why people choose to look the way they do. But I can’t know what they experience.
 - I was meticulously copying other art and then I realized I could just use a camera and put my time into an idea instead.
 - My dad was such a bigot. He was a horrible, self-centred person. He was really racist and he’d talk about the Jews and blacks and Catholics even.
 - I didn’t want to make ‘high’ art, I had no interest in using paint, I wanted to find something that anyone could relate to without knowing about contemporary art. I wasn’t thinking in terms of precious prints or archival quality; I didn’t want the work to seem like a commodity.
 - When I do work, I get so much done in such a concentrated time that once I’m through a series, I’m so drained I don’t want to get near the camera.
 - I think people are more apt to believe photographs, especially if it’s something fantastic. They’re willing to be more gullible. Sometimes they want fantasy. Even if they know it’s fake they can believe anything. People are accustomed to being told what to believe in.
 - I wanted to create something that people could relate to without having read a book about it beforehand.

 - I’m trying to make other people recognize something of themselves rather than me.
 - The still must tease with the promise of a story the viewer of it itches to be told.
 - People think because it’s photography it’s not worth as much, and because it’s a woman artist, you’re still not getting as much – there’s still definitely that happening. I’m still really competitive when it comes to, I guess, the male painters and male artists. I still think that’s really unfair.

 - My ideas are not developed before I actually do the pieces.

 - We’re all products of what we want to project to the world. Even people who don’t spend any time, or think they don’t, on preparing themselves for the world out there – I think that ultimately they have for their whole lives groomed themselves to be a certain way, to present a face to the world.
 - The models have always been the least interesting thing about fashion.
 - I don’t analyze what I’m doing. I’ve read convincing interpretations of my work, and sometimes I’ve noticed something that I wasn’t aware of, but I think, at this point, people read into my work out of habit. Or I’m just very, very smart.
