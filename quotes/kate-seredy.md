 - Kill the snake of doubt in your soul, crush the worms of fear in your heart and mountains will move out of your way.
 - For yesterday and for all tomorrows, we dance the best we know.
 - There are hurts so deep that one cannot reach them or heal them with words.
 - I make money using my brains and lose money listening to my heart. But in the long run my books balance pretty well.
 - Nothing fine and noble will ever perish from the earth as long as there are hearts to remember.
