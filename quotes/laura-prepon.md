 - When you’re in prison, there’s no hiding. These women are not hiding behind towels and shower curtains. They go to the bathroom with no doors on the stalls. It would actually look weird, if these women were hiding.

 - On a lot of shows that I’ve done, we had the same directors, which was cool. But then, it’s also great to do shows where the director changes every week because you get to see all these different personalities and see what you like dealing with better, as an actor. But, Jodie was amazing.
