 - The very truths that gave birth to the Pentecostal movement are today generally rejected as too strong.
 - The deepest repentance and humility and our own frailty and weakness must be realized before we can know Godâ€™s strength.
 - When HOLINESS loses its sweetness it is a fierce thing to come in contact with.
