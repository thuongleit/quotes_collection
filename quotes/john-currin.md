 - Your style is who you are when you’re not trying to be clever or better than you actually are.
 - There is a fascination with violence and power in all modernism, and I sort of saw classic modernism as being more similar to Wyndham Lewis than to the Renaissance. It’s not about flow and the presence of humanism and all those things.
