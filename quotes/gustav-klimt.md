 - Art is a line around your thoughts.
 - There is always hope, as long as the canvases are empty.
 - I have the gift of neither the spoken nor the written word, especially if I have to say something about myself or my work. Whoever wants to know something about me -as an artist, the only notable thing- ought to look carefully at my pictures and try and see in them what I am and what I want to do.
 - There is no self-portrait of me.
 - True relaxation, which would do me the world of good, does not exist for me.
 - There is nothing that special to see when looking at me.
 - Although even when I am being idle I have plenty of food for thought both early and late – thoughts both about and not about art.
 - I can paint and draw. I believe this myself and a few other people say that they believe this too. But I’m not certain of whether it’s true.
 - Even when I have to write a simple letter I’m scared stiff as if faced with looming seasickness.
 - Sometimes I miss out the morning’s painting session and instead study my Japanese books in the open.
 - There is nothing that special to see when looking at me. I’m a painter who paints day in day out, from morning till evening – figure pictures and landscapes, more rarely portraits.
 - On my first days here I did not start work immediately but, as planned, I took it easy for a few days – flicked through books, studied Japanese art a little.
 - After tea it’s back to painting – a large poplar at dusk with a gathering storm. From time to time instead of this evening painting session I go bowling in one of the neighbouring villages, but not very often.
 - Whoever wants to know something about me – as an artist which alone is significant – they should look attentively at my pictures and there seek to recognise what I am and what I want.
