 - You serve the best by doing what you love the most.
 - I don’t think you understand what levels or what fears until you have a child of your own. I mean, I’ve never loved someone so much and I’ve never been so afraid in my life. And the truth is I would kill someone, whoever tried to hurt him. I would. I have no doubt about it.
