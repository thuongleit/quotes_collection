 - Do not let people put you down. Believe in yourself and stand for yourself and trust yourself.
 - You do not need to justify asking questions. But if you think you have found answers, you do not have the right to remain silent.
 - But the more insidious enemies of religion recognize but deplore religionâ€™s remarkable influence in the world order.
 - Religion is something people do together to face urgent problems and to resolve them by appealing to truths that seem self-evident to them.
