 - I am not in competition with my peers; I am in competition with myself.
 - Drugs, alcohol and ego. They are a bad mix.
 - Honest, I listen to classical mostly. It keeps my mind fresh to write rock songs.
 - Peter Baltes was the best bassist I ever played with.
 - If I never sang on a record again I can still look at my walls. They are covered floor to ceiling with gold and platinum records from all over the world.
