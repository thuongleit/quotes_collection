 - Every science touches art at some points â€“ every art has its scientific side; the worst man of science is he who is never an artist, and the worst artist is he who is never a man of science.
 - The worst scientist is he who is not an artist; the worst artist is he who is no scientist.
 - All science touches on art; all art has its scientific side.
 - You should treat as many patients as possible with the new drugs while they still have the power to heal.
 - Use new drugs quickly, while they still work.
