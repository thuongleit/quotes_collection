 - The greatest difficulty always comes right before the birth of a dream.
 - Friend, there’s no greater investment in life than in being a people builder. Relationships are more important than our accomplishments.

 - Quit worrying about what other people think and just be who God made you to be. If you will run your race, God will take care of your critics.

 - Being successful doesn’t necessarily make you great. What makes you great is when you reach back and help somebody else become great.
 - Quit dwelling on the negative things people have said about you. You don’t have to have everyone’s approval. You have God’s approval.
 - Sometimes you have to put your own dreams on hold temporarily so you can help release a dream in somebody else. What you make happen for others, God will make happen for you.
 - My core message is that God has got a good plan for your lives, and we must trust Him, and let go of the past. That’s my main message.
 - I don’t have to figure out how God is going to solve my problem. I don’t have to understand how He’s going to bring it to pass. That’s His responsibility. My job is to simply believe that He will.
 - You can live your life angry, bitter, mad at somebody or even guilty, not letting go of your own mistakes, but you won’t receive the good things God has in store.
 - He is still in control. He still has you in the palm of His hand.

 - You can be in the storm, but don’t let the storm get in you.
 - You have a destiny to fulfill, something greater than you’ve ever even imagined. But if you’re going to become all you were created to be, you’ve got to take off the “average” label.
 - And afterward, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your old men will dream dreams, your young men will see visions.
 - Your enemies, your critics, the people that are trying to push you down-God can use them to push you up.
 - When you go through enough dark places, you don’t complain about little things. You don’t lose your joy because you got stuck in traffic; you don’t get offended because a coworker was rude to you. You’ve been through too much to let that sour you.
 - If you are against yourself, you will never reach your highest potential. And when you criticize yourself, you’re criticizing God.
