 - I think that a visual artist’s philosophy develops much more freely than a writer’s or a thinker’s philosophy. It is not so disciplined. The photographer works with both his eyes and his mind.
 - I think that light and shadow have exactly the same duality that exists between life and death.
 - Shoot what you see, not what you think.
 - I give the moment permanence.
 - There is no other art with as great a democratic capacity as photography.
 - The word ‘art’ is very slippery. It really has no importance in relation to one’s work. I work for the pleasure, for the pleasure of the work, and everything else is a matter for the critics.
