 - A leader is admired, a boss is feared.
 - You watch the game, you don’t see Busquets. You watch Busquets, you see the whole game.
 - Messi or Ronaldo? I prefer Messi because he is more of a street player.
 - If I were a player, I would like to be like Busquets.
 - Technically he is perfect and he plays so naturally, almost without effort. It’s like when Roger Federer plays tennis, he barely sweats.

 - We are in a world that is quite extremist and extremism makes more noise. Normality does not sell.
 - I just wanted to defend football, which is not always easy to do. Those of us who have been in the sport so many years now realise we must protect it and look after it. I was speaking about football, what it means. It is our profession, it has been our lives, and we must take care of it a little.
