 - If history were a photograph of the past it would be flat and uninspiring. Happily, it is a painting; and, like all works of art, it fails of the highest truth unless imagination and ideas are mixed with the paints.
 - History is never above the melee. It is not allowed to be neutral, but forced to enlist in every army.
 - History is the sextant of states which, tossed by wind and current, would be lost in confusion if they could not fix their position.
