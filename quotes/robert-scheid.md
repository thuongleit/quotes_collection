 - The law of gratitude is universal. It is a natural function of the soul. All things upon this earth or in the universe operate and respond to love and praise.
 - Praise, or gratitude, is love or faith in action.
 - Being thankful is also the law of increase. What we give thanks for is automatically multiplied. If we have only a dime and give thanks for it, it will soon be increased. If we resent our position and dwell upon what we lack, that is exactly what we get back.
 - The biggest problem about looking at a problem is looking at it. When we finally find or face it, it becomes harmless and easy to solve.
 - The only person to whom your love belongs is the one to whom your love belongs.
 - Our hearts and souls are always the departing point for all thought, feeling and action.
 - To love each otherâ€™s essence and to be one-what could be more divine!
