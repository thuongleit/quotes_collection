 - It is always too soon to quit.
 - Faith makes the uplook good, the outlook bright, the inlook favorable, and the future glorious.
 - Don’t question in the dark what God showed you in the light.
 - Meekness is marked by silence in the face of abuse and infamy, by submission to God’s way, which is higher than our way as heaven is higher than the earth, by submissiveness to others for their welfare. It is the source of inexpressible joy and contentment.
 - Evangelical faith without Christian ethics is a travesty on the gospel.
