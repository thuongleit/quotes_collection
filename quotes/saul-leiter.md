 - I don’t have a philosophy. I have a camera.
 - I spent a great deal of my life being ignored. I was always very happy that way. Being ignored is a great privilege. That is how I think I learned to see what others do not see and to react to situations differently. I simply looked at the world, not really prepared for anything.
 - I go out to take a walk, I see something, I take a picture. I take photographs. I have avoided profound explanations of what I do.
 - Seeing is a neglected enterprise.
 - I don’t have a philosophy. I have a camera. I look into the camera and take pictures. My photographs are the tiniest part of what I see that could be photographed. They are fragments of endless possibilities.
 - When we do not know why the photographer has taken a picture and when we do not know why we are looking at it, all of a sudden we discover something that we start seeing. I like this confusion.

 - The important thing in life is not what you get, but what you throw out.
