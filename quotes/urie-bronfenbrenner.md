 - In order to develop normally, a child requires progressively more complex joint activity with one or more adults who have an irrational emotional relationship with the child. Somebody’s got to be crazy about that kid. That’s number one. First, last and always.
 - There is no more critical indicator of the future of a society than the character, competence, and integrity of its youth.
 - No society can long sustain itself unless its members have learned the sensitivities, motivations and skills involved in assisting and caring for other human beings.
 - The primary danger of the television screen lies not so much in the behavior it produces as the behavior it prevents-the talks, the games, the family activities and the arguments through which much of the child’s learning takes place and his character is formed.

 - Particular attention should be given to the opportunities which the environment presents or precludes for involvement of children with persons both older and younger than themselves.
