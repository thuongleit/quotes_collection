 - I think that it’s important for every single person, no matter what they do in life, to participate in the well-being of humanity and the planet. Don’t let a year go by knowing you didn’t make an effort to do something – no matter how small – outside your own problems and drama.
 - Art and activism seem to go together naturally, the idea being that if you’re an entertainer, you can have a voice, and if you have a voice, you can make a difference.

 - I love to cook for my husband and daughter. I enjoy going to the market for fresh vegetables.

 - I’m suspicious of people who talk about their feelings to the whole world.
 - Botox, trust me I’ve been tempted – but I resist! Think about what happens to your muscles – and your skin – if you’re sick and don’t move for a few days. It all atrophies! Plus, if you freeze a muscle in your face, other muscles have to compensate! And once you stop, what does that look like?
 - Make yourself smell nice. I even wear perfume sometimes when I’m alone.
 - What you need is one black dress I call Plan B. It doesn’t have to be fabulous, it just looks good, covers up the problems and is neutral enough for dinner, business, a date, a funeral. You don’t overwear it, you don’t overwash it, because the Plan B is – gold.
 - Find your own style. Don’t spend your savings trying to be someone else. You’re not more important, smarter, or prettier because you wear a designer dress.
 - When I finally decided to leave school and pursue acting, my parents didn’t take it very lightly. My friends thought that it was the tackiest thing they’d ever heard of. Acting was really beneath them. They couldn’t believe that I would want to become an actress. Not now, of course.

 - I’m concerned about my daughter because she will not believe in Santa Claus. No matter what I say to her, she just doesn’t buy it, and she’s 2. I refuse to give it up. I say, ‘There is a Santa Claus,’ and she says, ‘Okay, Mommy. In pretend world, right?’ She really doesn’t believe.
 - I don’t believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesn’t have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English, not Spanish. Her success is very important because she represents a different culture, but it doesn’t help me.
 - When I’m doing a movie, that’s when I relax. As stressful as it can be, as much pressure as it should be, making movies is still the place where I feel the most at ease and I truly enjoy it. That’s why I make so many.
 - I don’t see women and think of them as competition or with judgment. Women really move me. I feel connected to all kinds of women. I am angry because I think we’ve been mistreated throughout history in different countries, including America. I admire women.

 - Leave it to the Catholics to destroy existence.
 - It doesnt matter what you have faith in, just that you have faith.

 - I’ve never had anything done on my face. I’ve never had dermabrasion or peels or injections of any kind, nothing.
