 - Michael Jackson was a poor black boy who grew up to be a rich white woman.

 - As I have pointed out time and again, it’s a hell of a lot cheaper to send little kids to school than it is to let them grow up into young thugs who have to be sent to prison, not to mention the savings in the wear and tear on the nerves, property, and safety of the rest of the citizenry.
 - Next time I tell you someone from Texas should not be president of the United States, please pay attention.

 - Nice is a pallid virtue. Not like honesty or courage or perseverance. On the other hand, in a nation notably lacking in civility, there is much to be said for nice.
