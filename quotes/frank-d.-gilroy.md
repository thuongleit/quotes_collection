 - I hate Sunday, and I don’t think I’ll ever get over it. But I’m going to try.
 - I sometimes like to sit in the silence and darkness and listen to my heart shine.
 - The Lord doesn’t want anybody in His house who has to be dragged there.
 - The world doesn’t owe anyone a living – including veterans.
