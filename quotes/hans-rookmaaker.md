 - Jesus didn’t come to make us Christian. Jesus came to make us fully human.
 - What is Christian in art does not lie in the theme but in the spirit of it, in its wisdom and the understanding of reality it reflects.
 - Art is a form of play rejoicing before the face of God.
 - Our world has changed for better or for worse. It is for us to find truth and beauty for today, constantly re-applying the truth of God’s word to our own time and our contemporary situation.
 - We do not know what we see, but we see what we know.
