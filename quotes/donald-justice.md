 - Men at forty Learn to close softly The doors to rooms they will not be Coming back to.
 - How shall I speak of Doom, and ours in special, But as of something altogether common?
 - There is no way to ease the burden. The voyage leads on from harm to harm, A land of others and of silence.
 - Nostalgias were peeled from it long ago.
