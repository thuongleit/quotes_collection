 - A woman should live with two men; one more a lover and the other more a friend.
 - I paint pictures which do not exist and which I would like to see.
 - Paintings, like dreams, have a life of their own and I have always painted very much the way I dream.
 - Marriage never appealed to me, I have never lived with one person. Since I was 18, I’ve always preferred to live in a sort of community – A big house with my atelier and cats and friends, one with a man who was rather a lover and another who was rather a friend. And it has always worked.
 - I always imagined I would have a life very different from the one that was imagined for me, but I understood from a very early time that I would have to revolt in order to make that life. Now I am convinced that in any creativity there exists this element of revolt.
