 - Sustainability is treating ourselves and our environment as if we are to live on this earth forever.
 - With a healthy environment all our lives are enriched – without it our lives are diminished. The environment is and will always be number one – One Life, One World, Our Future.
 - Making ourselves the solution, rather than part of the problem is our greatest challenge.
 - No-one can do everything for the environment, but every-one can do something to make a better world.
 - We need to believe in a bright, compelling and sustainable future. Fear neither motivates people long-term nor brings out the best in them. Hope is a powerful motivator.
