 - You cannot be known Better than I know you.
 - A woman is more beautiful than the world in which I live; and so I close my eyes.
 - The language of my love does not belong to human language, my human body does not touch the flesh of my love.
 - We want to be, when we are young, A little man. I would like to be a big child, Stronger and fairer than a man, And more lucid than a child.
 - The earth is blue like an orange.
 - The front windows as are the watchmen of grief – I’ve been looking beyond expectation – Beyond myself – and I do not know as I love you – Which one of us is missing.
 - The curve of your eyes goes around my heart, A round of dance and sweetness, Halo of time, nocturnal and safe cradle, And if I don’t know any more all that I’ve lived through It’s because I haven’t always been seen by you.
 - Even when we sleep we watch over one another.
 - Your eyes in which I travel Have given to signs along the roads A meaning alien to the earth.
 - Elephants are contagious.
 - The poet is he who inspires, rather than he who is inspired.
