 - At school I had a really hard time being a guitar player. It’s like being a male ballerina in a way. It’s not the norm.
 - It’s a guy thing, playing the guitar. Being a female and trying to go to the same auditions as the guys, it’s pretty hard.
 - Sometimes I write from personal experience, but so much depends on what mood I’m in. If I’m in a good mood, I’ll write happier songs.
 - I get really excited about collaborating because by the end of the day you have something that you never thought you’d have. I was really happy about writing “Bad News” and a bunch of other stuff on the record that came out so well.
 - I listen to everything. My I-Pod’s really diverse-from guitar instrumentals to Rascal Flatts to Usher.
 - I wanted to have all the songs to be the strongest they could be and all the choruses to be catchy. One of those records you could put in your car and just drive and not have to change it.
 - The song could start with a riff that I base the song around. Or a chord progression or a melody I have, I just write a story about it. Lyric-wise, it’s cool to have someone else’s input too.
