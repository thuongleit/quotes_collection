 - Unless and until our society recognizes cyber bullying for what it is, the suffering of thousands of silent victims will continue.
 - Cyber bullies can hide behind a mask of anonymity online, and do not need direct physical access to their victims to do unimaginable harm.

 - Girls who lead turn in to women who thrive.
 - Simply stated, girls want role models and mentors.
 - Girl Scouts is such an iconic organization that it’s easy to overlook how daring an idea it was for founder Juliette Gordon Low to gather those first 18 girls in that troop in Savannah, Georgia. It was 1912, after all, and women wouldn’t earn the right to vote for another eight years.

 - Many people don’t know, but American Girl Scouts get to travel the world, and that’s a very good thing, as the more we can expose our young people to other cultures, the better off we’ll be in this increasingly globalized environment.
 - Sometimes when I speak to groups or I’m interviewed by a journalist, I ask them to imagine their communities without Girl Scouts – to imagine the thousands of food drives and clothing and toy collections that would never take place if not for Girl Scouts.
