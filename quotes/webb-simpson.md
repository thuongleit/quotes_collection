 - It feels great to win and I can’t be more thankful to the Lord for walking me through every step. God was and is so faithful every time.
 - I didn’t want to settle or become complacent after winning a major, I wanted to stay hungry. It’s easy to do. It’s easy to win a big tournament and kind of get a little lazy, so it’s been a good motivator for me to work a little harder.
 - Apart from golf, it was a great week.
