 - I love argument, I love debate. I don’t expect anyone just to sit there and agree with me, that’s not their job.

 - To cure the British disease with socialism was like trying to cure leukaemia with leeches.
 - As prime minister, I worked closely with Ronald Reagan for eight of the most important years of all our lives. We talked regularly both before and after his presidency. And I have had time and cause to reflect on what made him a great president.

 - Consensus is the negation of leadership.
 - I came to office with one deliberate intent: to change Britain from a dependent to a self-reliant society – from a give-it-to-me, to a do-it-yourself nation. A get-up-and-go, instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for-it Britain.

 - Marxists get up early to further their cause. We must get up even earlier to defend our freedom.
 - If you are guided by opinion polls, you are not practicing leadership – you are practicing followership.
 - Terrorism thrives on a free society. The terrorist uses the feelings in a free society to sap the will of civilization to resist. If the terrorist succeeds, he has won and the whole of free society has lost.
 - I was asked whether I was trying to restore Victorian values. I said straight out I was. And I am.
 - You cannot make an omelet without breaking some balls.

 - Russia is bent on world domination.
 - To accuse me of being too inflexible is poppycock.
 - We have become a grandmother.

 - When you’ve spent half your political life dealing with humdrum issues like the environment, it’s exciting to have a real crisis on your hands.

 - We have made too much of one or two people, and we think that they can win or lose elections for us. Don’t be depressed if one particular person transgresses. It doesn’t lose an election unless the Party loses faith in itself.
 - If someone is confronting our essential liberties, if someone is inflicting injuries and harm, by God I’ll confront them!
 - There is no such thing as society: there are individual men and women, and there are families.

 - Let us, then, draw together in the name, not of jingoism, but of justice.
 - Any leader has to have a certain amount of steel in them, so I am not that put out being called the Iron Lady.

 - We do not achieve happiness or salvation in isolation from each other but as members of society.
 - You can’t lead from the crowd.
 - Successful entrepreneurship is ultimately a matter of flair. But there is also a fund of practical knowledge to be acquired and, of course, the right legal and financial framework has to be provided for productive enterprise to develop.

 - Do you think you would ever have heard of Christianity if the Apostles had gone out and said, ‘I believe in consensus?’
 - I can’t bear Britain in decline. I just can’t.

 - I don’t mind how much my Ministers talk, so long as they do what I say.
 - Constitutions have to be written on hearts, not just paper.
 - I have made it quite clear that a unified Ireland was one solution that is out. A second solution was a confederation of two states. That is out. A third solution was joint authority. That is out-that is a derogation of sovereignty.

 - How thin is the crust of order over the fires of human appetite and the lust for naked power.

 - The Kosovo campaign was a just and necessary war. And I believe that Blair – of whom I have many criticisms – in this case showed real determination in conducting it.
 - Whether manufactured by black, white, brown or yellow hands, a widget remains a widget – and it will be bought anywhere if the price and quality are right. The market is a more powerful and more reliable liberating force than government can ever be.
 - There are no personal sympathies in politics.
 - All corporatism – even when practised in societies where hard work, enterprise and cooperation are as highly valued as in Korea – encourages inflexibility, discourages individual accountability, and risks magnifying errors by concealing them.
 - The election of a man committed to the cause of freedom and the renewal of America’s strength has given encouragement to all those who love liberty.

 - Political success is a good deal pleasanter than political failure, but it too brings its problems.
 - When hecklers stand up, I get a mental jump for joy. It gives me something to get my teeth into – and the audiences love it.

 - I have very strong views about Europe. We’re quite the best country. We rescued them. We’re not going to get entangled with them. We’ve got to keep our own independence. Is that clear?

 - Most women are far more intelligent than people give them credit for.
 - The desire to achieve grand utopian plans often poses a grave threat to freedom.
 - During my lifetime most of the problems the world has faced have come, in one fashion or other, from mainland Europe, and the solutions from outside it.
 - We need a free economy not only for the renewed material prosperity it will bring, but because it is indispensable to individual freedom, human dignity and to a more just, more honest society.
 - I just owe almost everything to my father and it’s passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town, in a very modest home, are just the things that I believe have won the election.
 - I applaud strong government, but not overweening government sustained by cronies, ciphers and a personality cult.
 - The patronage state is an arrogant state. It assumes it can spend your money better than you do. Yet it expects you to work for it in the first place.
 - Personal virtue is no substitute for political hard-headedness.
 - The real case against socialism is not its economic inefficiency, though on all sides there is evidence of that. Much more fundamental is its basic immorality.

 - If you lead a country like Britain, a strong country, a country which has taken a lead in world affairs in good times and in bad, a country that is always reliable, then you have to have a touch of iron about you.
 - We must not fall into the trap of projecting our own morality onto the Soviet leaders. They do not share our aspirations, they are not constrained by our ethics, they always consider themselves exempt from the rules that bind other states.
 - The Third World is very much like the First World – just poorer: what works for the West will work for the rest as well.
 - John Gummer just did not have the political clout or credibility to rally the troops. I had appointed him as a sort of nightwatchman, but he seemed to have to sleep on the job.

 - Wars are not caused by the buildup of weapons. They are caused when an aggressor believes he can achieve his objectives at an acceptable price.
 - We are a British nation with British characteristics. Every country can take some small minorities and in many ways they add to the richness and variety of this country. The moment the minority threatens to become a big one, people get frightened.
 - I’ve learned one thing in politics. You don’t take a decision until you have to.
 - We must not fall into the mistake of thinking that it is America that trades with Taiwan or Europe that trades with Asia. The truth is that it is American companies that trade with Taiwanese companies.
 - People think that at the top there isn’t much room. They tend to think of it as an Everest. My message is that there is tons of room at the top.
 - Never in the history of human credit has so much been owed.
 - Israel must never be expected to jeopardize her security: if she was ever foolish enough to do so, and then suffered for it, the backlash against both honest brokers and Palestinians would be immense – ‘land for peace’ must also bring peace.
 - I’m also very much aware that it is you who brought democracy to Chile, you set up a constitution suitable for democracy, you put it into effect, elections were held, and then, in accordance with the result, you stepped down.
 - Isn’t a policy of conventional weapons, with the terrible bombs raining down, with the missiles, with the aircraft, with the submarines, with the torpedoes, with the tanks, with chemical weapons – isn’t that based on the possibility of threat?
 - I love his music because he was my generation. But then again, Elvis is everyone’s generation, and he always will be.

 - Freedom under the law must never be taken for granted.
 - You will only succeed if you know that what you are doing is right and you know how to bring out the best in people.

 - I believe our way of life is infinitely superior for every human being than any which the Communist creed can offer.
 - I do not understand the unilateralists. If they hated nuclear weapons as much as I do they would want them down in the world as a whole. I am the true disarmer, I keep peace and freedom and justice with it.
 - If you go into what I call a bubble boom, every bubble bursts.
