 - I might be able to find out what happened 6,000 years ago but I will never know what happens 6,000 years in the future! And that is not fair, blast it.
 - I don’t finish a lot of the books I read. I get enormous pleasure from reading half f them, two-thirds of them, even incredibly good books. But I don’t feel it’s my duty to finish them. I read the last few pages and find out what happens at the end.
 - We need to actually teach kids that books aren’t like broccoli. You don’t have to eat every bit on your plate. It’s like secret adult’s business. It’s the secret we never, ever tell our children. No adult ever read a book because it’s good for us. We read because it is fun.
 - Death had ruled my life till I met Lady Dance. Her dance had set me free.
 - There is still in many schools complete misapprehension that children with reading difficulties are stupid. It is so easy to teach a child that they’re dumb. There needs to be a recognition that you need different ways to teach children who have got reading problems.

 - I do read very, very quickly. I do process data very quickly. And so I write very quickly. And it is embarrassing because there is a conception that the things that you do quickly are not done well. I think that’s probably one of the reasons I don’t like the idea of prolific.
 - For me books have always been an incredibly solid part of my life, both as escapism and simply as resource.
 - I’m very close to my parents. I admire them and respect them enormously. But my childhood unfortunately coincided with the end of their marriage. They are two people who should never, ever have got married.
