 - The biggest risk is not taking any risk.

 - Virtual Reality is really a new communication platform. By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures.
 - If you’re always under the pressure of real identity, I think that is somewhat of a burden.
 - Hollywood has nothing to do with real life.

 - Books allow you to fully explore a topic and immerse yourself in a deeper way than most media today. I’m looking forward to shifting more of my media diet towards reading books.

 - A guy who makes a new chair doesn’t owe money to everyone who ever built a chair.
 - Facebook is inherently viral.
 - It took 10 years to go from building the initial Smartphone to reaching the mass market. BlackBerry came out in 2003 and it didn’t get to about a billion units until 2013. So I can’t imagine it would be much faster for VR.
 - Connecting the world is really important, and that is something that we want to do. That is why Facebook is here on this planet.
 - The last six years have been a lot of coding and focus and hard work. But maybe it would be fun to remember it as partying and all this crazy drama.
 - It only took me two weeks to build the first version of Facebook because I had so much stuff before then.
 - Free basic internet access should be like dialing 911 in the US or 100 in India.
 - Virtual Reality is going to be an important technology. I am pretty confident about this.

 - Mobile is a lot closer to TV than it is to desktop.
 - In the future, I think you are going to want to capture a whole scene, a room, to be able to transport to that. To be able to stream what you are doing live and have people be able to interact in that space.
 - My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There’s a lot of that in Silicon Valley.
 - It’s tough to say, exactly, what things will look like in three to five years, but there’s a lot of work to do in just moving along the path that we’ve already set out.

 - I updated my grilling app, iGrill, today and it now has Facebook integration that lets you see what other people are grilling right now around the world. Awesome.

 - This is our commitment to users and the people who use our service, is that Facebook’s a free service. It’s free now. It will always be free. We make money through having advertisements and things like that.
 - The thing that we are trying to do at facebook, is just help people connect and communicate more efficiently.
 - It used to be the case, like you’d switch jobs, and then maybe you wouldn’t keep in touch with all the people that you knew from that old job, just because it was too hard. But one of the things that Facebook does is it makes it really easy to just stay in touch with all these people.
 - It’s not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.
 - Facebook is uniquely positioned to answer questions that people have, like, what sushi restaurants have my friends gone to in New York lately and liked? These are queries you could potentially do with Facebook that you couldn’t do with anything else, we just have to do it.
 - With some of the issues around the Snowden leaks and what the NSA was doing I think have scared people around the world and I think in many ways rightfully so.
 - Our goal is not to build a platform; it’s to be cross all of them.
 - In my experience everyone will have a different view of the right level of tax so governments need to provide clear guidance that conforms to a set of international standards that all governments accept.
 - Providing the best photo sharing experience is one reason why so many people love Facebook and we knew it would be worth bringing these two companies together.
 - You hear these stories about people who take apart their radio and put it back. Or just learn a lot from taking it apart. But I wasn’t as into that stuff as I was just into how computer programs work...

 - When you give everyone a voice and give people power, the system usually ends up in a really good place. So, what we view our role as, is giving people that power.

 - I think as a company, if you can get two things right – having a clear direction on what you are trying to do and bringing in great people who can execute on the stuff – then you can do pretty well.
 - If people want change, then they will find a way to get that change. So, whatever technology they may or may not have used was neither a necessary nor sufficient case for getting to the outcome that they got to, but having people who wanted change was.
 - In the olden times, privacy was good. Today people want to share, people are more open.

 - I think that more flow of information, the ability to stay connected to more people makes people more effective as people. And I mean, that’s true socially. It makes you have more fun, right. It feels better to be more connected to all these people. You have a richer life.

 - What Facebook stands for in the world is giving people a voice and spreading ideas and rationalism.

More than four million businesses have Pages on Facebook that they use to have a dialogue with their customers. We expect this trend to grow as well.
 - Almost any mistake you can make in running a company, I’ve probably made.
 - I actually do think you’re seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that’s a lot of why companies are starting blogs, are just giving more insight into what’s going on with them.

 - I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we’ve worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.
 - Of course, hate speech and racism have no place on Facebook.
 - If you think about companies that were built in Silicon Valley, a lot of them early on were chip companies. And now the companies that are there, like Apple, are much more successful than any of the chip companies were.

 - And connected is helping people stay in touch and maintain empathy for each other, and bandwidth.

 - Of course the Silicon Valley is unique and Berlin is not yet comparable. But of all the different cities that are building a startup infrastructure, Berlin is the one with the most similar energy.
 - People will always want more immersive ways to express themselves. So if you go back ten years ago on the internet, most of what people shared and consumed was text. Now a lot of it is photos. I think, going forward, a lot of it is going to be videos, getting richer and richer.
 - My goal was never to just create a company. A lot of people misinterpret that, as if I don’t care about revenue or profit or any of those things. But what not being just a company means to me is not being just that – building something that actually makes a really big change in the world.
