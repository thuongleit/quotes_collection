 - We cannot love a person with an all accepting, transcending and encompassing love without being hurt somewhat, without being disappointed, without being failed of our expectations. We cannot love without being broken, yet we cannot continue in love without being stronger than our brokenness.
 - It is our wounds that create in us a desire to reach for miracles. The fulfillment of such miracles depends on whether we let our wounds pull us down or lift us up towards our dreams.
 - We hurt so much because we have lost a part of ourselves. If we have loved much, we must have given much also, and when everythingâ€™s over, we feel as though we have lost everything.
