 - It’s only human to have low moments in life because if you don’t, then you won’t feel the high, exciting times.
 - Handicaps are mindsets. Whatever it is that stands in the way of achieving something, that’s when it’s a handicap. I prefer to see them as obstacles or challenges. This is how I’ve been my whole life. I don’t know any different. I just live my life through my feet.
