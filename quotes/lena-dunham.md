 - I remember asking my mom, “Do you think that I will ever have enough money to live outside of your house?” And she would be like, “You just never know.”

 - I’m not jealous in traditional ways – of boyfriends or babies or bank accounts – but I do covet other women’s styles of being.
 - I value my health and my happiness. And I’ve realized exercise can give me both of those things.

 - Part of being a feminist is giving other women the freedom to make choices you might not necessarily make yourself.
 - Feminists believe that men and women should have the same opportunities. If you are a feminist you believe in equal rights as a whole. That’s not a concept you can really shoot down.

 - When I was nine, I wrote a vow of celibacy on a piece of paper and ate it.
 - You have to move so you don’t die. You have to move so your brain doesn’t atrophy. You have to move so that you look a little bit like a person that you might want to be. There are a thousand reasons why exercise is important, and I’ve had to find ways to make it sexy for myself.

 - People are ultimately threatened by young people taking positions of power.
 - I consider being female such a unique gift, such a sacred joy, in ways that run so deep I can’t articulate them. It’s a special kind of privilege to be born into the body you wanted, to embrace the essence of your gender even as you recognize what you are up against. Even as you seek to redefine it.

 - I think about my best friendship – which the Marnie-Hannah friendship in Girls is based on – as like a great romance of my young life.
 - I should do the things that make me feel cool and smart. As I get older, I’m realizing more and more that it doesn’t really matter if I’m good at it, it just matters that I try. My own effort, my own willingness, are becoming what’s appealing to me.
 - I just don’t want to be around people who don’t hate everything in their life right now.
 - Once, my little sister was walking down the street in her thick black glasses, and a homeless man muttered, Talk nerdy to me.
 - I can’t imagine a passionate affair with a native man.
 - It’s very easy for me to say what success is. I think success is connecting with an audience who understands you and having a dialogue with them. I think success is continuing to push yourself forward creatively and not sort of becoming a caricature of yourself.
 - No one wants to see a tattoo on a stomach.
 - It’s interesting how we often can’t see the ways in which we are being strong – like, you can’t be aware of what you’re doing that’s tough and brave at the time that you’re doing it because if you knew that it was brave, then you’d be scared.
 - Things that feel super personal actually feel really universal. It’s sort of the more you really identify something specific within yourself, the more people connect to it because ultimately we are all connected in some way.

 - When I write I’m never really thinking about themes or the universal.

 - I think breakfast is the one meal when you don’t have to eat animal, maybe.
 - My shape reminds me a lot of my grandmother, whom I was really close to. She died when I was 13, and we have a really similar body type, the squat New England woman who can roll out dough and bring in your lawnmower. That’s kind of the vibe of my body, and I’m into it.
 - Running had always been off the table for me. It just looks embarrassing when I do it. I viewed it like learning a new language – best to learn it as a child.
 - I learned that people are much more game to mock their own personas than you would think.
 - I am comforted by the fact that I find a real range of female bodies beautiful, and I hope that other people do too. And even if they don’t find it beautiful I hope they’re just glad that something like it is happening on TV.
 - I didn’t drink in the essence of the classroom. I didn’t take legible notes or dance all night. I thought I would marry my boyfriend and grow old and sick of him. I thought I would keep my friends, and we’d make different, new memories. None of that happened. Better things happened.

 - You should always go where there is a ‘you-shaped’ hole in the world.

 - We both followed our hearts and had no choice but to hurt each other deeply.
 - Women saying “I’m not a feminist” is my greatest pet peeve. Do you believe that women should be paid the same for doing the same jobs? Do you believe that women should be allowed to leave the house? Do you think that women and men both deserve equal rights? Great, then you’re a feminist.
 - I feel like I don’t watch that many shows with death.
 - Confidence lets you pull anything off, even Tevas with socks.

 - I think romantic comedy, when done right, is my favorite genre. It’s just a genre that’s very human.
