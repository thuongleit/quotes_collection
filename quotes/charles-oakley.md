 - If it ain’t broke, don’t break it.
 - I’ve been patient with everything – management, coaches, players – but I want to play. I think I took my time eating my soup, the soup is gone. Now it’s time for the main course. The appetizers, throw them out the window.
 - I’m cool with whatever. I’ll just keep eating my bread, sipping my soup and serving my time. But the chicken is going to lay some more eggs one day.
