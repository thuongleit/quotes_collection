 - Our revenge is to live. We may be hunted like animals but we will not become animals. We have all chosen this â€“ to live free, like human beings, for as long as we can. Each day of freedom is a victory. And if we die trying to live, at least we die like human beings.
 - If we should die trying to live, at least we live like human beings.
