 - Throw your dreams into space like a kite, and you do not know what it will bring back, a new life, a new friend, a new love, a new country.
 - I don’t really want to become normal, average, standard. I want merely to gain in strength, in the courage to live out my life more fully, enjoy more, experience more. I want to develop even more original and more unconventional traits.
 - We travel, some of us forever, to seek other states, other lives, other souls.
 - Shame is the lie someone told you about yourself.
 - You don’t find love, it finds you. It’s got a little bit to do with destiny, fate, and what’s written in the stars.
 - Reality doesn’t impress me. I only believe in intoxication, in ecstasy, and when ordinary life shackles me, I escape, one way or another. No more walls.
 - Life is a process of becoming, a combination of states we have to go through. Where people fail is that they wish to elect a state and remain in it. This is a kind of death.
 - The secret of joy is the mastery of pain.
 - I, with a deeper instinct, choose a man who compels my strength, who makes enormous demands on me, who does not doubt my courage or my toughness, who does not believe me naïve or innocent, who has the courage to treat me like a woman.
 - We don't have a language for the senses. Feelings are images, sensations are like musical sounds.
 - The possession of knowledge does not kill the sense of wonder and mystery. There is always more mystery.
 - I take pleasure in my transformations. I look quiet and consistent, but few know how many women there are in me.

 - Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.
 - When your beauty struck me, it dissolved me. Deep down, I am not different from you. I dreamed you, I wished for your existence. I see in you that part of me which is you. I surrender my sincerity because if I love you it means we share the same fantasies, we share the same madness.
 - We do not escape into philosophy, psychology, and art – we go there to restore our shattered selves into whole ones.
 - In chaos, there is fertility.
 - You carry away with you a reflection of me, a part of me. I dreamed you; I wished for your existence. You will always be a part of my life. If I love you, it must be because we shared, at some moment, the same imaginings, the same madness, the same stage.
 - Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center. So we lost our center and have to find it again.
 - Dreams are necessary to life.
 - There are many ways to be free. One of them is to transcend reality by imagination, as I try to do.

 - The obstacle became his alibi for weakness.
 - I write emotional algebra.

 - There are very few human beings who receive the truth, complete and staggering, by instant illumination. Most of them acquire it fragment by fragment, on a small scale, by successive developments, cellularly, like a laborious mosaic.

 - If you can’t create, you destroy.
 - I love the abstract, delicate, profound, vague, voluptuously wordless sensation of living ecstatically.
 - Pain is something to master, not to wallow in.
 - Writers do not live one life, they live two. There is the living and then there is the writing. There is the second tasting, the delayed reaction.
 - When others asked the truth of me, I was convinced it was not the truth they wanted, but an illusion they could bear to live with.
 - Dreams pass into the reality of action. From the actions stems the dream again; and this interdependence produces the highest form of living.

 - I am aware of being in a beautiful prison, from which I can only escape by writing.
 - What is love but acceptance of the other, whatever he is.
 - Write. Write until it stops hurting.
 - I adore the struggle you carry in yourself. I adore your terrifying sincerity.
 - I postpone death by living, by suffering, by error, by risking, by giving, by losing.
 - I can’t let you go now. I want to go places with you; obscure little places, just to be able to say: here I came with her.
 - Something is always born of excess: great art was born of great terror, great loneliness, great inhibitions, instabilities, and it always balances them.

 - When one is pretending, the entire body revolts.
 - I believe one writes because one has to create a world in which one can live.
 - I either eat too much or starve myself. Sleep for 14 hours or have insomniac nights. Fall in love very hard or hate passionately. I don’t know what grey is. I never did.
 - Where the myth fails, human love begins. Then we love a human being, not our dream, but a human being with flaws.
 - I am only responsible for my own heart, you offered yours up for the smashing my darling. Only a fool would give out such a vital organ.
 - I made no resolutions for the New Year. The habit of making plans, of criticizing, sanctioning and molding my life, is too much of a daily event for me.
 - We are like sculptors, constantly carving out of others the image we long for, need, love or desire, often against reality, against their benefit, and always, in the end, a disappointment, because it does not fit them.
 - For you and for me the highest moment, the keenest joy, is not when our minds dominate but when we lose our minds, and you and I both lose it in the same way, through love.
 - Creation which cannot express itself becomes madness.

 - I will always be the virgin-prostitute, the perverse angel, the two-faced sinister and saintly woman.
 - I am like a snake who has already bitten. I retreat from a direct battle while knowing the slow effect of the poison.

 - This diary is my kief, hashish and opium pipe. This is my drug and my vice.

 - Introspection is a devouring monster. You have to feed it with much material, much experience, many people, many places, many loves, many creations, and then it ceases feeding on you.

 - Beware of allowing a tactless word, a rebuttal, a rejection to obliterate the whole sky.
 - If a person continues to see only giants, it means he is still seeing the world through the eyes of a child. I have a feeling that man’s fear of woman comes from having first seen her as the mother, creator of men.
 - I often see how you sob over what you destroy, how you want to stop and just worship; and you do stop, and then a moment later you are at it again with a knife, like a surgeon.
 - If what Proust says is true, that happiness is the absence of fever, then I will never know happiness. For I am possessed by a fever for knowledge, experience, and creation.

 - You have a right to experiment with your life. You will make mistakes. And they are right too.
 - Luxury is not a necessity to me, but beautiful and good things are.
 - I don’t hear your words: your voice reverberates against my body like another kind of caress, another kind of penetration. I have no power over your voice. It comes straight from you into me. I could stuff my ears and it would find its way into my blood and make it rise.

 - He does not need opium. He has the gift of reverie.
 - We see things the way we are, not the way they are.
 - Compassion for our parents is the true sign of maturity.
 - There were silences in my head. I could abandon myself completely to the pleasure of multiple relationships, to the beauty of the day, to the joys of the day. It was as if a cancer in me had ceased gnawing me. The cancer of introspection.
 - Mature people relate to each other without the need to merge.
 - I had been struck by the analogy between neurosis and romanticism. Romanticism was truly a parallel to neurosis. It demanded of reality an illusory world, love, an absolute which it could never obtain, and thus destroyed itself by the dream.

 - Life is truly known only to those who suffer, lose, endure adversity and stumble from defeat to defeat.

 - All those who try to unveil the mysteries always have tragic lives. At the end they are always punished.
 - My life is not possible to tell. I change every day, change my patterns, my concepts, my interpretations. I am a series of moods and sensations. I play a thousand roles. I weep when I find others play them for me. My real self is unknown. My work is merely an essence of this vast and deep adventure.

 - How well I know with what burning intensity you live. You have experienced many lives already, including several you have shared with me- full rich lives from birth to death, and you just have to have these rest periods in between.
 - All of my creation is an effort to weave a web of connection with the world: I am always weaving it because it was once broken.
 - It is difficult to live with the pure. They do not condemn you; they forgive you. This forgiveness is more terrible than a judgment.
 - The secret of life was Breath. That was what I always wanted my words to do, to Breathe.

 - The only transformer and alchemist that turns everything into gold is love. The only magic against death, aging, ordinary life, is love.
 - We are all engaged in the task of peeling off the false selves, the programmed selves, the selves created by our families, our culture, our religions. It is an enormous task because the history of women has been as incompletely told as the history of blacks.
 - Whenever you do something that is not aligned with the yearning or your soul – you create suffering.
 - I had a feeling that Pandora’s box contained the mysteries of woman’s sensuality, so different from a man’s and for which man’s language was so inadequate. The language of sex had yet to be invented. The language of the senses was yet to be explored.

 - Death from disillusion is not instantaneous, and there are no mercy killers for the disillusioned.
 - I am an excitable person who only understands life lyrically, musically, in whom feelings are much stronger as reason.
 - Travel is seeking the lost paradise. It is the supreme illusion of love.
 - I have a prejudice against people with money. I have known so many, and none have escaped the corruption of power. In this I am a purist. I love people motivated by love and not by power. If you have money and power, and are motivated by love, you give it all away.
 - I love man as creator, lover, husband, friend, but man the father I do not trust. I do not believe in man as father. I do not trust man as father.
 - I don’t mind working, holding my ground intellectually, artistically; but as a woman, oh, God, as a woman I want to be dominated.
 - A leaf fluttered in through the window this morning, as if supported by the rays of the sun, a bird settled on the fire escape, joy in the task of coffee, joy accompanied me as I walked.
 - What a mystery this is, desire. The love sickness, the sensitivity, the obsession, the flutter of the heart, the ebb and flow of the blood. There is no drug and no alcohol to equal it.
 - Writing more and more to the sound of music, writing more and more like music. Sitting in my studio tonight, playing record after record, writing, music a stimulant of the highest order, far more potent than wine.

 - I spell ‘god’ with a small ‘g’ because I do not believe in him, but I love to swear by him.
 - Warmth, perfume, rugs, soft lights, books. They do not appease me. I am aware of time passing, of all the world contains that I have not seen, of all the interesting people I have not met.
 - She makes use of the soft of the bread for a napkin. She falls asleep at times with shoes on, on unmade beds. When a little money comes in, June buys delicacies, strawberries in the winter, caviar and bath salts.
 - I want to love you wildly. I don’t want words, but inarticulate cries, meaningless, from the bottom of my most primitive being, that flow from my belly like honey. A piercing joy, that leaves me empty, conquered, silenced.

 - Tranquillity is contagious, peace is contagious. One only thinks of the contagiousness of illness, but there is the contagion of serenity and joy.
 - All that is sacred and taboo in the world are meaningless.
 - Idealism is the death of the body and the imagination. All but freedom, utter freedom, is death.
 - I believe that in judging our actions we are more severe than professional judges. We judge not only our actions, but our thoughts, our intentions, our secret curses, our hidden hate.
 - I hate rarely, though when I hate, I hate murderously.
 - Our love lives because I live.
 - I walk ahead of myself in perpetual expectancy of miracles.
 - The real wonders of life lie in the depths. Exploring the depths for truths is the real wonder which the child and the artist know: magic and power lie in truth.
 - I have an attitude now that is immovable. I shall remain outside of the world, beyond the temporal, beyond all the organizations of the world. I only believe in poetry.

 - To love and to labor is the sum of living.
 - I want to live darkly and richly in my femaleness.

 - The human father has to be confronted and recognized as human, as man who created a child and then, by his absence, left the child fatherless and then Godless.
 - I gathered poets around me and we all wrote beautiful erotica. As we were condemned to focus only on sensuality, we had violent explosions of poetry. Writing erotica became a road to sainthood rather than to debauchery.
 - One handles truths like dynamite. Literature is one vast hypocrisy, a giant deception, treachery. All writers have concealed more than they revealed.
 - We three belong to the Middle Ages. We have this need of heroism, and there is no place for such feelings in modern life. That is our tragedy. Once I wanted to be a saint. It seemed the only absolute act left to do, for what is most powerful in me is the craving for purity, greatness.

 - To write at the same temperature at which I live I should write nothing but poetry.

 - I believe the lasting revolution comes from deep changes in ourselves which influence our collective life.
 - The fiery moments of passionate experience are the moments of wholeness and totality of the personality.
 - We are cruel when someone refuses to play the role in which we have cast him. We judge a person only according to his relationship towards us.

 - Strange, isn’t it, that no chemical will give a human being the iridescence that illusions have given them? Give me your hat.

 - I never liked the language of Henry Miller. I don’t think pornography has added to our sensual life.
 - The important task of literature is to free man, not to censor him, and that is why Puritanism was the most destructive and evil force which ever oppressed people and their literature: it created hypocrisy, perversion, fears, sterility.

 - The basis of insincerity is the idealized image we hold of ourselves and wish to impose on others.

 - Your strength is soft, indirect, delicate, tender, womanly. But it is strength just the same.
 - We did not touch each other. We were both leaning over the abyss.
 - Physical experiences, lacking the joys of love, depend on twists and perversions of pleasure. Abnormal pleasures kill the taste for normal ones.

 - A war regarded as inevitable or even probable, and therefore much prepared for, has a very good chance of eventually being fought.
 - I cheat him, I deceive him, yet the world does not sink in sulphur-colored mists. Madness conquers. I can no longer put my mosaics together. I just cry and laugh.
 - But I lie. I embellish. My words are not deep enough. They disguise, they conceal. I will not rest until I have told of my descent into a sensuality which was as dark, as magnificent, as wild, as my moments of mystic creation have been dazzling, ecstatic, exalted.

 - Violence is a symptom of impotence.
 - Everything but happiness is neurosis.
 - I see myself wrapped in lies, which do not seem to penetrate my soul, as if they are not really a part of me. They are like costumes.
