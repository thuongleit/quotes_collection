 - Architecture is not about form.
 - I think space, architectural space, is my thing. It’s not about facade, elevation, making image, making money. My passion is creating space.
 - Architecture is exposed to life. If its body is sensitive enough, it can assume a quality that bears witness to past life.
 - When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It’s not about paper, it’s not about forms. It’s about space and material.
 - Normally, architects render a service. They implement what other people want. This is not what I do. I like to develop the use of the building together with the client, in a process, so that as we go along we become more intelligent.
 - When I concentrate on a specific site or place for which I am going to design a building, I try to plumb its depths, its form, its history and its sensuous qualities.

 - My buildings should have an emotional core –a space which, in itself, has an emotional nice feeling.
 - I need a close contact to the client, whoever it is, and a commitment of the client to go out and do a process together. I want to do the best for him. I need his respect and his patience. I want to work with a sophisticated person who’s interested in a good building and not in my name.

 - There is still a real need for good quality architecture, not paper architecture, but the real stuff.
