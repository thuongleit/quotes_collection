 - The only thing you fear is the unreality that you yourself have invented.

 - Insanity is arguing with reality.
 - I discovered that when I believed my thoughts, I suffered, but that when I didn’t believe them, I didn’t suffer, and that this is true for every human being. Freedom is as simple as that.

 - I stopped waiting for the world to give me what I wanted; I started giving it to myself.

 - If you knew how important you are, you would fragment into a billion pieces and just be light.

 - You’re never given more pain than you can handle. You never, ever get more than you can take.
 - No one can hurt me – that’s my job.
 - The mind usually says, “I know, I know, I know.” But the “don’t-know mind” is where wisdom lives.

 - It’s good that it hurts. Pain is the signal that you’re confused, that you’re in a lie.
 - There is no security for those who seek it outside of themselves.

 - The world is nothing but my perception of it. I see only through myself. I hear only through the filter of my story.
 - The ability to understand the cause of your own suffering gives you the ability to understand ours.
 - Everyone wants peace, inside and outside, and we would all have it if we knew how. Now we know how. It begins with you.
 - Any story that you tell about yourself causes suffering. There is no authentic story.

 - We fear only what we haven’t understood.
 - Your most intimate relationship is the one you have with your thoughts.

 - Seeking love keeps you from the awareness that you already have it – that you are it.
 - No-one can disappoint you, only your thoughts about them can.

 - Nothing terrible has ever happened except in our thinking. Reality is always good, even in situations that seem like nightmares. The story we tell is the only nightmare that we have lived.
 - When we question our thoughts, we see that the craziness was never in the world, but in us.
 - After you’ve been doing inquiry for a while, if you have the thought “She doesn’t love me,” you just get the immediate turnaround with a smile: “Oh, I’m not loving myself in this moment.”
 - Thoughts are just what is. They appear. They’re innocent. They’re not personal.
 - I am entirely motivated without anger. The truth sets us free, and freedom acts.
 - There’s no nightmare you can’t wake yourself up from.
 - Each time your mind changes your whole world is changed.

 - The world will be at war as long as the mind is at war with itself. If we can’t find peace within ourselves, where is the hope for peace in the world?
 - When they attack you and you notice that you love them with all your heart, your Work is done.
 - For me, if somebody tells me to go away, that is an opportunity: for me to give the person a better life, to realize where not to be, and to see what could be even better than being with that person I love.
 - How do you react when you think you need people’s love? Do you become a slave for their approval?
 - That’s where the fear comes from-from your uninvestigated thoughts.
 - I have never experienced a stressful feeling that wasn’t caused by attaching to an untrue thought. Behind every uncomfortable feeling, there’s a thought that isn’t true for us.
 - I’ll tell you that for me, one when someone used to say something that was true, one way I knew it was true was that I immediately felt defensive. I blocked it off, and I went to war with them in my mind and suffered all that goes with it. And they were only saying what was true.

 - It’s not the problem that causes our suffering; it’s our thinking about the problem.
 - Realizing that people should lie when they do makes me a little more open-minded, a little more tolerant, when my child or my partner lies.
 - When you do The Work, you see who you are by seeing who you think other people are. Eventually you come to see that everything outside you is a reflection of your own thinking. You are the storyteller, the projector of all stories, and the world is the projected image of your thoughts.
 - You are your only hope, because we’re not changing until you do. Our job is to keep coming at you, as hard as we can, with everything that angers, upsets, or repulses you, until you understand. We love you that much, whether we’re aware of it or not. The whole world is about you.

 - There is no peace in the world until you find peace within yourself in this moment.
 - Until you can see everything in the world as your friend, your work is not done.
 - Judge your neighbor, write it down. Ask four questions, turn it around.
 - It makes sense that no one else can cause you pain. That’s your job.
 - Happiness is a clear mind. A clear and sane mind knows how to live, how to work, what emails to send, what phone calls to make, and what to do do to create what it wants without fear.
 - My experience is that the teachers we need most are the people we’re living with right now.

 - When a thought hurts, that’s the signal that it isn’t true.
 - The pain shows you what’s left to investigate.
 - The most important relationship is the mind’s relationship with itself. In other words, the ultimate – and, really, the only – relationship you have is the relationship with your own thoughts.

 - If you want a little fear and terror because your life is dull, get a future. Terrifying!
 - I love what I think, and I’m never tempted to believe it. Thoughts are like the wind or the leaves on the trees or the raindrops falling. They’re not personal, they don’t belong to us, they just come and go. When they’re met with understanding, they’re friends.
 - The ego is terrified of the truth. And the truth is that the ego doesn’t exist.
 - Pay close attention to the particular thoughts you use to deprive yourself of happiness.
 - I havent had a single thought for 26 years. I have only understanding. Its somewhat complicated to understand that. Ive hardly ever spoken about it. Youre in a state of total peace of mind. A kind of nirvana.

 - Any thought of discomfort or stress is an alarm that lets you know you’re believing an untrue thought.
 - You can only see what you believe – nothing else is possible.
 - It’s not the darkness that people fear; it’s what they imagine into the darkness.

 - All sadness is a tantrum.

 - Don’t believe every thing you think.
 - If you’re yelling within you that they shouldn’t yell at you, that is where the pain begins, not with their yelling at you.
 - The whole planet is waiting for someone to do it first.
 - It’s a wonderful world when you have what you want at all times.
 - And as long as we believe what we believe-until that is questioned-there’s no progress as a human race. Again, we still have war. So, effective rehabilitation is to question what we believe. When that happens, everyone gets out of prison.
 - You can never make yourself believe that you’re loveable, however hard you try, because when the chips are down what you really believe rises to the surface of the mind to replace what you want to believe.
 - All I have is all I need and all I need is all I have in this moment.
 - It’s not easy to find your own way when you believe that you need love, approval, appreciation, or anything from your family. It’s particularly hard when you want them to see things your way.
 - How do I know it was meant to happen this way? Because it did.
 - Do you want to be right more than you want to know the truth? It’s the truth that set me free. Acceptance, peace, and less attachment to a world of suffering are all effects of doing The Work. They’re not the goals. Do The Work for the love of freedom, for the love of truth.
 - When we stop opposing reality, action becomes simple, fluid, kind, and fearless.
 - I don’t let go of concepts -I meet them with understanding. Then they let go of me.
 - The best way of leading people is to let them find their own way.
 - We don’t attach to people or to things; we attach to uninvestigated concepts that we believe to tbe true in the moment.
 - When we believe in our thoughts, when we tell ourselves a story, we suffer. ‘My husband doesn’t respect me.’ ‘I should be thinner.’ Those are stories. When there’s no story, there’s no suffering.

 - We do not mature through age. We mature in awareness.
 - Maybe everything we’ve ever done has been for love.
 - There’s no one who can teach you except yourself. Each of us needs to look at what our belief system really consists of. Look at the concepts that come across your mind and just notice what you believe.
 - The world is as you perceive it to be. For me, clarity is a word for beauty. It’s what I am. And when I’m clear, I see only beauty. Nothing else is possible.
 - Some children are afraid to die because their parents are afraid to die. My own children have come to understand that it’s totally okay with me if they die. They don’t have to live for my sake.
 - Would you rather be right or free?
 - What we really believe is what we manifest. What we believe, we see.
 - I used to sleep on the floor next to the bed, because I believed that I didn’t even deserve a bed to sleep in. And then, one morning, a cockroach crawled onto my leg. I looked at it, and suddenly I awoke from a kind of hypnotic trance in which I had been all my life.

 - You cannot hurt me. Only I can do that.
 - You don’t experience anxiety unless you’re attached to a thought that isn’t true for you. It’s that simple.
 - Who would you be without the thought “I need more money to be safe?” You might be a lot easier to be with. You might even begin to notice the laws of generosity, the laws of letting money go out fearlessly and come back fearlessly. You don’t ever need more money than you have.
 - My mother became a believer, and then I became a believer. But when I was 43 years old, I began to think for myself, somehow, by fluke and by grace. And I thought, “Oh, my. I was so mistaken.” The world isn’t what I believed it to be. I am not what I believed me to be, and neither is anyone.
 - The world you live in is 100 percent your own responsibility. If you don’t like your world, it doesn’t work to say, “Well, it’s my mother’s fault. She taught me how to think.”
 - That’s the purpose of stress. It’s a friend. It’s an alarm clock, built in to let you know that it’s time to do The Work.
 - But when you think you’re supposed to do something with it and imagine that you’re the doer, that’s pure delusion. Just follow your passion. Do what you love. Inquire, and have a happy life while you’re doing it.

 - Until you look forward to all criticism, your Work’s not done.

 - Identify your painful thought, question it, and wake yourself up. No one else can.
 - You can’t have an up without a down. You can’t have a left without a right. This is duality. If you have a problem, you must already have the solution. The question is, do you really want the solution, or do you want to perpetuate the problem?
 - That’s what I love about integrity. Each time we go inside, that’s where it is.

 - No one can give you freedom but you.
 - If we are in silence – in absolute silence with no thoughts – for 10 minutes, it’s only a thought that tells us we were silent for 10 minutes. Our only proof is a thought.

 - You don’t have to feel bad to act kindly. Love doesn’t stand by, it moves with the speed of clarity.
 - To exclude anything that appears in your universe is not love. Love joins with everything. It doesn’t exclude the monster. It doesn’t avoid the nightmare – it looks forward to it.
 - I’ve heard people say that they cling to their painful thoughts because they’re afraid that without them they wouldn’t be activists for peace. “If I feel peaceful,” they say, “why would I bother taking action at all?”
 - Here’s how a child listens: you tell him something, and he puts his own interpretation on what you said. That’s what he hears. No one has ever heard you.
 - Any stressful thought that you have about the planet, for example, shows you where you are stuck, where your energy is being exhausted in not fully meeting life as it is, without condition.
 - Your suffering is never caused by the person you’re blaming.
 - Nothing comes ahead of its time, and nothing ever happened that didn’t need to happen.
