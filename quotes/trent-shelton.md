 - Broken crayons still colour the same
 - It takes all kinds to make a world go round.
 - Just because they say they’re praying for you in your face, doesn’t mean they aren’t laughing at your struggle behind your back.
 - Don’t let anyone drain you of your happiness today. Be drama free. Rise above the petty stuff.
 - Never make excuses for someone who disrespects you-who they are or what they do isn’t a pass to treat you like trash!
 - Don’t stay stuck on the people who’ve hurt you. Move on and let your future give you the better that you deserve.
 - Stop trying to change someone who does not want to change. Stop giving chances to someone who abuses your forgiveness. Stop walking back to the place where your heart ran from. Stop trusting their words and ignoring their actions. Stop breaking your own heart.
 - You can’t be everything to everybody, but you can be everything to somebody. Don’t lose the ones you love trying to please the world.
 - Don’t pursue a heart that you’re not ready to be loyal to.
 - You never have to question something that’s real...
