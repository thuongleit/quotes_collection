 - Never let an earthly circumstance disable you spiritually.
 - Once any of us conclude- ‘That’s just the way I am,’ we give up our ability to change.
 - And without delay, turn to the Lord. Exercise all of the faith you have in Him. Let Him share your burden. Allow His grace to lighten your load.
 - Who we are is not who we can become.
