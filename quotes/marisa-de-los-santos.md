 - I can’t stand lies. Probably no one can. Probably everyone is, to varying degrees, allergic to them, both spiritually and physically. Lies make me feel low and ignoble, and also itchy, like there’s sand under my skin. The only thing that feels worse than hearing a lie is telling one.
 - No one is ever quite ready; everyone is always caught off guard. Parenthood chooses you. And you open your eyes, look at what you’ve got, say “Oh, my gosh,” and recognize that of all the balls there ever were, this is the one you should not drop. It’s not a question of choice.
 - But some things, no matter how unlikely, are just supposed to happen. You know what I mean. Some things just smack of the future and feel part of an overarching rightness.
 - We talked and talked and talked. Maybe love comes in at the eyes, but not nearly as much as it comes in at the ears, at least in my experience. As we talked, lights flicked on inside my head; by the end of the night I was a planterium.
 - Even if someone wasn’t perfect or even especially good, you couldn’t dismiss the love they felt. Love was always love; it had a rightness all its own, even if the person feeling the love was full of wrongness.
 - There’s a kind of holiness to love, requited or not, and those people who don’t receive it with gratitude are arrogant beyond saving.
 - People in love feel that way all the time, like they don’t know what they’ve done to deserve each other.
 - I don’t think love is blind, but wanting to be in love, that’s probably blind.
 - I spoke, I listened, and my heart broke, which is to say that it didn’t break at all but became suddenly aware of its own wholeness in such a way it hurt like hell.
