 - Well-behaved women seldom make history.
 - A pioneer is not someone who makes her own soap. She is one who takes up her burdens and walks toward the future.
 - History is a conversation and sometimes a shouting match between present and past, though often the voices we most want to hear are barely audible.
 - Some history-making is intentional; much of it is accidental.
 - An androgynous mind was not a male mind. It was a mind attuned to the full range of human experience, including the invisible lives of women.
