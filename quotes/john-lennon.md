 - I felt an obligation even then to write a song that people would sing in the pub or on a demonstration. That is why I would like to compose songs for the revolution.

 - I believe Jesus was right, Buddha was right, and all of those people like that are right. They’re all saying the same thing -? and I believe it. I believe what Jesus actually said -? the basic things he laid down about love and goodness -? and not what people say he said.

 - I’ve never really been wanted.
 - As someone from the working class I was always interested in Russia and China and everything that related to the working class, even though I was playing the capitalist game.
 - As a child I did a lot of imaginary bits, you know. It depends on the individual, I enjoyed then knocking the nail in, I enjoy knocking nails in walls to hang pictures up, but I also enjoy thinking ‘I’m gonna do that’ but I actually won’t do it, I enjoy imagining doing things just as much.

 - You don’t have to be some sort of freak to meditate.

 - People think the Beatles know what’s going on. We don’t. We’re just doing it.
 - I feel now at 53 I have grown into a deeper understanding of what a human life is.
 - My defenses were so great. The cocky rock and roll hero who knows all the answers was actually a terrified guy who didn’t know how to cry. Simple.

 - Everything is true and not true about everything. That’s one thing I’ve learned.

 - Love, Love, Love. All you need is love. Love is all you need.

 - I didn’t come after Elvis and Dylan, I’ve been around always. But if I see or meet a great artist, I love ’em.

 - If we took over Britain, then we’d have the job of cleaning up the bourgeoisie and keeping people in a revolutionary state of mind.
 - I’d always felt repressed. We were all so pressurised that there was hardly any chance of expressing ourselves, especially working at that rate, touring continually and always kept in a cocoon of myths and dreams.
 - I’m always proud and pleased when people do my songs. It gives me pleasure that they even attempt them, because a lot of my songs aren’t that doable.
 - It’s just natural, it’s not a great disaster. People keep talking about it like it’s The End of The Earth. It’s only a rock group that split up, it’s nothing important. You know, you have all the old records there if you want to reminisce.

 - Everything I’ve ever done is out. I don’t have boxes of unreleased stuff. There’s nothing in the files. I can never keep anything unless I don’t like the sound of it or it didn’t work. If I can sing it to an engineer, I can sing it to anyone...

 - Somehow the revolutionaries must approach the workers because the workers won’t approach them. But it’s difficult to know where to start; we’ve all got a finger in the dam. The problem for me is that as I have become more real, I’ve grown away from most working-class people.
 - The greatest artists always come round to simplicity.
 - I put things down on sheets of paper and stuff them in my pockets. When I have enough, I have a book.

 - In the two books I wrote, even though they were written in a sort of Joycean gobbledegook, there’s many knocks at religion and there is a play about a worker and a capitalist. I’ve been satirising the system since my childhood. I used to write magazines in school and hand them around.

 - Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come.
 - I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever done. I think it’s realistic, and it’s true to the me that has been developing over the years. I like first-person music.
