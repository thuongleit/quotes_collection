 - Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply.

 - Trust is the glue of life. It’s the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It’s the foundational principle that holds all relationships.
 - Proactive people carry their own weather with them.
 - Motivation is a fire from within. If someone else tries to light that fire under you, chances are it will burn very briefly.
 - Synergy is better than my way or your way. It’s our way.
 - To begin with the end in mind means to start with a clear understanding of your destination. It means to know where you’re going so that you better understand where you are now and so that the steps you take are always in the right direction.
 - The way we see the problem is the problem.
 - Strength lies in differences, not in similarities.
 - Stop setting goals. Goals are pure fantasy unless you have a specific plan to achieve them.

 - Leadership is a choice, not a position.
 - Taking initiative is a form of self-empowerment.
 - Live your life by a compass, not a clock.
 - We see the world, not as it is, but as we are – or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our mouths to describe what we see, we in effect describe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms.
 - To live; to love; to learn; and to leave a legacy.
 - What you do has far greater impact than what you say.
 - Self-awareness involves deep personal honesty. It comes from asking and answering hard questions.
 - When you have too many top priorities, you effectively have no top priorities.
 - One thing’s for sure. If we keep doing what we’re doing, we’re going to keep getting what we’re getting. One definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing and expect different results.
 - People don’t listen to understand. They listen to reply. The collective monologue is everyone talking and no one listening.
 - The undisciplined are slaves to moods, appetites and passions.

 - The essence of synergy is to value differences-to respect them, to build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses.

 - You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut.
 - You can learn great things from your mistakes when you aren’t busy denying them.
 - Where you are headed is more important than how fast you are going. Rather than always focusing on what’s urgent, learn to focus on what is really important.
 - Difference is the beginning of synergy.
 - Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should be and he will become as he can and should be.
 - Happiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice.
 - Be patient with yourself. Self-growth is tender; it’s holy ground. There’s no greater investment.
 - It takes humility to seek feedback. It takes wisdom to understand it, analyze it and appropriately act on it.
 - Beginners are many; finishers are few.

 - We judge ourselves by our intentions. And others by their actions.
 - Interdependent people combine their own efforts with the efforts of others to achieve their greatest success.
 - We can act instead of being acted upon.
 - Trust is the highest form of human motivation. It brings out the very best in people. But it takes time and patience.
 - Free your heart from hatred – forgive. Free your mind from worries – most never happen. Live simply and appreciate what you have. Give more. Expect less.
 - Paradigms are powerful because they create the lens through which we see the world.
 - If the big rocks don’t go in first, they aren’t going to fit in later.
 - The only thing that endures over time is the ‘Law of the Farm.’ You must prepare the ground, plant the seed, cultivate, and water if you expect to reap the harvest.

 - If the ladder is not leaning against the right wall, every step we take just gets us to the wrong place faster.
 - Life is a mission, not a career.
 - Self-awareness is our capacity to stand apart from ourselves and examine our thinking, our motives, our history, our scripts, our actions, and our habits and tendencies.
 - To touch the soul of another human being is to walk on holy ground.
 - We think we see the world as it is, when in fact we see the world as we are.
 - You can’t hold someone accountable for results if you supervise their methods.
 - Almost every significant breakthrough is the result of a courageous break with traditional ways of thinking.
 - The amateur salesman sells products; the professional sells solutions to needs and problems.
 - Once you have a clear picture of your priorities – that is values, goals, and high leverage activities – organize around them.
 - Nothing tastes as good as thin feels.
 - Compliance does not foster innovation, trust does. You can’t sustain long-term innovation, for example, in a climate of distrust.
 - The reality is that everybody makes mistakes. The issue isn’t whether you will make them, it’s what you will do about them. It’s whether you will choose the path of humility and courage or the path of ego and pride.
 - Most people struggle with life balance simply because they haven’t paid the price to decide what is really important to them.
 - Satisfied needs do not motivate. It’s only the unsatisfied need that motivates. Next to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival – to be understood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated.
 - We must never be too busy to take time to sharpen the saw.
 - When you show deep empathy toward others, their defensive energy goes down, and positive energy replaces it. That’s when you can get more creative in solving problems.
 - Our ultimate freedom is the right and power to decide how anybody or anything outside ourselves will affect us.
 - Without involvement, there is no commitment. Mark it down, asterisk it, circle it, underline it. No involvement, no commitment.
 - Visualising something organises one’s ability to accomplish it.
 - If you can hire people whose passion intersects with the job, they won’t require any supervision at all. They will manage themselves better than anyone could ever manage them. Their fire comes from within, not from without. Their motivation is internal, not external.
 - Everyone chooses one of two roads in life – the old and the young, the rich and the poor, men and women alike. One is the broad, well-traveled road to mediocrity, the other road to greatness and meaning.
 - Moving along the upward spiral requires us to learn, commit, and do on increasingly higher planes. We deceive ourselves if we think that any one of these is sufficient. To keep progressing, we must learn, commit, and do-learn, commit, and do-and learn, commit, and do again.
 - Humility is the mother of all virtues, courage the father, integrity the child and wisdom the grandchild.
 - When you engage in a work that taps your talent and fuels your passion-that rises out of a great need in the world that you feel drawn by conscience to meet-therein lies your voice, your calling, your soul’s code.

 - We not not our feelings. We are not our moods. We not even our thoughts.

 - Being is seeing in the human dimension.
 - The key to success is dedication to life-long learning.

 - Organize and execute around priorities.
 - Time management is a misnomer, the challenge is to manage ourselves.
 - I teach people how to treat me by what I will allow.

 - Your power to choose your direction of your life allows you to reinvent yourself, to change your future, and to powerfully influence the rest of creation.
 - Network marketing has come of age. It’s undeniable that it has become a way to entrepreneurship and independence for millions of people.
 - Effective leadership is putting first things first. Effective management is discipline, carrying it out.
 - A personal mission statement becomes the DNA for every other decision we make.
 - Nothing is as fast as the speed of trust. Nothing is as fulfilling as a relationship of trust. Nothing is as inspiring as an offering of trust. Nothing is as profitable as the economics of trust. Nothing has more influence than a reputation of trust.
 - Trust is a function of two things: character and competence. Character includes your integrity, your motive and your intent with people. Competence includes your capabilities, your skills, and your track record. Both are vital.
 - What is common sense isn’t common practice.
 - The proactive approach to a mistake is to acknowledge it instantly, correct and learn from it. This literally turns a failure into a success.
 - When you really listen to another person from their point of view, and reflect back to them that understanding, it’s like giving them emotional oxygen.
 - Your most important work is always ahead of you, never behind you.
 - Efficient management without effective leadership is, as one individual phrased, it, “like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic”.
 - If you don’t have confidence in the diagnosis, you won’t have confidence in the prescription.
 - The greatest and most inspiring mountain climbing achievements in history are not so much stories of individual achievement, but are stories of the extraordinary power of a unified, talented, prepared team that stays loyally committed to one another and to their shared vision to the end.

 - An empowered organization is one in which individuals have the knowledge, skill, desire, and opportunity to personally succeed in a way that leads to collective organizational success.

 - Synergy: The combined effect of individuals in collaboration that exceeds the sum of their individual effects.

 - Live simply and appreciate what you have. Give more. Expect less.
 - Integrity in the Moment of Choice Quality of life depends on what happens in the space between stimulus and response.
 - Human beings are not things needing to be motivated and controlled; they are four dimensional – body, mind, heart, and spirit.
 - I am fortunate to have a very helpful team that enables me to spend time doing things that are important but not necessarily urgent. People who have no such team need to also make these larger decisions so that they can cheerfully say No to that which is urgent but not important.
 - Be proactive. Ask yourself, “Are my actions based on self-chosen values or on my moods, feelings and circumstances?”
 - The place to begin building any relationship is inside ourselves, inside our circle of influence, our own character.
 - There are certain things that are fundamental to human fulfillment. The essence of these needs is captured in the phrase ‘to live, to love, to learn, to leave a legacy.’ The need to leave a legacy is our spiritual need to have a sense of meaning, purpose, personal congruence, and contribution.
 - It doesn’t really matter how fast you’re going if you’re heading in the wrong direction.
 - True leadership is moral authority, not formal authority. Leadership is a choice, not a position. The choice is to follow universal timeless principles, which will build trust and respect from the entire organization. Those with formal authority alone will lose this trust and respect.
 - Results matter! They matter to your credibility.
 - People are your most valuable asset. Only people can be made to appreciate in value.

 - As long as you think the problem is out there, that very thought is the problem.
 - Do what is important, not what is urgent.
 - If you’re proactive, you don’t have to wait for circumstances or other people to create perspective expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own.

 - Happen to things, don’t let things happen to you.
 - When we listen with the intent to understand others, rather than with the intent to reply, we begin true communication and relationship building. Opportunities to then speak openly and to be understood come much more naturally and easily.
 - Belief is another word for paradigm. It’s a synonymous. Your belief of the way things are. Values are the way things should be, it’s a paradigm of the way things should be. Beliefs are the paradigms of the way things are.

 - Effective communication is built on the cement of trust. And trust is based on trustworthiness, not politics.
 - You can’t have the fruits without the roots.
 - The greatest thing you can do for your children is love your spouse.

 - Before you wonder “Am I doing things right?” wonder “Am I doing the right things?”
 - A good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it’s personal, it’s positive, it’s present tense, it’s visual, and it’s emotional.
 - Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They’re either speaking or preparing to speak. They’re filtering everything through their own paradigms, reading their autobiography into other people’s lives.
 - It’s incredibly easy to get caught up in an activity trap, in the busy-ness of life, to work harder and harder at climbing the ladder of success only to discover it’s leaning against the wrong wall. It is possible to be busy – very busy – without being very effective.
 - If I were to summarize in one sentence the single most important principle I have learned in the field of interpersonal relations, it would be this: Seek first to understand, then to be understood. This principle is the key to effective interpersonal communication.

 - Life is not accumulation, it is about contribution.
 - Management works in the system; leadership works on the system.
 - Success is when you realize obstacles you face are challenges to help you become better – and your response equals the challenge.
 - Perhaps the most important vision of all is develop a sense of self, a sense of your own destiny, a sense of unique mission and role in life.
 - Private Victory precedes Public Victory. Algebra comes before calculus.
 - I am personally convinced that one person can be a change catalyst, a ‘transformer’ in any situation, any organization. Such an individual is yeast that can leaven an entire loaf. It requires vision, initiative, patience, respect, persistence, courage, and faith to be a transforming leader.
 - If you carefully consider what you want to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find your definition of success.
 - If you put good people in bad systems you get bad results. You have to water the flowers you want to grow.
 - True greatness will be achieved through the abundant mind that works selflessly – with mutual respect, for mutual benefit.
 - Feedback often tells you more about the person who is giving it than about you.
 - The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person. Reactive people are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by their environment. Proactive people are driven by values – carefully thought about, selected and internalized values.
 - True independence of character empowers us to act rather than be acted upon.
 - The challenge is not to manage time, but to manage ourselves.
 - Building and repairing relationships are long-term investments.
 - Our greatest joy and our greatest pain comes in our relationships with others.
 - Leaders are not born or made – they are self made.
 - Trust is the glue that holds everything together. It creates the environment in which all of the other elements win-win stewardship agreements, self-directing individuals and teams, aligned structures and systems, and accountability can flourish.
 - Anything less then a conscious commitment to the important is an unconscious commitment to the unimportant.
 - The process of building trust is an interesting one, but it begins with yourself, with what I call self trust, and with your own credibility, your own trustworthiness. If you think about it, it’s hard to establish trust with others if you can’t trust yourself.
 - This is the single most powerful investment we can ever make in life – investment in ourselves, in the only instrument we have with which to deal with life and to contribute.
 - The key to growth is to learn to make promises and to keep them.
 - Remember, technology is a great servant, but a terrible master.
 - As human beings, we are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions. We can subordinate feelings to values.
 - Trust is the one thing that affects everything else you’re doing. It’s a performance multiplier which takes your trajectory upwards, for every activity you engage in, from strategy to execution.
 - I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my memory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past.
 - Effective interdependence can only be built on true independence.
 - Most people say their main fault is a lack of discipline. On deeper thought, I believe this is not the case. The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and minds.
 - The deepest desire of the human spirit is to be acknowledged.
 - When we succumb to believing that we are victims of our circumstances and yield to the plight of determinism, we lose hope, we lose drive, and we settle into resignation and stagnation.
 - Will we act upon life, or will we merely be acted upon?
 - How different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and keeping that picture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most.
 - If you want the secondary greatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character.
 - Consequences are governed by principles, and behavior is governed by values; therefore, value principles!

 - The challenge of work-life balance is without question one of the most significant struggles faced by modern man.

 - Our behavior is a function of our decisions, not our conditions.
 - Priority is a function of context.
 - Doing more things faster is no substitute for doing the right things.
 - Independent thinking alone is not suited to interdependent reality.
 - Instead, I have an abundance mentality: When people are genuinely happy at the successes of others, the pie gets larger.
 - The more people rationalize cheating, the more it becomes a culture of dishonesty. And that can become a vicious, downward cycle. Because suddenly, if everyone else is cheating, you feel a need to cheat, too.
 - Nothing is more exciting and bonding in relationships than creating together.
 - You don’t see the world as it is, you see it according to who you are.
 - Most leaders would agree that they’d be better off having an average strategy with superb execution than a superb strategy with poor execution. Those who execute always have the upper hand.
 - Love is a verb. Love – the feeling – is the fruit of love the verb or our loving actions. So love her. Sacrifice. Listen to her. Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her.
 - By centering our lives on timeless, unchanging principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of effective living. It is the center that puts all other centers in perspective.
 - Retire from your job but never from meaningful projects. If you want to live a long life, you need eustress, that is, a deep sense of meaning and of contribution to worthy projects and causes, particularly, your intergenerational family.
 - Values determine behavior; Principles determine the consequences of behavior.
 - Each of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. We see the world, not as it is, but as we are – or as we are conditioned to see it.
 - People and organizations don’t grow much without delegation and completed staff work because they are confined to the capacities of the boss and reflect both personal strengths and weaknesses.
 - Principles are the territory. Values are maps.
 - You have two ears and one mouth. Use them accordingly.
 - Our character is basically a composite of our habits. Because they are consistent, often unconcious patterns, they constantly, daily, express our character.
 - Don’t get buried in the thick of thin things.
 - Trust is a powerful accelerator to performance and when trust goes up, speed also goes up while cost comes down – producing what we call a trust dividend.
 - Effective people are not problem-minded; they’re opportunity minded. They feed opportunities and starve problems.
 - Only as we keep an open communication with our deep inner life will we have the wisdom to make effective choices.
 - Technology and tools are useful and powerful when they are your servant and not your master.
 - Principles are natural laws that are external to us and that ultimately control the consequences of our actions. Values are internal and subjective and represent that which we feel strongest about in guiding our behavior.
 - The key to the ability to change is a changeless sense of who you are, what you are about and what you value.
 - The first principle of ethical power is Purpose. By purpose, I don’t mean your objective or intention-something toward which you are always striving. Purpose is something bigger. It is the picture you have of yourself-the kind of person you want to be or the kind of life you want to lead.
 - What does it matter how much we do if what we’re doing isn’t what matters most?
 - If our feelings control our actions, it is because we have abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to do so.
 - If we can’t make and keep commitments to ourselves as well as to others, our commitments become meaningless.
 - The person who is truly effective has the humility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual limitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds of other human beings.
 - The struggle comes when we sense a gap between the clock and the compass – when what we do doesn’t contribute to what is most important in our lives.
 - Internal victories precede external victories.
 - Admission of ignorance is often the first step in our education.
 - Love – the feeling – is a fruit of love, the verb.
 - The key to motivation is motive. It’s the why. It’s the deeper yes! burning inside that makes it easier to say no to the less important.
 - Highly effective people tend to be proactive. They decide to find a better job or to have better health, rather than of responding to whatever curves life throws at them.
 - Almost all of the world-class athletes and other peak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel it; they experience it before hey actually do it. They begin with the end in mind.
 - Patience is emotional diligence.
 - Most people define greatness through wealth and popularity and position in the corner office. But what I call everyday greatness comes from character and contribution.
 - People who end up with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, who seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary to get the job done.
 - We’re often so busy cutting through the undergrowth we don’t even realise we’re in the wrong jungle.
 - Trust is a function of both character and competence. Of course you can’t trust someone who lacks integrity, but if someone is honest but they can’t perform, you’re not going to trust them either. You won’t trust them to get the job done.
 - We’re constantly making choices about the way we spend our time. The issue is not between the good and the bad, but between the good and the best. So often, the enemy of the best is the good.
 - We don’t invent our missions, we detect them.
 - It takes a great deal of character strength to apologize quickly out of one’s heart rather than out of pity.
 - Writing distills, crystallizes, and clarifies thought.
 - Make specific appointments with yourself to work on goals, and treat an appointment with yourself as you’d treat an appointment with anybody else.
 - Being humble does not mean being weak, reticent, or self-effacing. It means recognizing principle and putting it ahead of self. It means standing firmly for principle, even in the fact of opposition.
 - Synergy is the highest activity of life; it creates new untapped alternatives; it values and exploits the mental, emotional, and psychological differences between people.
 - In order to have influence, you have to be influenced.
 - You can say you love someone – but unless you demonstrate that love through your actions, your words become meaningless.
 - Frustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social mirror rather than our own values and priorities.
 - If the only vision we have of ourselves comes from the social mirror – from the current social paradigm and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of the people around us – our view of ourselves is like the reflection in a crazy mirror room at the carnival.
 - Security represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, your basic personal strength or lack of it.
 - The ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proactive person.
 - The character ethic, which I believe to be the foundation of success, teaches that there are basic principles of effective living, and that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.
 - As you live your values, your sense of identity, integrity, control, and inner-directedness will infuse you with both exhilaration and peace. You will define yourself from within, rather than by people’s opinions or by comparisons to others.
 - We tend to get what we expect – both from ourselves and from others. When we expect more, we tend to get more; when we expect less, we tend to get less.
 - We are product of neither nature nor nurture; we are a product of choice, because there is always a space between stimulus and response. As we wisely exercise our power to choose based on principles, the space will become larger.
 - Petty things become unimportant when people are impassioned about a purpose higher than self.
 - Little kindness and courtesies are so important. In relationships, the little things are the big things.
 - You can’t talk your way out of a problem you behaved your way into!
 - But borrowing strength builds weakness.
 - Words are like eggs dropped from great heights. You could no more call them back then ignore the mess they left when they fell.
 - The role of the leader is to foster mutual respect and build a complementary team where each strength is made productive and each weakness irrelevant.
 - Creating and integrating an empowering personal mission statement is one of the most important investments we can make.
 - You can’t have the fruits without the roots. It’s the principle of sequencing: Private Victories proceed Public Victories. Self-mastery and self-discipline are the foundation of good relationships with others.
 - It takes courage to realize that you are greater than your moods, greater than your thoughts, and that you can control your moods and thoughts.
 - Creating a warm, caring, supportive, encouraging environment is probably the most important thing you can do for your family.
 - We develop our character muscles by overcoming challenges and obstacles.
 - Moral authority comes from following universal and timeless principles like honesty, integrity, treating people with respect.
 - Peace of mind comes when your life is in harmony with true principles and values and in no other way.
 - I win the private victory when I have made my mind up and commit to live by correct principles and to serve worthy purposes.
 - Our character is basically a composite of our habits.
 - To blame and accuse other people, is to choose to empower them, to control us.
 - The first job of a leader-at work or at home-is to inspire trust. It’s to bring out the best in people by entrusting them with meaningful stewardships, and to create an environment in which high-trust interaction inspires creativity and possibility.
 - The most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but what we are.
 - By behaving in ways that build trust with one, you build trust with many.
 - Keeping a personal journal a daily in-depth analysis and evaluation of your experiences is a high-leverage activity that increases self-awareness and enhances all the endowments and the synergy among them.
 - When you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air.
 - The personal power that comes from principle-centered living is the power of a self-aware, knowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or by many of the circumstances and environmental influences that limit other people.
 - Empathy takes time, and efficiency is for things, not people.
 - Above all, success in business requires two things: a winning competitive strategy, and superb organizational execution. Distrust is the enemy of both. I submit that while high trust won’t necessarily rescue a poor strategy, low trust will almost always derail a good one.
 - If we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps appropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum change, we need to work on our basic paradigms.
 - As you care less about what people think of you, you will care more about what others think of themselves.
 - One of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In doing so, we build the trust of those who are present.
 - Involve people in the problem and work out the solution together.
 - It is possible to be busy-very busy-without being very effective.
 - My behavior is a product of my own conscious choices based on principles, rather than a product of my conditions, based on feelings.
 - A long, healthy, and happy life is the result of making contributions, of having meaningful projects that are personally exciting and contribute to and bless the lives of others.
