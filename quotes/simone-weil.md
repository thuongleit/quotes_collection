 - Someone who does not see a pane of glass is not aware of not seeing it.
 - It is only from the light which streams constantly from heaven that a tree can derive the energy to strike its roots deep into the soil. The tree is in fact rooted in the sky.
 - The danger is not lest the soul should doubt whether there is any bread, but lest, by a lie, it should persuade itself that it is not hungry.
 - There is no detachment where there is no pain. And there is no pain endured without hatred or lying unless detachment is present too.
 - The capacity to give one’s attention to a sufferer is a very rare and difficult thing; it is almost a miracle; it is a miracle. Nearly all those who think they have the capacity do not possess it.

 - Attachment is the great fabricator of illusions; reality can be obtained only by someone who is detached.

 - The beauty of the world is Christ’s tender smile for us coming through matter.

 - All the tragedies which we can imagine return in the end to the one and only tragedy: the passage of time.
 - Money destroys human roots wherever it is able to penetrate, by turning desire for gain into the sole motive. It easily manages to outweigh all other motives, because the effort it demands of the mind is so very much less. Nothing is so clear and so simple as a row of figures.
 - The contradictions the mind comes up against, these are the only realities, the criterion of the real. There is no contradiction in what is imaginary. Contradiction is the test of necessity.
 - Evil being the root of mystery, pain is the root of knowledge.
 - A beautiful woman looking at her image in the mirror may very well believe the image is herself. An ugly woman knows it is not.
 - Patriotism is idolatry of the self.
 - School children and students who love God should never say: “For my part I like mathematics”; “I like French”; “I like Greek.” They should learn to like all these subjects, because all of them develop that faculty of attention which, directed toward God, is the very substance of prayer.
 - It is only necessary to know that love is a direction and not a state of the soul. If one is unaware of this, one falls to despair at the first onslaught of affliction.
 - The supernatural virtue of justice consists of behaving exactly as though there were equality when one is the stronger in an unequal relationship.
 - Justice consists in seeing that no harm is done to men. Whenever a man cries inwardly: ‘Why am I being hurt?’ harm is being done to him. He is often mistaken when he tries to define the harm, and why and by whom it is being inflicted on him. But the cry itself is infallible.
 - Liberty, taking the word in its concrete sense, consists in the ability to choose.

 - Two prisoners whose cells adjoin communicate with each other by knocking on the wall. The wall is the thing which separates them but is also their means of communication. It is the same with us and God. Every separation is a link.
 - Intellectual adherence is never owed to anything whatsoever, for it is never in any degree a voluntary thing. Attention alone is voluntary. It alone forms the subject of an obligation.

 - Stars and blossoming fruit-trees: utter permanence and extreme fragility give an equal sense of eternity.
 - Algebra and money are essentially levelers; the first intellectually, the second effectively.
 - Religion is a form of nourishment. It is difficult to appreciate the flavor and food-value of something one has never eaten.

 - The world is the closed door. It is a barrier. And at the same time it is the way through.
 - There is an easiness in salvation which is more difficult to us than all our efforts.
 - The appetite for power, even for universal power, is only insane when there is no possibility of indulging it; a man who sees the possibility opening before him and does not try to grasp it, even at the risk of destroying himself and his country, is either.
 - If a young girl is being forced into a brothel she will not talk about her rights. In such a situation the word would sound ludicrously inadequate.
 - A mind enclosed in language is in prison.

 - Imagination and fiction make up more than three quarters of our real life.
 - Every kind of reward constitutes a degradation of energy.
 - A test of what is real is that it is hard and rough. Joys are found in it, not pleasure. What is pleasant belongs to dreams.
 - Creation is an act of love and it is perpetual.
 - A society like the Church, which claims to be Divine is perhaps more dangerous on account of the ersatz good which it contains then on account of the evil which sullies it. Something of the social labelled divine: an intoxicating mixture which carries with it every sort of license. Devil disguised.
 - The real sin of idolatry is always committed on behalf of something similar to the State.
 - The real stumbling-block of totalitarian regimes is not the spiritual need of men for freedom of thought; it is men’s inability to stand the physical and nervous strain of a permanent state of excitement, except during a few years of their youth.

 - The struggle between the opponents and defenders of capitalism is a struggle between innovators who do not know what innovation to make and conservatives who do not know what to conserve.

 - A right which goes unrecognized by anybody is not worth very much.
 - The work of art which I do not make, none other will ever make.
 - If we are suffering illness, poverty, or misfortune, we think we shall be satisfied on the day it ceases. But there too, we know it is false; so soon as one has got used to not suffering one wants something else.
 - To be innocent is to bear the weight of the entire universe. It is to throw away the counterweight.
 - Human existence is so fragile a thing and exposed to such dangers that I cannot love without trembling.
 - Affliction hardens and discourages us because, like a red hot iron, it stamps the soul to its very depths with the scorn, the disgust, and even the self-hatred and sense of guilt that crime logically should produce but actually does not.
 - Bourgeois society is infected by monomania: the monomania of accounting. For it, the only thing that has value is what can be counted in francs and centimes. It never hesitates to sacrifice human life to figures which look well on paper, such as national budgets or industrial balance sheets.

 - An atheist may be simply one whose faith and love are concentrated on the impersonal aspects of God.
 - If it were conceivable that in obeying God one should bring about one’s own damnation whilst in disobeying him one could be saved, I should still choose the way of obedience.
 - We are like horses who hurt themselves as soon as they pull on their bits – and we bow our heads. We even lose consciousness of the situation, we just submit. Any re-awakening of thought is then painful.
 - To die for God is not a proof of faith in God. To die for an unknown and repulsive convict who is a victim of injustice, that is a proof of faith in God.

 - Official history is a matter of believing murderers on their own word.
 - It is much easier to imagine ourselves in the place of God the Creator than in the place of Christ crucified.
 - The word ‘revolution’ is a word for which you kill, for which you die, for which you send the labouring masses to their deaths; but which does not contain any content.
 - It may be that vice, depravity, and crime are nearly always, or even perhaps always, in their essence, attempts to eat beauty, to eat what we should only look at.
 - Time’s violence rends the soul, by the rent eternity enters.
 - Renunciation is submission to time.
 - Whenever a human being, through the commission of a crime, has become exiled from good, he needs to be reintegrated with it through suffering. The suffering should be inflicted with the aim of bringing the soul to recognize freely some day that its infliction was just.
 - Time does us violence; it is the only violence.
 - The miser deprives himself of his treasure because of his desire for it.
 - Truth is one, but error is manifold.

 - One of the most exquisite pleasures of human love – to serve the loved one without his knowing it – is only possible, as regards the love of God, through atheism.

 - Modern war appears as a struggle led by all the State apparatuses and their general staffs against all men old enough to bear arms...
 - There is one, and only one, thing in modern society more hideous than crime namely, repressive justice.
 - We should do only those righteous actions which we cannot stop ourselves from doing...
 - Life does not need to mutilate itself in order to be pure.
 - Force is as pitiless to the man who possesses it, or thinks he does, as it is to its victims; the second it crushes, the first it intoxicates. The truth is, nobody really possesses it.
 - What a country calls its vital economic interests are not the things which enable its citizens to live, but the things which enable it to make war. Petrol is more likely than wheat to be a cause of international conflict.
 - When literature becomes deliberately indifferent to the opposition of good and evil it betrays its function and forfeits all claim to excellence.
 - The speed with which bureaucracy has invaded almost every branch of human activity is something astounding once one thinks about it.

 - The most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know.
 - Contemplating an object fixedly with the mind, asking myself, ‘What is it?’ without thinking of any other object or relating it to anything else for hours on end.
 - Imagination is always the fabric of social life and the dynamic of history. The influence of real needs and compulsions, of real interests and materials, is indirect because the crowd is never conscious of it.
 - To want friendship is a great fault. Friendship ought to be a gratuitous joy, like the joys afforded by art or life.

 - The full expression of personality depends upon its being inflated by social prestige; it is a social privilege.
 - God’s love for us is not the reason for which we should love him. God’s love for us is the reason for us to love ourselves.

 - The whole of our civilization is founded on specialization, which implies the enslavement of those who execute to those who coordinate...
 - In the intellectual order, the virtue of humility is nothing more nor less than the power of attention.
 - The human soul has need of security and also of risk. The fear of violence or of hunger or of any other extreme evil is a sickness of the soul. The boredom produced by a complete absence of risk is also a sickness of the soul.
 - I suffer more from the humiliations inflicted by my country than from those inflicted on her.
 - There are only two sorts of greatness: true greatness, which is of a spiritual order, and the old, old lie of world conquest. Conquest is an ersatz greatness.

 - In this world we live in a mixture of time and eternity. Hell would be pure time.
 - If there were no affliction in this world we might think we were in paradise.
 - Only an indirect method is effective. We do nothing if we have not first drawn back.
 - We must wish either for that which actually exists or for that which cannot in any way exist or, still better, for both. That which is and that which cannot be are both outside the realm of becoming.
 - Meditation on the chance which led to the meeting of my mother and father is even more salutary than meditation on death.
 - What is surprising is not that oppression should make its appearance only after higher forms of economy have been reached, but that it should always accompany them.
 - The villagers seldom leave the village; many scientists have limited and poorly cultivated minds apart from their specialty...
 - All the Freudian system is impregnated with the prejudice which it makes it its mission to fight – the prejudice that everything sexual is vile.
 - War, which perpetuates itself under the form of preparation for war, has once and for all given the State an important role in production.
 - It is not my business to think about myself. My business is to think about God. It is for God to think about me.
 - To write the lives of the great in separating them from their works necessarily ends by above all stressing their pettiness, because it is in their work that they have put the best of themselves.
 - Truth is sought not because it is truth but because it is good.
 - Our science is like a store filled with the most subtle intellectual devices for solving the most complex problems, and yet we are almost incapable of applying the elementary principles of rational thought.
 - A work of art has an author and yet, when it is perfect, it has something which is anonymous about it.
 - Every time that I think of the crucifixion of Christ, I commit the sin of envy.
 - Misfortunes leave wounds which bleed drop by drop even in sleep; thus little by little they train man by force and dispose him to wisdom in spite of himself. Man must learn to think ofhimself as a limited and dependent being; and only suffering teaches him this.
 - We can only know one thing about God – that he is what we are not. Our wretchedness alone is an image of this. The more we contemplate it, the more we contemplate him.
 - A man whose mind feels that it is captive would prefer to blind himself to the fact. But if he hates falsehood, he will not do so; and in that case he will have to suffer a lot. He will beat his head against the wall until he faints. He will come to again.
 - The payment of debts is necessary for social order. The non-payment is quite equally necessary for social order. For centuries humanity has oscillated, serenely unaware, between these two contradictory necessities.
 - The entire universe is nothing but a great metaphor.
 - The poison of skepticism becomes, like alcoholism, tuberculosis, and some other diseases, much more virulent in a hitherto virgin soil.
 - The feeding of those that are hungry is a form of contemplation.
 - Electra weeping for the dead Orestes. If we love God while thinking that he does not exist, he will manifest his existence.
 - There can be a true grandeur in any degree of submissiveness, because it springs from loyalty to the laws and to an oath, and not from baseness of soul.

 - It is human misery and not pleasure which contains the secret of the divine wisdom.
 - Religion as a source of consolation is an obstacle to true faith.

 - Nothing is less instructive than a machine.
 - Art has no immediate future, because all art is collective and there is no more collective life.
 - With no matter what human being, taken individually, I always find reasons for concluding that sorrow and misfortune do not suit him; either because he seems too mediocre for anything so great, or, on the contrary, too precious to be destroyed.
 - Education-whether its object be children or adults, individuals or an entire people-consists in creating motives.

 - The essential thing to know about God is that God is Good. All the rest is secondary.
 - Sin is not a distance, it is a turning of our gaze in the wrong direction.

 - We must love all facts, not for their consequences, but because in each fact God is there present.
 - The joy of learning is as indispensable in study as breathing is in running. Where it is lacking there are no real students, but only poor caricatures of apprentices who, at the end of their apprenticeship, will not even have a trade.
 - One should identify oneself with the universe itself. Everything that is less than the universe is subjected to suffering.
 - The difference between more or less intelligent men is like the difference between criminals condemned to life imprisonment in smaller or larger cells. The intelligent man who is proud of his intelligence is like a condemned man who is proud of his large cell.
 - Science is voiceless; it is the scientists who talk.
 - The only great spirit of our time.
 - The essential characteristic of the first half of the twentieth century is the growing weakness, and almost the disappearance, of the idea of value.
 - It is not the cause for which men took up arms that makes a victory more just or less, it is the order that is established when arms have been laid down.
 - The soul is the human being considered as having a value in itself.
 - When a man’s life is destroyed or damaged by some wound or privation of soul or body, which is due to other men’s actions or negligence, it is not only his sensibility that suffers but also his aspiration toward the good. Therefore there has been sacrilege towards that which is sacred in him.
