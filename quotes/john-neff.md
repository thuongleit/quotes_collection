 - It’s not always easy to do what’s not popular, but that’s where you make your money. Buy stocks that look bad to less careful investors and hang on until their real value is recognized.
 - Successful stocks don’t tell you when to sell. When you feel like bragging, it’s probably time to sell.
 - I don’t want a lot of good investments; I want a few outstanding ones.
 - I don’t read, much less follow, the valuations or predictions. I study the numbers.
 - Buy on the cannons and sell on the trumpets.
 - I’ve never bought a stock unless, in my view, it was on sale.
 - Investment success does not require glamour stocks or bull markets.
 - An awful lot of people keep a stock too long because it gives them warm fuzzies – particularly when a contrarian stance has been vindicated. If they sell it, they lose bragging rights.
