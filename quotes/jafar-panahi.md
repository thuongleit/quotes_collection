 - If we could tell a film, then why make a film?
 - When a filmmaker does not make films, it is as if he is jailed. Even when he is freed from the small jail, he finds himself wandering in a larger jail. The main question is: why should it be a crime to make a movie? A finished film, well, it can get banned but not the director.
 - You mustnâ€™t look at a film with only one point of view.
