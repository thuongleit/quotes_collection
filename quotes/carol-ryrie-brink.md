 - If at first you don’t fricassee, Fry, fry a hen!
 - Life is just a lot of everyday adventures.
 - The most truly generous persons are those who give silently without hope of praise or reward.
 - How far I’ve come! I’m the same girl and yet not the same. I wonder if it’s always like that? Folks keep growing from one person into another all their lives, and life is just a lot of everyday adventures. Well, whatever life is, I like it.
