 - We are the sum total of our experiences.
 - What we believe is heavily influenced by what we think others believe.
 - When we do cross paths with people whose beliefs and attitudes conflict with our own, we are rarely challenged.
 - People will always prefer black-and-white over shades of grey, and so there will always be the temptation to hold overly-simplified beliefs and to hold them with excessive confidence.
 - We seek opinions that are likely to support what we want to be true.
