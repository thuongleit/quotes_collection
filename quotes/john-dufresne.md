 - The purpose of the first draft is not to get it right, but to get it written.

 - I revise like crazy. I start revising before the pen hits the paper.
 - I write with a fountain pen. And then revise word by word and line by line so that the first draft of a scene is usually the tenth or so draft.
 - Novels are written, not wished into existence. You have to sit your ass in the chair or nothing gets done.
 - The facts, however, are unimportant in fiction. It’s not the events of my life that I mine, but the emotional experiences I’ve had.

 - Love is always a surprise and you never get it right.
 - You will feel discouraged; you will lose confidence in your abilities; you will be bored with the characters–and the only way to overcome these obstacles is to write your way through them. And writing always works.
 - At the heart of all good fiction and at the heart of all good gossip is the same thing: trouble.

 - It’s easier to write about a place sometimes when you’ve left it, when you can apply your imagination to your memory and let your emotions guide the writing about a place.

 - A lack of narrative structure, as you know, will cause anxiety.
 - We all sleep with the corpses of our dead lovers.
 - I had begun what I thought might be a career in social work. I was married and deeply involved in the anti-war movement. I thought I’d go about saving the world one person at a time. I worked with kids, teenagers mostly, in neighborhood centers, on the streets, and eventually in a drop-in center.
 - I learned to love stories by listening to them.
 - Every act of loving affirms the goodness of the lover just because he is capable of loving and being loved.
