 - Those people who are always improving never become great. Greatness is an eminence, the ascent to which is steep and lofty, and which a man must seize on at once by natural boldness and vigor, and not by patient, wary steps.

 - Whatever interests is interesting.
 - We are never so much disposed to quarrel with others as when we are dissatisfied with ourselves.
 - Do not keep on with a mockery of friendship after the substance is gone – but part, while you can part friends. Bury the carcass of friendship: it is not worth embalming.
 - There are some persons who never succeed from being too indolent to undertake anything; and others who regularly fail, because the instant they find success in their power, they grow indifferent, and give over the attempt.

 - Man is a make-believe animal: he is never so truly himself as when he is acting a part.
 - When one can do better than everyone else in the same walk, one does not make any very painful exertions to outdo oneself. The progress of improvement ceases nearly at the point where competition ends.

 - Languages happily restrict the mind to what is of its own native growth and fitted for it, as rivers and mountains bond countries; or the empire of learning, as well as states, would become unwieldy and overgrown.

 - The most rational cure after all for the inordinate fear of death is to set a just value on life.

 - A proud man is satisfied with his own good opinion, and does not seek to make converts to it.

 - To think justly, we must understand what others mean. To know the value of our thoughts, we must try their effect on other minds.

 - One shining quality lends a lustre to another, or hides some glaring defect.
 - As hypocrisy is said to be the highest compliment to virtue, the art of lying is the strongest acknowledgment of the force of truth.
 - What passes in the world for talent or dexterity or enterprise is often only a want of moral principle. We may succeed where others fail, not from a greater share of invention, but from not being nice in the choice of expedients.

 - None but those who are happy in themselves can make others so.
 - There is no prejudice so strong as that which arises from a fancied exemption from all prejudice.

 - Political truth is libel; religious truth, blasphemy.
 - All is without form and void. Someone said of his landscapes that they were pictures of nothing and very like.

 - The player envies only the player, the poet envies only the poet.
 - When I take up a book I have read before, I know what to expect; the satisfaction is not lessened by being anticipated. I shake hands with, and look our old tried and valued friend in the face, – compare notes and chat the hour away.

 - Learning is its own exceeding great reward; and at the period of which we speak, it bore other fruits, not unworthy of it.
 - We prefer a person with vivacity and high spirits, though bordering upon insolence, to the timid and pusillanimous; we are fonder of wit joined to malice than of dullness without it.
 - We learn to curb our will and keep our overt actions within the bounds of humanity, long before we can subdue our sentiments and imaginations to the same mild tone.
 - He who does nothing renders himself incapable of doing any thing; but while we are executing any work, we are preparing and qualifying ourselves to undertake another.
 - Greatness is great power, producing great effects. It is not enough that a man has great power in himself, he must shew it to all the world in a way that cannot be hid or gainsaid.

 - What is popular is not necessarily vulgar; and that which we try to rescue from fatal obscurity had in general much better remain where it is.
 - Cant is the voluntary overcharging or prolongation of a real sentiment; hypocrisy is the setting up a pretension to a feeling you never had and have no wish for.
