 - It is interesting how keen people are for you to do something they would never dream of doing themselves, how enthusiasticall y they drive you to your own destruction.
 - Reality might be described as the eternal equipoise of positive and negative.
 - The woman who thinks she can choose femininity, can toy with it like the social drinker toys with wine – well, she’s asking for it, asking to be undone, devoured, asking to spend her life perpetrating a new fraud, manufacturing a new fake identity, only this time it’s her equality that’s fake.
 - That’s writing for you: when you make space for passion, it doesn’t turn up.

 - If love is what is held to make us immortal, hatred is the reverse.
 - The distinctive feature of my family was intolerance of sensitivity and emotion – ‘Everything’s great, it all has to be great all the time and why do you have to spoil it?’ Whereas probably the most fundamental and important thing to me has been defending my right to tell the truth about how I feel.
 - How can there be so many mothers in the world but so little sense of what it might be to become one?

 - Even if they knew the truth of their own feelings, most mothers would be socially and emotionally incapable of revealing it.
 - I remain fascinated by where you go as a woman once you are a mother, and if you ever come back.

 - Hope is like one of those orchids that grows around toxic waste: lovely in itself – and an assertion, if you like, of indefatigable good – but a sure sign that something nasty lies underneath.
 - Modern morality is all about perception.
 - A feminist man is a bit like a vegetarian: it’s the humanitarian principle he’s defending, I suppose.

 - The ‘good’ mother, with her fixed smile, her rigidity, her goody-goody outlook, her obsession with unnecessary hygiene, is in fact a fool. It is the ‘bad’ mother, unafraid of a joke and a glass of wine, richly self-expressive, scornful of suburban values, who is, in reality, good.
 - The British have always made terrible parents.
 - I suppose, I said, it is one definition of love, the belief in something that only the two of you can see.
 - I have no sense of a model or predecessor when I write a memoir: For me, the form exists as a method of processing material that retains too many connections to life to be approached strictly and aesthetically. A memoir is a risk, a one-off, a bastard child.
 - Writing, more than any other art, is indexed to the worthiness of the self because it is identified in peoples minds with emotion.

 - A neighbor is something that belongs to the stable world of home life, the thing that lives next door to you.
 - It is living, not thinking, as a feminist that has become the challenge.

 - I don’t really believe in stories, only in the people who tell them.
 - Feminism remains something that needs to be explained to people.
 - I don’t go to church any more, but I think that Catholicism is rather like the brand they use on cattle: I feel so formed in that Catholic mould that I don’t think I could adopt any other form of spirituality. I still get feelings of consolation about churches.
 - I think a lot of artists no longer want to participate in or be associated with narrative because of its corruptedness in contemporary culture.
 - Divorce also entails the beginning of a supposition that that familial reality might have obstructed one’s ability to perceive others.
