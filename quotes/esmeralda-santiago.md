 - Tell me who you walk with, and I’ll tell you who you are.
 - What doesn’t kill you, makes you fat.
 - How can you know what you’re capable of if you don’t embrace the unkown?
 - For me, the person I was becoming when we left was erased, and another one was created.
 - In the twenty-one years I lived with my mother, we moved at least twenty times.
 - I learned you pay for your happiness. That’s why I don’t expect to be happy all the time. I’d rather be surprised by one moment every so often to remind me that joy is possible, even if I have to pay for it later.
