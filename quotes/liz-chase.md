 - Hope is not pretending that troubles donâ€™t exist. It is the trust that they will not last forever, that hurts will be healed and difficulties overcome. It is faith that a source of strength and renewal lies within to lead us through the dark into the sunshine.
 - Over my slumbers your loving watch keep; Rock me to sleep, mother; rock me to sleep.
