 - Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know.
 - You are the sky. Everything else – it’s just the weather.
 - Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It’s a relationship between equals. Only when we know our own darkness well can we be present with the darkness of others. Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity.
 - Let difficulty transform you. And it will. In my experience, we just need help in learning how not to run away.
 - Only to the extent that we expose ourselves over and over to annihilation can that which is indestructible in us be found.
 - We are not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human experience and Infinite love is the only truth; everything else is an illusion.
 - Feel the feelings and drop the story.
 - Be kinder to yourself. And then let your kindness flood the world.
 - Having compassion starts and ends with having compassion for all those unwanted parts of ourselves. The healing comes from letting there be room for all of this to happen: room for grief, for relief, for misery, for joy.
 - This very moment is the perfect teacher, and, lucky for us, it’s with us wherever we go.
 - If you’re invested in security and certainty, you are on the wrong planet.
 - We work on ourselves in order to help others, but also we help others in order to work on ourselves.
 - To cultivate equanimity we practice catching ourselves when we feel attraction or aversion, before it hardens into grasping or negativity.
 - The most complete and true happiness comes in moments when you feel right there, completely present, with no ideas about good and bad, right and wrong – just a sense of open heart and open mind.
 - Difficult people are the greatest teachers.
 - The most fundamental aggression to ourselves, the most fundamental harm we can do to ourselves, is to remain ignorant by not having the courage and the respect to look at ourselves honestly and gently.
 - We already have everything we need.
 - We think that the point is to pass the test or to overcome the problem, but the truth is that things don’t really get solved. They come together and they fall apart.
 - Just where you are-that’s the place to start!
 - The spiritual journey involves going beyond hope and fear, stepping into unknown territory, continually moving forward. The most important aspect of being on the spiritual path may be just to keep moving.
 - Since death is certain and the time of death is uncertain, what is the most important thing?
 - The ego seeks to divide and separate. Spirit seeks to unify and heal.
 - To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest. To live fully is to be always in no-man’s-land, to experience each moment as completely new and fresh. To live is to be willing to die over and over again.
 - All you need to know is that the future is wide open and you are about to create it by what you do.
 - Our true nature is like a precious jewel: although it may be temporarily buried in mud, it remains completely brilliant and unaffected. We simply have to uncover it.
 - Let your curiosity be greater than your fear.
 - Determination means to use every challenge you meet as an opportunity to open your heart and soften, determined to not withdraw.
 - Feelings like disappointment, embarrassment, irritation, resentment, anger, jealousy, and fear, instead of being bad news, are actually very clear moments that teach us where it is that we’re holding back.
 - Sticking with that uncertainty, getting the knack of relaxing in the midst of chaos, learning not to panic-this is the spiritual path.
 - Pain is not a punishment; pleasure is not a reward.
 - Resistance to unwanted circumstances has the power to keep those circumstances alive and well for a very long time.
 - Impermanence is a principle of harmony. When we don’t struggle against it, we are in harmony with reality.
 - If we learn to open our hearts, anyone, including the people who drive us crazy, can be our teacher.
 - The essence of generosity is letting go. Pain is always a sign that we are holding on to something – usually ourselves.
 - Usually we think that brave people have no fear. The truth is that they are intimate with fear.
 - The idea of karma is that you continually get the teaching that you need to open your heart.
 - Fear is a natural reaction of moving closer to the truth. If we commit ourselves to staying right where we are, then our experience becomes very vivid. Things become very clear when there is nowhere to escape.
 - Nothing ever goes away until it has taught us what we need to know. Even if we run a hundred miles an hour to the other side of the continent, we find the very same problem awaiting us when we arrive.
 - Welcome the present moment as if you had invited it. It is all we ever have, so we night as well work with it rather than struggling against it. We might as well make it our friend and teacher rather than our enemy.
 - If someone comes along and shoots an arrow into your heart, it’s fruitless to stand there and yell at the person. It would be much better to turn your attention to the fact that there’s an arrow in your heart...
 - We have a choice. We can spend our whole life suffering because we can’t relax with how things really are, or we can relax and embrace the open-endedness of the human situation, which is fresh, unfixated, unbiased.
 - This moving away from comfort and security, this stepping out into what is unknown, uncharted and shaky – that’s called liberation.
 - As we learn to have compassion for ourselves, the circle of compassion for others – what and whom we can work with, and how – becomes wider.
 - The future is completely open and we are writing it moment to moment.
 - If it’s painful, you become willing not just to endure it but also to let it awaken your heart and soften you. You learn to embrace it.
 - Whatever is happening is the path to enlightenment.
 - The Process of becoming unstuck requires tremendous bravery, because basically we are completely changing our way of perceiving reality...
 - It’s a transformative experience to simply pause instead of immediately filling up space.
 - There comes a time when the bubble of ego is popped and you can’t get the ground back for an extended period of time. Those times, when you absolutely cannot get it back together, are the most rich and powerful times in our lives.
 - A further sign of health is that we don’t become undone by fear and trembling, but we take it as a message that it’s time to stop struggling and look directly at what’s threatening us.
 - If you aren’t feeding the fire of anger or the fire of craving by talking to yourself, then the fire doesn’t have anything to feed on.
 - The truth you believe and cling to makes you unavailable to hear anything new.
 - To be fully alive, fully human, and completely awake is to be continually thrown out of the nest.
 - Don’t get caught up in hopes of what you’ll achieve and how good your situation will be some day in the future. What you do right now is what matters.
 - What if rather than being disheartened by the ambiguity, the uncertainty of life, we accepted it and relaxed into it?
 - Compassion becomes real when we recognize our shared humanity.
 - The first noble truth of the Buddha is that when we feel suffering, it doesn’t mean that something is wrong. What a relief.
 - Like all explorers, we are drawn to discover what’s out there without knowing yet if we have the courage to face it.
 - We don’t set out to save the world; we set out to wonder how other people are doing and to reflect on how our actions affect other people’s hearts.
 - I can’t overestimate the importance of accepting ourselves exactly as we are right now, not as we wish we were or think we ought to be.
 - The most difficult times for many of us are the ones we give ourselves.
 - The root of suffering is resisting the certainty that no matter what the circumstances, uncertainty is all we truly have.
 - Rejoicing in ordinary things is not sentimental or trite. It actually takes guts. Each time we drop our complaints and allow everyday good fortune to inspire us, we enter the warrior’s world.
 - If we’re willing to give up hope that insecurity and pain can be eliminated, then we can have the courage to relax with the groundlessness of our situation. This is the first step on the path.
 - The essence of bravery is being without self-deception.
 - Knowing pain is a very important ingredient of being there for another person.
 - The more we witness our emotional reactions and understand how they work, the easier it is to refrain.
 - Each time you stay present with fear and uncertainty, you’re letting go of a habitual way of finding security and comfort.
 - Never give up on yourself. Then you will never give up on others.
 - Don’t worry about achieving. Don’t worry about perfection. Just be there each moment as best you can.
 - Whatever happens in your life, joyful or painful, do not be swept away by reactivity. Be patient with yourself and don’t lose your sense of perspective.
 - The central question of a warrior’s training is not how we avoid uncertainty and fear but how we relate to discomfort.
 - The trick is to keep exploring and not bail out, even when we find out that something is not what we thought.
 - Never underestimate the desire to bolt.
 - You build inner strength through embracing the totality of your experience, both the delightful parts and the difficult parts.
 - All ego really is, is our opinions, which we take to be solid, real, and the absolute truth about how things are.
 - Allow situations in your life to become your teacher.
 - So war and peace start in the human heart. Whether that heart is open or whether that heart closes has global implications.
 - Without giving up hope – that there’s somewhere better to be, that there’s someone better to be – we will never relax with where we are or who we are.
 - Most spiritual experiences begin with suffering. They begin with groundlessness. They begin when the rug has been pulled out from under us.
 - One way to practice staying present is to simply sit still for a while and listen. For one minute, listen to the sounds close to you. For one minute, listen to the sounds at a distance. Just listen attentively.
 - This genuine heart of sadness can teach us great compassion. It can humble us when we’re arrogant and soften us when we are unkind.
 - By not knowing, not hoping to know and not acting like we know what’s happening, we begin to access our inner strength.
 - Although we have the potential to experience the freedom of a butterfly, we mysteriously prefer the small and fearful cocoon of ego.
 - We sow the seeds of our future hells or happiness by the way we open or close our minds right now.
 - In practicing meditation, we’re not trying to live up to some kind of ideal – quite the opposite. We’re just being with our experience, whatever it is.
 - I equate ego with trying to figure everything out instead of going with the flow. That closes your heart and your mind to the person or situation that’s right in front of you, and you miss so much.
 - Fear is a natural reaction to moving closer to the truth.
 - At some point, we realize that what we do for ourselves benefits others, and what we do for others benefits us.
 - Lower your standards and relax as it is.
 - Trying to run away is never the answer to being a fully human. Running away from the immediacy of our experience is like preferring death to life.
 - Our neurosis and our wisdom are made out of the same material. If you throw out your neurosis, you also throw out your wisdom.
 - The teacher will never give up on the student no matter how mixed up he or she might be.
 - The best spiritual instruction is when you wake up in the morning and say, ‘I wonder what’s going to happen today.’ And then carry that kind of curiosity through your life.
 - The biggest obstacle to taking a bigger perspective on life is that our emotions capture and blind us.
 - When you have made good friends with yourself, your situation will be more friendly too.
 - Meditation takes us just as we are, with our confusion and our sanity. This complete acceptance of ourselves as we are is called maitri, or unconditional friendliness, a simple, direct relationship with the way we are.
 - Openness doesn’t come from resisting our fears but rather from getting to know them well.
 - When we scratch the wound and give into our addictions we do not allow the wound to heal.
 - Feeling irritated, restless, afraid, and hopeless is a reminder to listen more carefully.
 - Remember that this is not something we do just once or twice. Interrupting our destructive habits and awakening our heart is the work of a lifetime.
 - The approach is that the best way to use unwanted circumstances on the path of enlightenment is not to resist but to lean into them.
 - People get into a heavy-duty sin and guilt trip, feeling that if things are going wrong, that means that they did something bad and they are being punished. That’s not the idea at all.
 - We can drop the fundamental hope that there is a better “me” who one day will emerge. We can’t just jump over ourselves as if we were not there.
 - In meditation and in our daily lives there are three qualities that we can nurture, cultivate, and bring out. We already possess these, but they can be ripened: precision, gentleness, and the ability to let go.
 - Share the wealth. Be generous with your joy. Give away what you most want. Be generous with your insights and delights.
 - Meditation practice isn’t about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better. It’s about befriending who we are already.
 - We don’t sit in meditation to become good meditators. We sit in meditation so that we’ll be more awake in our lives.
 - To put it concisely, we suffer when we resist the noble and irrefutable truth of impermanence and death.
 - The third noble truth says that the cessation of suffering is letting go of holding on to ourselves.
 - Being fully present isn’t something that happens once and then you have achieved it; it’s being awake to the ebb and flow and movement and creation of life, being alive to the process of life itself.
 - The wisdom, the strength, the confidence – the awakened heart and mind are always accessible – here, now, always.
 - It is a commitment to respect whatever life brings that we develop wholehearted determination to use discomfort as an opportunity for awakening, rather than trying to make it disappear.
 - You must learn to sit with the restless, painful energy and not let the momentum pull you under and cause you to do the same thing over and over that’s ruining your life and the lives of those around you.
 - The root of compassion, is compassion for oneself.
 - Enlightenment is a direct experience with reality.
 - The real thing that we renounce is the tenacious hope that we could be saved from being who we are.
 - Things become clear when there is no escape.
 - When we are willing to stay even a moment with uncomfortable energy, we gradually learn not to fear it.
 - When we resist change, it’s called suffering. But when we can completely let go and not struggle against it, when we can embrace the groundlessness of our situation and relax into it’s dynamic quality, that’s called enlightenment.
 - Unconditional good heart toward others is not even a possibility unless we attend to our own demons.
 - Honesty without kindness, humor, and goodheartedness can be just mean. From the very beginning to the very end, pointing to our own hearts to discover what is true isn’t just a matter of honesty but also of compassion and respect for what we see.
 - We can let the circumstances of our lives harden us so that we become increasingly resentful and afraid, or we can let them soften us and make us kinder and more open to what scares us. We always have this choice.
 - Deep down in the human spirit, there is a reservoir of courage. It is always available, always waiting to be discovered.
 - When you begin to touch your heart or let your heart be touched, you begin to discover that it’s bottomless, that it doesn’t have any resolution, that this heart is huge, vast, and limitless. You begin to discover how much warmth and gentleness is there, as well as how much space.
 - Use what seems like poison as medicine. Use your personal suffering as the path to compassion for all beings.
 - When there’s a disappointment, I don’t know if it’s the end of the story. It may just be the beginning of a great adventure.
 - When we protect ourselves so we won’t feel pain, that protection becomes like armor, like armor that imprisons the softness of of the heart.
 - The very first noble truth of the Buddha points out that suffering is inevitable for human beings as long as we believe that things last – that they don’t disintegrate, that they can be counted on to satisfy our hunger for security.
 - All situations teach you, and often it’s the tough ones that teach you best.
 - It isn’t what happens to us that causes us to suffer; it’s what we say to ourselves about what happens.
 - Clarity and decisiveness come from the willingness to slow down, to listen to and look at what’s happening.
 - The future is the result of what we do right now.
 - The essence of practice is always the same: instead of falling prey to a chain reaction of revenge or self-hatred, we gradually learn to catch the emotional reaction and drop the story lines.
 - Even if you don’t feel appreciation, just look. Feel what you feel; take an interest and be curious.
 - If we Pause and breathe in and out, then we can have the experience of timeless presence, of the inexpressible wisdom and goodness of our own minds. We can look at the world with fresh eyes and hear things with fresh ears.
 - When you begin to touch your heart or let your heart be touched, you begin to discover that it’s bottomless.
 - That nothing is static or fixed, that all is fleeting and impermanent, is the first mark of existence. Everything is in process.
 - When things are shaky and nothing is working, we might realize that we are on the verge of something.
 - We are one blink of an eye away from being fully awake.
 - Ego is like a room of your own, a room with a view with the temperature and the smells and the music that you like. You want it your own way. You’d just like to have a little peace, you’d like to have a little happiness, you know, just gimme a break.
 - As long as our orientation is toward perfection or success, we will never learn about unconditional friendship with ourselves, nor will we find compassion.
 - Generosity is an activity that loosens us up. By offering whatever we can – a dollar, a flower, a word of encouragement – we are training in letting go.
 - True compassion does not come from wanting to help out those less fortunate than ourselves but from realizing our kinship with all beings.
 - Peace isn’t an experience free of challenges, free of rough and smooth, it’s an experience that’s expansive enough to include all that arises without feeling threatened.
 - When we feel left out, inadequate, or lonely, can we take a warrior’s perspective and contact bodhichitta?
 - Honesty without kindness, humor, and goodheartedness can be just mean.
 - Whatever you are doing, take the attitude of wanting it directly or indirectly to benefit others. Take the attitude of wanting it to increase your experience of kinship with your fellow beings.
 - Suffering begins to dissolve when we can question the belief or the hope that there’s anywhere to hide.
 - In meditation, you learn how to get out of your own way long enough for there to be room for your wisdom to manifest.
 - Things falling apart is a kind of testing and also a kind of healing.
 - Compassion practice is daring. It involves learning to relax and allowing ourselves to move gently toward what scares us.
 - Right down there in the thick of things, we discover the love that will not die.
 - In order to have compassion for others, we have to have compassion for ourselves.
 - We are all capable of becoming fundamentalists because we get addicted to other people’s wrongness.
 - One of the deepest habitual patterns that we have is to feel that now is not enough.
 - It isn’t the things that happen to us in our lives that cause us to suffer, it’s how we relate to the things that happen to us that causes us to suffer.
 - It’s not a terrible thing that we feel fear when faced with the unknown. It is part of being alive, something we all share.
 - The point is that our true nature is not some ideal that we have to live up to. It’s who we are right now, and that’s what we can make friends with and celebrate.
 - Everybody loves something, even if it’s only tortillas.
 - Feel the wounded heart that’s underneath the addiction, self-loathing, or anger.
 - At the root of all the harm we cause is ignorance.
 - There isn’t anything except your own life that can be used as ground for your spiritual practice. Spiritual practice is your life, twenty-four hours a day.
 - Constantly apply cheerfulness, if for no other reason than because you are on this spiritual path. Have a sense of gratitude to everything, even difficult emotions, because of their potential to wake you up.
 - The Buddha taught that we’re not actually in control, which is a pretty scary idea. But when you let things be as they are, you will be a much happier, more balanced, compassionate person.
 - Compassion is not a relationship between the healer and the wounded. It’s a relationship between equals.
 - It is possible to move through the drama of our lives without believing so earnestly in the character that we play.
 - Softening what is rigid in our hearts...
 - But all the time our warmth and brilliance are right here. This is who we really are. We are one blink of an eye away from being fully awake.
 - All the terrible things we do to ourselves and others from alcoholism to character assignation to abuse to murder come from one cause: the inability to stay present with an uncomfortable feeling in the body and seek short-term relief.
 - Hell is just resistance to life.
 - Don’t worry about achieving. Don’t worry about perfection. Just be there each moment as best you can. When you realize you’ve wandered off again, simply very lightly acknowledge that. This light touch is the golden key to reuniting with our openness.
 - We can stop thinking that good practice is when it’s smooth and calm, and bad practice is when it’s rough and dark. If we can hold it all in our hearts, then we can make a proper cup of tea.
 - Now is the only time. How we relate to it creates the future.
 - Simply be present with your own shifting energies and with the unpredictabilit y of life as it unfolds.
 - Surrendering, letting go of possessiveness, and complete nonattachment-all are synonyms for accumulating merit.
 - Patience takes courage. It is not an ideal state of calm. In fact, when we practice patience we will see our agitation far more clearly.
 - A warrior accepts that we can never know what will happen to us next.
 - Being preoccupied with our self-image is like being deaf and blind. It’s like standing in the middle of a vast field of wildflowers with a black hood over our heads. It’s like coming upon a tree of singing birds while wearing earplugs.
 - When resistance is gone, the demons are gone.
 - Do I prefer to grow up and relate to life directly, or do I choose to live and die in fear?
 - The truth is that good and bad coexist; sour and sweet coexist. They aren’t really opposed to each other.
 - Without loving-kindness for ourselves, it is difficult, if not impossible, to genuinely feel it for others.
 - Every day is a new opportunity to work with what you have inside toward enlightenment.
 - Until we stop clinging to the concept of good and evil, the world will continue to manifest as friendly goddesses and harmful demons.
 - Patience has nothing to do with suppression. In fact, it has everything to do with a gentle, honest relationship with yourself.
 - To live is to be willing to die over and over again.
 - When we touch the center of sorrow, when we sit with discomfort without trying to fix it, when we stay present to the pain of disapproval or betrayal and let it soften us, these are times that we connect with bohdichitta.
 - The still lake without ripples is an image of our minds at ease, so full of unlimited friendliness for all the junk at the bottom of the lake that we don’t feel the need to churn up the waters just to avoid looking at what’s there.
 - The more neurosis the more wisdom.
 - The next step is to learn to communicate with the people that you feel are causing your pain and misery- not to learn how to prove them wrong and yourself right but how to communicate from the heart.
 - All the wars, all the hatred, all the ignorance in the world come out of being so invested in our opinions.
 - None of us is ever OK, but we all get through everything just fine.
 - Life’s work is to wake up, to let the things that enter your life wake you up rather than put you to sleep.
 - Rejoicing in the good fortune of others is a practice that can help us when we feel emotionally shut down and unable to connect with others. Rejoicing generates good will.
 - We spend all our energy and waste our lives trying to re-create these zones of safety, which are always falling apart. That’s the essence of samsara – the cycle of suffering that comes from continuing to seek happiness in all the wrong places.
 - Welcome the present moment as if you had invited it. Why? Because it is all we ever have.
 - Every moment is incredibly unique and fresh, and when we drop into the moment, as meditation allows us to do, we learn how to truly taste this tender and mysterious life that we share together.
 - Once you create a self-justifying storyline, your emotional entrapment within it quadruples.
 - If we knew that tonight we were going to go blind, we would take a long, last real look at every blade of grass, every cloud formation, every speck of dust, every rainbow, raindrop-everything.
 - The only way to ease our pain is to experience it fully. Learn to stay with uneasiness, learn to stay with the tightening, so that the habitual chain reaction doesn’t continue to rule your life.
 - Somehow, in the process of trying to deny that things are always changing, we lose our sense of the sacredness of life. We tend to forget that we are part of the natural scheme of things.
 - Blaming is a way to protect your heart, trying to protect what is soft and open and tender in yourself.
 - Patience is the training in abiding with the restlessness of our energy and letting things evolve at their own speed.
 - Trying to change ourselves doesn’t work in the long run because we’re resisting our own energy. Self-improvemen t can have temporary results, but lasting transformation occurs only when we honor ourselves as the source of wisdom and compassion.
 - Compassionate action involves working with ourselves as much as working with others.
 - We cannot be present and run our story-line at the same time.
 - Searching for happiness prevents us from ever finding it.
 - Our patterns are well established, seductive, and comforting. Just wanting for them to be ventilated isn’t enough. Those of us who struggle with this know.
 - There is no cultivation of patience when your pattern is to just try to seek harmony and smooth everything out. Patience implies willingness to be alive rather than trying to seek harmony.
 - It’s helpful to remind yourself that meditation is about opening and relaxing with whatever arises, without picking and choosing.
 - Every moment is unique, unknown, completely fresh.
 - Life is like that. We don’t know anything. We call something bad; we call it good. But really we just don’t know.
 - Awareness is the key. Do we see the stories that we’re telling ourselves and question their validity?
 - There’s nothing more important on our spiritual path than developing gentleness to oneself.
 - There’s a reason you can learn from everything: you have basic wisdom, basic intelligence, and basic goodness.
 - Being satisfied with what we already have is a magical golden key to being alive in a full, unrestricted, and inspired way.
 - We hold on to hope, and hope robs us of the present moment.
 - Wholeheartedly do what it takes to awaken your clear-seeing intelligence, but one day at a time, one moment at a time. If we live that way, we will benefit this earth.
 - Treat yourself as your own beloved child.
 - Ego is something that you come to know – something that you befriend by not acting out or by repressing all the feelings that you feel.
 - I’m here to tell you that the path to peace is right there, when you want to get away.
 - There’s something delicious about finding fault with something. And that can be including finding fault with one’s self, you know?
 - The most heartbreaking thing of all is how we cheat ourselves of the present moment.
 - Words themselves are neutral. It’s the charge we add to them that matters.
 - If you work with your mind, that will alleviate all the suffering that seems to come from the outside.
 - Buddhism itself is all about empowering yourself, not about getting what you want.
 - Use your life to wake you up.
 - Everything in our lives has the potential to wake us up or put us to sleep. Allowing it to awaken us is up to us.
 - What you do for yourself, you’re doing for others, and what you do for others, you’re doing for yourself.
 - What’s encouraging about meditation is that, even if we shut down, we can no longer shut down in ignorance. We see very clearly that we’re closing off. That in itself begins to illuminate the darkness of ignorance.
 - It becomes increasingly clear that we won’t be free of self-destructive patterns unless we develop a compassionate understanding of what they are.
 - Obstacles are our friends: they teach us where we’re stuck.
 - As our kindness for ourselves grows, so does our kindness for other people.
 - We give it up and just look directly with compassion and humor at who we are. Then loneliness is no threat and heartache, no punishment.
 - In a nutshell, when life is pleasant, think of others. When life is a burden, think of others.
 - Everything that human beings feel, we feel. We can become extremely wise and sensitive to all of humanity and the whole universe simply by knowing ourselves, just as we are.
 - We can begin to open our hearts to others when we have no hope of getting anything back. We just do it for its own sake.
 - If you ask why we meditate, I would say it’s so we can become more flexible and tolerant to the present moment.
 - If there’s any possibility for enlightenment, it’s right now, not at some future time. Now is the time.
 - My moods are continuously shifting like the weather.
 - We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give everything away. Samaya means not holding anything back, not preparing our escape route, not looking for alternatives, not thinking that there is ample time to do things later.
 - Compassion starts with making friends with ourselves.
 - Gloriousness and wretchedness need each other. One inspires us, the other softens us.
 - By becoming intimate with how we close down and how we open up, we awaken our unlimited potential.
 - We practice to liberate ourselves from a burden.
 - We tend to forget that we are part of the natural scheme of things.
 - A heartfelt sense of aspiring cuts through negativity about yourself; it cuts through the heavy trips you lay on yourself.
 - Patience is not learned in safety.
 - Are you experiencing restlessness? Stay! Are fear and loathing out of control? Stay! Aching knees and throbbing back? Stay! What’s for lunch? Stay! I can’t stand this another minute! Stay!
 - Meditation isn’t really about getting rid of thoughts, it’s about changing the pattern of grasping on to things, which in our everyday experience is our thoughts.
 - Nothing in its essence is one way or the other.
 - We don’t experience the world fully unless we are willing to give everything away.
 - The greatest obstacle to connecting with our joy is resentment.
 - How do we cultivate the conditions for joy to expand? We train in staying present.
 - Discomfort of any kind becomes the basis for practice. We breathe in knowing our pain is shared.
 - As we practice, we begin to know the difference between our fantasy and reality.
 - The essence of our whole path is in that place of discomfort, and what do we do with it?
 - Ordinarily we are swept away by habitual momentum and don’t interrupt our patterns slightly. When we feel betrayed or disappointed, does it occur to us to practice?
 - According to the Buddhist belief, you can go on and on indefinitely, so you see your life as just a brief moment in time.
 - When you open the door and invite in all sentient beings as your guests, you have to drop your agenda.
 - If you’re aggressive in your dealings, that’s how you’ll be regarded in the world. You might smile and give generously, but if you frequently explode in anger, people never feel comfortable in your presence and you’ll never have peace of mind.
 - Sitting meditation gives us a way to move closer to our thoughts and emotions and to get in touch with our bodies.
 - Everything is fresh, the essence of realization.
 - While we are sitting in meditation, we are simply exploring humanity and all of creation in the form of ourselves.
 - Fear itself is the vanguard of wisdom.
 - By the way that we think and by the way that we believe in things, in that way our world is created.
 - I have all the support I need to simply relax and be with the transitional, in-process quality of my life. I have all I need to engage in the process of awakening.
 - Things are as bad and as good as they seem. There’s no need to add anything extra.
 - If your mind is expansive and unfettered, you will find yourself in a more accommodating world, a place that’s endlessly interesting and alive. That quality isn’t inherent in the place but in your state of mind.
 - In truth, there is enormous space in which to live our everyday lives.
 - Sometimes we find that we like our thoughts so much that we don’t want to let them go.
 - How will we experience the world a month, a year, or five years from now? Will we be even angrier, more grasping and fearful, or will some shift have occurred? This depends entirely on the tendencies we reinforce today.
 - We can gradually drop our ideals of who we think we ought to be, or who we think we want to be, or who we think other people think we want to be or ought to be.
 - If you follow your heart, you’re going to find that it is often extremely inconvenient.
 - Better to join in with humanity than to set ourselves apart.
 - Holding on to anything blocks wisdom.
 - Mindfulness is loving all the details of our lives, and awareness is the natural thing that happens: life begins to open up, and you realize that you’re always standing at the center of the world.
