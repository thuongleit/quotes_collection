 - Don’t see a thing working-see it finished!

 - I enjoy research as much as writing so I try to make my stories as fact-based as possible, which I think helps them seem more authentic.
 - I can sometimes gaze out of the window, at the sheep, ponies, grazing deer, and numerous woodland folk. It’s a wonderful setting in which to write. I live on a dirt road, miles from anywhere, with no neighbors.
 - Tolkien was such a brilliant writer in so many ways. He was truly an inspiration. Many people don’t realize just how much he researched and how much he based his stories and characters on mythology of various types. He was very deep and in many ways a genius.
 - I love the opportunity to just let my imagination run riot! Non-fiction can be very restrictive.
 - I enjoy creating and developing characters, as well as situations. But I have always had more ideas than I can ever put down on paper and fantasy allows me to include a lot of what I feel.
