 - Why do you need street smarts? Shrewdness? Toughness? It’s to protect something soft that is going to be in danger if it’s exposed at the wrong time and place. It’s to protect a soul. But to protect your soul, you have to have one to start with.
 - The experience of beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say. The artist’s relation to the object of beauty, how the art makes that happen, is a whole other subject. Beauty is an event. Beauty is something that happens. There is no such thing as a beautiful object or a beautiful woman.
 - The artist is a strange being. I think it’s safe to say that a real artist is conscious of having a personal singularity that is partly a blessing and partly a curse. An artist enjoys and suffers from isolation. As solitude, isolation can nurture. It can also destroy.
 - Rembrandt was way ahead of his time. It’s as if he was painting an amateur theatrical, or a professional theatrical, in his studio. It’s a kind of performance.

 - Black and white can show how something is. Color adds how it is, imbued with temperatures and humidities of experience.

 - Education is this funny thing. You deal for several years with organized information, and then you go out into the world and you never see any of that ever again. There’s no more organized information.
 - With art criticism it’s difficult to discuss beauty, to assess it, because there’s always the possibility that we’re insane.
 - It’s possible I am the only art critic that a lot of people read. And maybe Robert Hughes, if he’s still writing.
 - There’s a double standard between writers and readers. Readers can be unfaithful to writers anytime they like, but writers must never ever be unfaithful to the readers.
 - Artists are people who are subject to irrational convictions of the sacred. Baudelaire said that an artist is a child who has acquired adult capacities and discipline. Art education should help build those capacities and that discipline without messing over the child.
 - Picasso had nicknamed Georges Braque “Wilbur,” thereby becoming “Orville” in their Wright Brothers-like ambition to get painting off the ground of conventional representation.
 - A word is a thought, of course. But any image, including a photograph, may become an instrument of sufficiently lucid cogitation.

 - I have painted enough to have a lot of respect for mediocre painters. It’s really hard.
 - Artists are sometimes in a position to tell the truth, but they’re positioned as a Cassandra. They’re gifted with impeccable prophecy and the assurance of never being listened to.
 - A lot of writers and artists are like chefs who eat their own cooking in the kitchen and then deliver an empty plate with assurances that it’s great.
 - The problem of making artists talk about their work is that when they’re making their work the left-brain is shut off. So if you talk to an artist about it, you’re talking to someone who wasn’t there. It’s hopeless.
