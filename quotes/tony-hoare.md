 - I call it my billion-dollar mistake. It was the invention of the null reference in 1965.
 - I don’t know what the language of the year 2000 will look like, but I know it will be called Fortran.
 - There are two ways of constructing a software design; one way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult.
 - The unavoidable price of reliability is simplicity.
 - Inside every large program is a small program struggling to get out.
 - Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming.
 - The real value of tests is not that they detect bugs in the code but that they detect inadequacies in the methods, concentration, and skills of those who design and produce the code.
 - The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity. It is a price which the very rich may find hard to pay.
 - We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.
 - You cannot teach beginners top-down programming, because they don’t know which end is up.
 - The job of formal methods is to elucidate the assumptions upon which formal correctness depends.
 - An ultimate joint challenge for the biological and the computational sciences is the understanding of the mechanisms of the human brain, and its relationship with the human mind.
 - Some problems are better evaded than solved.
 - I couldn’t resist the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in the last forty years.
 - I was eventually persuaded of the need to design programming notations so as to maximize the number of errors which cannot be made, or if made, can be reliably detected at compile time.
 - Here is a language so far ahead of its time, that it was not only an improvement on its predecessors, but also on nearly all its successors.
