 - If any running event, you are absolutely alone. Nobody can help you.
 - Almost every part of the mile is tactically important: you can never let down, never stop thinking, and you can be beaten at almost any point. I suppose you could say it is like life.
 - Iâ€™d rather lose a 3:58 mile than win one in 4:10.
