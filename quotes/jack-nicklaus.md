 - Golf is a nice game, but that’s all. It’s never going to be an exciting game to watch on TV. It’s not a circus and never will be one. The audience for golf is not going to change significantly. It’s always going to be people who play it, understand it, and love it.
 - I’m a firm believer that in the theory that people only do their best at things they truly enjoy. It is difficult to excel at something you don’t enjoy.

 - I think that Pebble Beach is my favorite golf course to go to. I think Augusta is my favorite place to go play golf.
 - I couldn’t care less who I’m paired with. There’s nobody I’ve ever played better or worse with, thank goodness. You don’t want any factor to be outside your control. What if Arnie’s Army had bothered me? What id I’d said, “Oh geez, I’m paired with Palmer,” I’d never had beaten him.

 - It’s hard not to play golf that’s up to Jack Nicklaus standards when you are Jack Nicklaus.
 - People don’t want to go to the dump and have a picnic, they want to go out to a beautiful place and enjoy their day. And so I think our job is to try to take the environment, take what the good Lord has given us, and expand upon it or enhance it, without destroying it.
 - I like to catch fish and release them. I probably haven’t killed a fish that I’ve caught in sport fishing for 20 years. No reason to kill it. You know, just take it and release it.

 - I don’t think about winning the Masters as part of the slam. You want to win the Masters because of what it means to the game.

 - If there is one thing I have learned during my years as a professional, it is that the only thing constant about golf is its inconstancy.
 - Public appearances are a headache. I hold mine down to a minimum.

 - This is a tournament. The others are all championships.

 - If you’re going to be a player people will remember, you have to win the Open at St. Andrews.

 - And, of course, I’m constantly energized by designing courses around the world.
 - I never missed a putt in my mind.

 - The way I pack is I look at how long I’ll be gone and I pack day for day. If I’m going on a three-day fishing trip, I plot each day. I put most of that in a little bag. If I’m going from there to work on golf courses for a few days, I plot that trip.
