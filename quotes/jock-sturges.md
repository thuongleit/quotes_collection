 - It’s really, really hard to make it as a fine-art photographer exclusively.
 - But the truth is that Homo sapiens is a sensual species. I think all species are, to one degree or another.
 - I’ll go to do a shoot, I’ll spend five or six hours at the beach with people, and when people think I’m all out of film, then they really relax and I get my good pictures.
