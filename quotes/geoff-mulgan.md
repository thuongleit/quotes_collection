 - I can think of nothing worse than a think-tank where everybody agreed.
 - There are hardly any apprenticeships in care; hardly any schools preparing teenagers for jobs in care; and few signs that politicians know what to do to raise the status and rewards for what will soon be one of our most important industries.
 - Understanding capitalism is in some ways simple. At its best, capitalism rewards creators, makers and providers: the people and firms that create valuable things for others, like imaginative technologies and good food, cars and drugs.
 - The most important innovators often don’t need any technologies – just imagination and acute sensitivity to people’s needs.
