 - Schadenfreude is so nutritious.
 - Why is Mr Universe always from Earth?
 - Here we meet, on the page, naked and unadorned: shorn of class, race, gender, sexual identity, age and nationality.
 - I do have a fantasy life in which I can grout bathrooms – but not for a living.
 - A creative life cannot be sustained by approval any more than it can be destroyed by criticism.
 - The British and American literary worlds operate in an odd kind of symbiosis: our critics think our contemporary novelists are not the stuff of greatness whereas certain contemporary Americans indubitably are. Their critics often advance the exact opposite: British fiction is cool, American naff.
 - I’d rather fiddle with my phone for precious seconds than neglect an apostrophe; I’d rather insert a word laboriously keyed out than resort to predictive texting for a – acceptable to some – synonym.
 - From time to time, as if heaven-sent to annoy, someone will ask me if I’m self-disciplined when it comes to my work. I usually look witheringly at them and snarl, ‘What do you think?’ I mean, how do you imagine anyone writes a quarter of a million words a year for publication?
 - Wealth is a form of power in our society. With great power comes great responsibility. If you have too much wealth, ipso facto, you have too much power – therefore you have too much responsibility – and you’re a kind of dictator.
 - Always carry a notebook. And I mean always. The short-term memory only retains information for three minutes; unless it is committed to paper you can lose an idea for ever.
 - Is there anything more useless than a crouton? I sometimes wake up in the small hours with a start and realise that what’s roused me is an overpowering urge to visit violence on its originator.
 - I used to find myself goofed out in the street on drugs. And I had such a bad problem with addiction at the time that I didn’t mind. I was dealing cocaine and shooting up a lot of cocaine. And that’s not a good space to be in.
 - A short story is a shard, a sliver, a vignette. It’s a biopsy on the human condition but it doesn’t have this capacity to think autonomously for itself.
 - The seventies were my fattest decade. Overall I think the seventies were distinctly bulbous. People looked chunky, typefaces were rounded, writing implements penile.
 - Death, the real simile for disease – for when we are ill, do we not always feel like we are dying, even if it’s only a little? – remains, despite our secularism, the most metaphoricised phenomenon of all.
 - I think it’s a misreading of Dostoevsky to think of him as a programmatic theist. He’s actually much closer to someone like William James. He’s actually a pragmatist.
 - In our benighted age, when films about amusement park rides and electronic fidgets scoop the honours, perhaps Hollywood redux is the best we can hope for.
 - I write as someone who has no more time for repressive Islam than he does for repressive Christianity or Judaism, but at least look at the face in the hijab – and try to imagine the one beneath the niqab – before you depersonalise its wearer.
 - Always carry a notebook. And I mean always.
 - In my view, the plangent artificiality of a lot of creative work results from the fact that the people who write novels, direct films and put on plays tend to read too many novels, watch too many films and go to too many plays.
 - If the seventies were bulbous, and the eighties sharp, the nineties were nothing but bogus.
 - Don’t look back until you’ve written an entire draft...
 - Lives don’t divide up into chapters. People don’t just talk, while nothing’s going on in their head, and then respond. You know, none of these things actually happen.
 - As a bookish adolescent, I sopped up texts as if I were blotting paper and they were fluid.
 - There is a deep sadness to American poverty, greater than the sadness of any other kind. It’s because America has such an ideology of success.
 - Continuous present is all we have, and stream of consciousness – which in a novel is arguably just as artificial as the stilted dialogue that you get in most conventional novels. They’re all stratagems to try to get closer to the texture of lived life.
 - Modernism has a reputation for being a forbidding phenomenon: its visual arts disconcertingly non-representational, its literary efforts devoid of the consolations of plot and character – even its films, it’s argued, fall well short of that true desideratum: entertainment.
 - The writing life is essentially one of solitary confinement – if you can’t deal with this, you needn’t apply.
 - What more chilling indictment of the modern world is there than this: that the condition of the smartphone user is that of a dumb animal. Moooo!
 - I am a regular, if not exactly enthusiastic, patron of my local bookshop. I try to buy at least some books there because I cling to the belief that it’s important to maintain those businesses which put a human face on the exchange of money for goods and services.
 - A very beautiful young woman once asked me to sign her breasts. That was back when I was a hip young thing – it’s been all downhill since then.
 - As for critical writing about modernism, its moments of lucidity are but fulgurations illuminating the dark and incomprehensible landscape of its subject’s unabashed difficulty.
 - Just as the blurring between childhood and adulthood has produced the kidult, so the stretching of middle into old age has fostered another peculiar chimera: septuagenarians with apoptosis sporting the depeche mode.
 - Things are only boring if you are boring.
 - Without a shadow of doubt, Trafalgar Square has to be one of the most crap urban public spaces in the world.
 - So heedless have we become of our own image that second-hand mobile phones now invariably come with a SIM card chock-full of discarded intimacies.
 - As the render is to the building, and the blueprint to the machine, so sport is to social existence.
 - The life of the professional writer – like that of any freelance, whether she be a plumber or a podiatrist – is predicated on willpower. Without it there simply wouldn’t be any remuneration, period.
 - Nowadays, my mood ungoverned, I’m free to think the most outrageous things, such as: might it not be a good idea to insist that drug companies give their preparations names that tell the user what they really do?
 - The only proper suit-and-tie job I’ve had in my life was the two years in the late 1980s when I ran a small corporate publishing company. I even had a Ford Sierra!
 - I’m going to end up like one of those old weirdos who lives in a network of tunnels burrowed through trash – yet I do not fear this.
 - I make no apology for preoccupying myself with architecture, television, conceptual art, restaurants and Jane Asher’s cakes.
 - I’m English enough to feel something of a gut-reaction to modernism, to continental philosophising and anything that smacks of a refusal to pay attention to the forensics: the empirical facts on the ground.
 - If the government announced that it was going to allocate a vast tranche of education funding purely to the pupils at the best public schools, there would be a national outcry – and yet this is precisely what the Olympics represents in terms of sports funding.
 - If you believe something, you can have a morality that means something as well. You can feel recognized as an individual within the universe; it can give meaning to who you are.
 - Whatever respect photography may once have deserved is now superfluous in view of its own superfluity.
 - I don’t think in terms of that bizarre tautology ‘value for money’ in my literary and journalistic work – and nor will I in my academic role. However, if I don’t believe I’m helping my students towards a fuller and more empowering relationship with the world, then I’ll resign.
 - Sometimes it occurs to me that the job of a serious cultural critic mostly consists in telling the generality of people that their opinions – on films, on books, on all manner of widgets, gadgets and even the latest electronic fidgets – simply aren’t up to scratch.
 - The whole aesthetics of computers very much feeds into my OCD. They fill my head with obsessionalities and my actions become very repetitive. It seems quite inimical to the dreamy state out of which fiction comes which seems so much less causally repetitive than the way one works on computers.
 - Certainly, for time out of mind, an obsessive dwelling on happier former days has been synonymous with getting older, while it was the juvenescent who rushed with open arms to embrace the future.
 - If we bought everything on the Internet, our eyes and mouths and nostrils would probably begin to film over with a tegument – one initially tissue-thin and capable of being removed each morning, but which gradually thickened and hardened until we were imprisoned in our own tiny minds.
 - I write because I feel driven to write. I write from a sense of inner necessity. I don’t write for anything other than that.
 - As a writer, I’m not convinced that we are the best equipped to understand how we go about the business of literary production.
 - Because I was a young man so, of course, I did get into fights. The last time I actually was in a fight, in the sense of throwing punches myself, was probably when I was at college, not since 1980. But I remember being attacked quite a few times in the ’80s.
 - What fiction offers us is an intimacy shorn of the messy contingencies of human existence – gender, race, class or age. Those moments of transcendence when we exclaim ‘You know exactly what I mean!’ depend for much of their force on the anonymous character of the intimacy between writer and reader.
 - In survey after survey, people report that the greatest dangers they face are, in this order: terrorist attack, plane crashes and nuclear accidents. This despite the fact that these three combined have killed fewer people in the past half-century than car accidents do in any given year.
 - Like all right-listening folk, I am an implacable enemy of all muzak.
 - Whenever I produce my best work, it’s always because I’ve spent time being idle. Something always emerges after nothing.
 - Of course, with well-masticated food playing the role of social glue, it’s absolutely essential that everyone clear their plate. Sod the starving kiddies in Africa – it’s the overfed ones here we need to worry about.
 - Not only is the statistical madness an assault on individuality, it’s also one on temporality too. Statistics – even when accurate – are only an image of the past that can then be Photoshopped before being pasted on to the future.
 - A party full of ‘likeable’ people doesn’t bear contemplating.
 - Drug use and procrastination often go hand in tourniquet.
 - I think of writing as a sculptural medium. You are not building things. You are removing things, chipping away at language to reveal a living form.
 - To attempt to write seriously is always, I feel, to fail – the disjunction between my beautifully sonorous, accurate and painfully affecting mental content, and the leaden, halting sentences on the page always seems a dreadful falling short.
 - As far as I can see, the history of experimental art in the twentieth century is intimately bound up with the experience of intoxification.
 - I think in retrospect that all those ’alternative’modes of living were little more than exercises in arrested development.
 - I think the fundamental apprehension is that the city’s an organism of some form, rather than being governed from above.
 - Political activists of all stripes are usually a wacky bunch, and never more so than in a system like Britain’s, where power is effected via the quiescence of the electorate as much as its convictions.
 - Some people have human muses – mine is a city. I feel a startling ambivalence towards London, but for better or worse my work has come utterly to depend upon it.
 - The cynics are correct the sense of freewill is only that feeling which we have when we take the necessitated option that most appeals to us.
 - I prefer to write first drafts as soon as possible after waking, so that the oneiric inscape is still present to me.
 - When anyone starts out to do something creative – especially if it seems a little unusual – they seek approval, often from those least inclined to give it. But a creative life cannot be sustained by approval, any more than it can be destroyed by criticism – you learn this as you go on.
 - The great liberty of the fictional writer is to let the imagination out of the traces and see it gallop off over the horizon.
 - There is something mysteriously powerful that can happen when young, inchoate minds come into contact with older and more worldly ones in a spirit of intellectual and creative endeavour – if I believed in progress, I suppose that’s what I’d call it.
 - I think I now understand why it is that the young are so very nostalgic. They have so little by way of personal history that they polish it up and make it shine like a treasured heirloom.
 - It is not that sport, over-indulged in, coarsens the mind; it is that it dulls it.
 - The fictional work is a kind of actor that wears a satirical garb but can put on other costumes as well.
 - That tertiary education is under a sustained assault by a political and – it often seems – social consensus that equates all education with training for increased productivity, only makes academe a still more promising environment for a contrarian.
 - I enjoy doing very high mileages, partly out of masochism and also because I like to feel the shape of the landscape.
 - My novels tend to come about from a fusion of two big ideas, creating a critical mass that then fissions, throwing off hundreds of other particles, riffs, tropes and characters.
 - Most of us have had that experience – at around puberty – of realising that, despite whatever efforts we put into our chosen sports, we will become at best competent.
 - I’m an anarchist. I’m implacably opposed to heirarchical systems of power and control. I also mistrust crowds, as they often operate according to their lowest common denominator. In terms of evolutionary psychology, the crowd is very close to a herd of stampeding wildebeest.
 - Vaughn’s vision is older, wiser and harder than Ritchie’s.
 - So I was smacked up on the Prime Minister’s jet – big deal.
 - The novelist, quite rightly, fears the psychoanalyst as both an enemy and a usurper.
 - It might be an idea for all literary critics to read the books they analyse aloud – it certainly helps to fix them in the mind, while providing a readymade seminar with your audience.
 - People tend to think of their lives as having a dramatic arc, because they read too much fiction.
 - It could be argued that every age gets the comfort savagery writer it deserves.
 - Once the working classes were in chains, now they’re in chain restaurants.
 - There’s a flip side to having prominent public intellectuals, which is that they start meddling in politics and often with quite disastrous results.
 - I always wanted to write fiction. Always. As far back as I can remember it’s been integral to my sense of myself – everything else was always a displacement activity.
 - The future continues to preoccupy me as a reliable source of hopes, fears and anxieties, but increasingly the present seems to have no outstanding qualities of its own, being merely a way-station through which events travel to the vast shadow lands of the past.
 - The high arts of literature and music stand in a curious relationship to one another, at once securely comfortable and deeply uneasy – rather like a long-term marriage.
 - Live life and write about life. Of the making of many books there is indeed no end, but there are more than enough books about books.
 - You may have gathered that I am not the most cheerful of revellers – some characterise me as the death and soullessness of any party but it wasn’t always so, believe me.
 - I’m very happy for whatever plaudits might come the way of my work, but I never ever sit down to write x with y in view – whether it’s a reader, a prize or a sale.
 - I have a healthy appetite for solitude. If you don’t, you have no business being a writer.
 - I loathe computers more and more, so I have one I can shut down and shelve like a book.
 - Sometimes the crowd is the madness – at others it’s the absence of the crowd that is.
