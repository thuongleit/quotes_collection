 - The first person I ever really got starstruck over was Nicole Kidman, because I looked up to her. When I was younger, I wouldn’t get parts because of how tall I was. I had the body of a 15-year-old but the face of a 12-year-old. I always looked at Nicole Kidman and thought, “Oh well, she works.”
