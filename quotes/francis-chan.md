 - Worry implies that we don’t quite trust God is big enough, powerful enough, or loving enough to take care of what’s happening in our lives.

 - We never grow closer to God when we just live life. It takes deliberate pursuit and attentiveness.

 - Following Christ isn’t something that can be done halfheartedly or on the side. It is not a label we can display when it is useful. It must be central to everything we do and are.

 - If life is a river, then pursuing Christ requires swimming upstream. When we stop swimming, or actively following Him, we automatically begin to be swept downstream.
 - We are each given different gifts and talents by our Master. The thing that matters most is how we use what we have been given, not how much we make or do compared to someone else. What matters is that we spend ourselves.

 - Something is wrong when our lives make sense to unbelievers.
 - God didn’t just give a little for us; He gave His best. He gave Himself.

 - I don’t want my life to be explainable without the Holy Spirit.
 - As I see it, a lukewarm Christian is an oxymoron; there is no such thing. To put it plainly, churchgoers who are ‘lukewarm’ are not Christians. We will not see them in heaven.
 - The way we live out our days is the way we will live our lives.

 - We often think of prayer as a means to an end. Prayer is the goal.
 - Our lack of intimacy is due to our refusal to unplug and shut off communication from all others so we can be alone with Him.
 - When we work for Christ out of obligation, it feels like work. But when we truly love Christ, our work is a manifestation of that love, and it feels like love.
 - Sometimes we shrink from leadership because our pride makes us afraid of failure. That’s not humility.
 - True faith means holding nothing back; it bets everything on the hope of eternity.
 - The God who loans you life sees your every move, hears each word you speak, knows your every thought. You are seen by God. Noticed. Known.
 - The church becomes irrelevant when it becomes purely a human creation. We are not all we were made to be when everything in our lives and churches can be explained apart from the work and presence of the Spirit of God.
 - Lukewarm people will serve God and others, but there are limits to how far they will go or how much time, money, and energy they are willing to give.
 - It is true that God may have called you to be exactly where you are. But, it is absolutely vital to grasp that he didn’t call you there so you could settle in and live your life in comfort and superficial peace.

 - What are you doing right now that requires faith?
 - The greatest knowledge we can ever have is knowing God treasures us.
 - There is nothing better than giving up everything and stepping into a passionate love relationship with God, the God of the universe who made galaxies, leaves, laughter, and me and you.

 - The wise man comes to God without saying a word and stands in awe of Him.
 - I’ve got this amazing relationship with God that is better than life, itself, so marvelous, so wonderful that everything else can fall apart and I’m okay.
 - It’s much less demanding to think about God’s will for your future than it is to ask Him what He wants you to do in the next ten minutes.

 - Making disciples isn’t about gathering pupils to listen to your teaching. The real focus is not on teaching people at all–the focus is on loving them.

 - Only the Holy Spirit can give you the power to not think about yourself, to set you free from yourself.
 - Our lives should be more than just focusing on our marriage but on focusing our marriage toward what God’s mission is for us as a couple.
 - God gave me the same power He gave Jesus. I ask myself daily, Why do I waste such a priceless gift?
 - When we become overly concerned about our appearance, our spiritual reputation, our coolness, and our acceptance, we are living as citizens of this world rather than as ambassadors.
 - People who are obsessed with Jesus give freely and openly without censure. Obsessed people love those who hate them and who can never love them back.
 - God is the only true Giver, and He needs nothing from us. But still He wants us. He gave us life so that we might seek and know Him.
 - Many Spirit-filled authors have exhausted the thesaurus in order to describe God with the glory He deserves. His perfect holiness, by definition, assures us that our words can’t contain Him. Isn’t it a comfort to worship a God we cannot exaggerate?
 - Grace is when you should be totally punished but are blessed for no reason.
 - People accuse me of going overboard preparing for my first ten million years in eternity; in my opinion, people go overboard in worrying about their last ten on earth.
 - Our God listens to us. Our God is a living God. He’s not a block of wood you made up that’s not going to answer you. My God listens to me. He answers me.
 - Luke warm people are continually concerned with playing it safe; they are slaves to the god of control. This focus on safe living keeps them from sacrificing and risking for God.

 - Following Jesus is not about diligently keeping a set of rules or conjuring up the moral fortitude to lead good lives. It’s about loving God and enjoying Him.

 - God has given you this good stuff so that you can show the world a person who enjoys blessings, but who is still totally obsessed with God.

 - People who are obsessed with Jesus aren’t consumed with their personal safety and comfort above all else. Obsessed people care more about God’s kingdom coming to this earth than their own lives being shielded from pain or distress.
 - Whatever God’s reasons for such diversity, creativity, and sophistication in the universe, on earth, and in our own bodies, the point of it all is His glory. God’s art speaks of Himself, reflecting who He is and what He is like.

 - God specifically created us to be like Him. This is impossible to wrap our minds around, but God created us like Him in some respect and then set us in the midst of this world to represent Him!

 - I love being in the ocean. I love the unpredictability of it- size of wave, animals you see, etc.
 - Can you worship a God who isn’t obligated to explain His actions to you? Could it be your arrogance that makes you think God owes you an explanation?
 - God never excuses sin. And He is always consistent with that ethic. Whenever we start to question whether God really hates sin, we have only to think of the cross, where His Son was tortured, mocked, and beaten because of sin. Our sin.
 - Pray with reverence, not half-heartedness.
 - God is the only being who is good, and the standards are set by Him. Because God hates sin, He has to punish those guilty of sin. Maybe that’s not an appealing standard. But to put it bluntly, when you get your own universe, you can make your own standards.
