 - Leap, and the net will appear.
 - Growth is a spiral process, doubling back on itself, reassessing and regrouping.
 - The clock is ticking and you’re hearing the beat. You stop by a museum shop, sign your name on a scuba-diving sheet, and commit yourself to Saturday mornings in the deep end. You’re either losing your mind – or gaining your soul. Life is meant to be an artist date. That’s why we were created.
 - My aspirations are to ennoble Photography and to secure for it the character and uses of High Art by combining the real and Ideal and sacrificing nothing of the Truth by all possible devotion to Poetry and beauty.
 - Beauty, you’re under arrest. I have a camera, and I’m not afraid to use it.
 - What is focus and who has the right to say what focus is the legitimate focus?
 - I longed to arrest all beauty that came before me, and at length the longing has been satisfied.
 - From the first moment I handled my lens with a tender ardour, and it has become to me as a living thing, with voice and memory and creative vigour.
 - When I have had such men before my camera my whole soul has endeavored to do its duty to them in recording faithfully the greatness of the inner as well as the features of the outer man. The photograph thus taken has almost the embodiment of a prayer.
