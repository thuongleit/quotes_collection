 - The old footage of my dad, I always knew we were cut from the same cloth, because my dad was such a renegade and always marched to the beat of his own drum. To see where we were both dancing and being silly together, it’s too beautiful for words. I was really happy to have that.

 - As actors, we want to go find the humanity and make it more nuanced and fill in the colors, rather than just being suit people who crack cases, ’cause they aren’t that.

 - What’s exciting to me is the live show medium itself; it’s the last untouchable medium. I don’t think it will ever go away. It has gone on from the beginning of time with little performances around a campfire, I’d imagine, like cavemen doing some chants, rhythm, and sounds, beating on things.
