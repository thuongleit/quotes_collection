 - During war, the laws are silent.
 - Avoid any specific discussion of public policy at public meetings.
 - Avoid taking a definite stand on great public issues either in the Senate or before the people. Bend your energies towards making friends of key men in all classes of voters.
 - Either the future is subject to chance – in which case nobody, not even a god, can affect it one way or the other – or it is predestined, in which case foreknowledge cannot avert it.
