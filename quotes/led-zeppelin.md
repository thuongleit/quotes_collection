 - Mellow is the man who knows what he’s been missing.
 - Sing loud for the sunshine. Pray hard for the rain.
 - If the sun refused to shine, I’d still be loving you. If mountains crumble to the sea, there will still be you and me.
 - These are the seasons of emotion, and like the winds, they rise and fall.
