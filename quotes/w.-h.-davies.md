 - What is this life if, full of care, we have no time to stand and stare.
 - It was the rainbow gave thee birth, and left thee all her lovely hues.
 - Now shall I walk or shall I ride? ‘Ride,’ Pleasure said; ‘Walk,’ Joy replied.
 - Pleasure’s a Moth, that sleeps by day And dances by false glare at night; But Joy’s a Butterfly, that loves To spread its wings in Nature’s light.
 - When I had money, money, O! I knew no joy till I went poor; For many a false man as a friend Came knocking all day at my door.
 - As long as I love Beauty I am young.
 - I love thee for a heart that’s kind – not for the knowledge in thy mind.
 - But cats to me are strange, so strange I cannot sleep if one is near.
 - No matter where the body is, the mind is free to go elsewhere.
 - Teetotallers lack the sympathy and generosity of men that drink.
 - And hear the pleasant cockoo, loud and long – The simple bird that thinks two notes a song.
