 - It’s not the strongest, but the most adaptable that survive.
 - The most important factor in survival is neither intelligence nor strength but adaptability.
 - It is not the most intellectual of the species that survives; it is not the strongest that survives; but the species that survives is the one that is able best to adapt and adjust to the changing environment in which it finds itself.

 - Even people who aren’t geniuses can outthink the rest of mankind if they develop certain thinking habits.
 - Endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being evolved.

 - There is a grandeur in this view of life, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful are being evolved.
 - The fact of evolution is the backbone of biology, and biology is thus in the peculiar position of being a science founded on an improved theory, is it then a science or faith?
 - If I had life to live over again, I would give my life to poetry, to music, to literature, and to art to make life richer and happier. In my youth I steeled myself against them and thought them so much waste.

 - A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall live and which shall die – which variety or species shall increase in number, and which shall decrease, or finally become extinct.
 - I was a young man with uninformed ideas. I threw out queries, suggestions, wondering all the time over everything; and to my astonishment the ideas took like wildfire. People made a religion of them.
 - Multiply, vary, let the strongest live and the weakest die.
 - My mind seems to have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large collections of facts.
 - The mystery of the beginning of all things is insoluble by us; and I for one must be content to remain an agnostic.
 - To suppose that the eye could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I freely confess, absurd in the highest possible degree.
 - We are not here concerned with hopes or fears, only with truth as far as our reason permits us to discover it.
 - An American monkey, after getting drunk on brandy, would never touch it again, and thus is much wiser than most men.

 - If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin.
 - Our faculties are more fitted to recognize the wonderful structure of a beetle than a Universe.
 - The noble science of Geology loses glory from the extreme imperfection of the record. The crust of the earth with its embedded remains must not be looked at as a well-filled museum, but as a poor collection made at hazard and at rare intervals.
 - In the survival of favoured individuals and races, during the constantly-recurring struggle for existence, we see a powerful and ever-acting form of selection.
 - Linnaeus and Cuvier have been my two gods, though in very different ways, but they were mere schoolboys to old Aristotle.
 - If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no such case.

 - Life is nearly over with me. I have taken no pains about my style of writing.
 - Daily it is forced home on the mind of the biologist that nothing, not even the wind that blows, is so unstable as the level of the crust of this earth.

 - Attention, if sudden and close, graduates into surprise; and this into astonishment; and this into stupefied amazement.
 - You will be astonished to find how the whole mental disposition of your children changes with advancing years. A young child and the same when nearly grown, sometimes differ almost as much as do a caterpillar and butterfly.

 - We have happy days, remember good dinners.
 - I am dying by inches, from not having any body to talk to about insects.
 - Man scans with scrupulous care the character and pedigree of his horses, cattle, and dogs before he matches them; but when he comes to his own marriage he rarely, or never, takes any such care.

 - Delight itself, however, is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist.
 - Many kinds of monkeys have a strong taste for tea, coffee and spirituous liqueurs.
 - Blushing is the most peculiar and most human of all expressions. Monkeys redden from passion but it would take an overwhelming amount of evidence to make us believe that any animal can blush.

 - On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we gain no scientific explanation.
 - The formation of different languages and of distinct species and the proofs that both have been developed through a gradual process, are curiously parallel.
 - From the first dawn of life, all organic beings are found to resemble each other in descending degrees, so that they can be classed in groups under groups. This classification is evidently not arbitrary like the grouping of stars in constellations.

 - Light may be shed on man and his origins.
 - What a book a devil’s chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horribly cruel work of nature!

 - Man tends to increase at a greater rate than his means of subsistence.
 - Believing as I do that man in the distant future will be a far more perfect creature than he now is, it is an intolerable thought that he and all other sentient beings are doomed to complete annihilation after such long-continued slow progress.
 - It is no valid objection that science as yet throws no light on the far higher problem of the essence or origin of life. Who can explain gravity? No one now objects to following out the results consequent on this unknown element of attraction...
 - Whoever is led to believe that species are mutable will do good service by conscientiously expressing his conviction; for only thus can the load of prejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed.
 - May we not suspect that the vague but very real fears of children, which are quite independent of experience, are the inherited effects of real dangers and abject superstitions during ancient savage times?
 - So great is the economy of Nature, that most flowers which are fertilized by crepuscular or nocturnal insects emit their odor chiefly or exculsively in the evening.

 - When I view all beings not as special creations, but as the lineal descendants of some few beings which lived long before the first bed of the Cambrian system was deposited, they seem to me to become ennobled.
 - So in regard to mental qualities, their transmission is manifest in our dogs, horses and other domestic animals. Besides special tastes and habits, general intelligence, courage, bad and good tempers. etc., are certainly transmitted.
 - It struck me that favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones tend to be destroyed.
 - Till facts be grouped and called there can be no prediction. The only advantage of discovering laws is to foretell what will happen and to see the bearing of scattered facts.

 - We are optimists, until we are not.
 - The moral faculties are generally and justly esteemed as of higher value than the intellectual powers.
 - There are several other sources of enjoyment in a long voyage, which are of a more reasonable nature. The map of the world ceases to be a blank; it becomes a picture full of the most varied and animated figures.
 - It is impossible to concieve of this immense and wonderful universe as the result of blind chance or necessity.
 - With highly civilised nations continued progress depends in a subordinate degree on natural selection; for such nations do not supplant and exterminate one another as do savage tribes.
 - I shall always feel respect for every one who has written a book, let it be what it may, for I had no idea of the trouble which trying to write common English could cost one – And alas there yet remains the worst part of all correcting the press.
 - The expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.
 - The young blush much more freely than the old but not during infancy, which is remarkable, as we know that infants at a very early age redden from passion.

 - I think it can be shown that there is such an unerring power at work in Natural Selection, which selects exclusively for the good of each organic being.
 - We fancied even that the bushes smelt unpleasantly.
 - I would give absolutely nothing for the theory of Natural Selection, if it requires miraculous additions at any one stage of descent.
 - It may be doubted whether any character can be named which is distinctive of a race and is constant.
 - In regard to the amount of difference between the races, we must make some allowance for our nice powers of discrimination gained by a long habit of observing ourselves.
 - Although I am fully convinced of the truth of Evolution, I by no means expect to convince experienced naturalists. But I look with confidence to the future naturalists, who will be able to view both sides with impartiality.
