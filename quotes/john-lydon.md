 - I never thought of Green Day as a punk band. Just bubblegum, really.
 - When you come from desperate poverty, and that’s exactly what I come from, you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated. I’m not sure who gains from chaos, but I know it’s not the poor folks in the council flats. The politics of vindictiveness is never, ever anything like a solution.
 - Having a birthday cake squashed into your face by young kids? Delicious. I always don a Santa suit at Christmas. Remaining childish is a tremendous state of innocence.

 - As a young concert-going person, I was never enamoured with celebrities who would walk out to feature in certain songs and then walk off.
 - I’ve never told anyone this. But I suffer from terrible stage fright. True. You can’t tell though, can you? Unbelievable, the panic. I nearly die of fear before I go on stage. Something wicked. I can’t eat a thing the day before a gig. It’d make me vomit.
 - Meat isn’t murder, it’s delicious.
 - You should never, ever be understood completely. That’s like the kiss of death, isn’t it? It’s a full stop. I don’t ever think you should put full stops on thoughts. They change.

 - Freedom isn’t to do what you want at somebody else’s expense.
 - You can’t arrest me, I’m a rockstar.

 - I’ve never said I’m a communist.
 - I love boating – not flash, ‘noisy go fast’ nonsense, but the general relaxation of it. My wife and I love to get in our little Wellcraft and go as far out to sea as we can, hopefully beyond land. That is the best thing you can ever do. It clears your psyche.
 - These days young kids don’t have any place to form an epic adventure. It’s more often in front of the TV screen or a laptop. That’s very hard on them. They’re being taught daily unsocial skills. Facebook is an unsocial skill. It’s so sad.
 - I have values. But morals are Christian. There’s no religion here. Values. Don’t hurt when you don’t need to, but don’t let anybody step over that line – it’s an invisible line, but it’s respect for somebody’s space.

 - I applaud the effort it takes to put a record together.
 - Love is two minutes fifty-two seconds of squishing noises. It shows your mind isn’t clicking right.
 - I’m aware of my songs. I’m aware of them because they’re about true emotions, true feelings, things that matter.

 - I could take on England, but I couldn’t take on one heroin user.

 - Love is 2 minutes and 52 seconds of squelching noises.

 - I’d rather give up my ears than my eyes, which might sound unusual for a musician.
