 - I am not interested in shooting new things – I am interested to see things new.
 - Leica, schmeica. The camera doesn’t make a bit of difference. All of them can record what you are seeing. But you have to see.
 - The camera only facilitates the taking. The photographer must do the giving in order to transform and transcend ordinary reality. The problem is to transform without deforming. He must gain intensity in form and content by bringing a subjective order into an objective chaos.
 - Only a vision – that is what one must have.
 - We can write the new chapters in a visual language whose prose and poetry will need no translation.

 - Don’t ever over-analyze your results. Don’t ever try to find your own secret or the one which you admire. One does not try to catch soap bubbles. One enjoys them in flight and is grateful for their fluid existence.
 - Every work of art has its necessity; find out your very own. Ask yourself if you would do it if nobody would ever see it, if you would never be compensated for it, if nobody ever wanted it. If you come to a clear ‘yes’ in spite of it, then go ahead and don’t doubt it anymore.
