 - I tore the dreams from my head and tossed them in the flames. And the smoke smelled like my past, and it stung my eyes but I was too stubborn to blink.
 - The days blur into one, and the backs of my eyes hum with things I’ve never done.
 - Everybody’s bones are just holy branches cast from trees to cut patterns in the world. And in time we find some shelter, spill our leaves, and then sleep in the earth. And when we’re there, we’ll belong, ’cause the earth don’t give a damn if you’re lost.
