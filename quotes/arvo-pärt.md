 - Silence is the pause in me when I am near to God.
 - The human voice is the most perfect instrument of all.
 - Tintinnabulation is an area I sometimes wander into when I am searching for answers â€“ in my life, my music, my work. In my dark hours, I have the certain feeling that everything outside this one thing has no meaning.
 - Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I am alone with silence. I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence comfort me.

 - A need to concentrate on each sound, so that every blade of grass would be as important as a flower.
