 - Eliminating one weakness is better than adding one strength.
 - Originally this was the most important thing about martial arts – to reach a higher level, to become a strong human being. Strong doesn’t mean big arms. It means who can be a more strict human being with himself. That is the ideal of martial arts.
 - We must look at ourselves with the strictest eyes.
