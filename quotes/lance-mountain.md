 - Skateboarding doesn’t make you a skateboarder; not being able to stop skateboarding makes you a skateboarder.
 - I was a real skateboarder, not a gifted skateboarder. I represented that skateboarding was fun to do by being terrible at it.
 - Skateboarding has nothing to do with competition or sport. It has to do with trying to stay as immature as you can for the rest of your life. It’s kind of a lame thing to say, but it really is.
 - I feel like I’ve influenced in the sense that if you want to do it, do it. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it. But don’t rely on what people are saying you can do or saying what you can’t do.
