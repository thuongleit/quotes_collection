 - Time goes by slowly when you spend it waiting.
 - One often meets her destiny on the road she takes to avoid it.
 - I’ve got this tiny pang of regret when I think of how much I have probably missed out on in the last few years because I was too scared to take a risk, or too shy to speak up, or too worried to be bold.
 - Sometimes a shock to the system is a good thing, you know? Like a reminder that you’re alive.
 - We’re all more than the person we show to everyone else.
 - But sometimes life gives us those rare moments where we do see chance as it’s happening. And in those moments, we have a choice. And sometimes we have to take a risk. And it’s scary. It makes us vulnerable. But I know now it’s worth it.
 - Nothing could be left to chance, because chance, after all, can be dangerous. But what I didn’t realize all that time, what I missed all along, is that chance is everywhere. It’s also what life is made of. It’s all around us, but most of the time we never see it working.
 - I read once that water is a symbol for emotions. And for a while now I’ve thought maybe my mother drowned in both.
 - But what I realize, here, now, is that it’s not actually making the choice that takes courage. It’s facing it afterward. Owning up to it, whether it’s good or bad.
 - That’s the best part. The how.
 - It seems to me that the experiences that stay with you, the things you’ll always remember, aren’t the ones you can force, or go looking for. I’ve always thought of those things as the ones that somehow find you.
 - We’re all more than the person we show to everyone else. At least I hope so. Because I feel like there’s more to me than that. I just haven’t had the chance yet to show it.
 - That’s what seems the most sad to me – that neither of them even think there’s a possibility they can be together.
 - But when’s the last time you took a chance? Or didn’t do what someone else expected of you? Or did something you really wanted to, even though you probably shouldn’t have?
