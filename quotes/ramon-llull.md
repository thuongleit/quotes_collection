 - Without producing, no man can love, nor can he understand or remember, nor have the power of feeling and being.
 - He who loves not lives not.
 - If understanding followed no rule at all, there would be no good in the understanding nor in the matter understood, and to remain in ignorance would be the greatest good.
 - Death has no terrors for a sincere servant of Christ who is laboring to bring souls to a knowledge of the truth.
