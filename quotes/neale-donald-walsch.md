 - Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.
 - Your thoughts create your reality. Your mind is more powerful than you know.

 - You make your Own luck.
 - The struggle ends when gratitude begins.
 - Gratitude in advance is the most powerful creative force in the universe.
 - Enjoy everything. Need nothing.
 - Quantum physics tells us that nothing that is observed is unaffected by the observer. That statement, from science, holds an enormous and powerful insight. It means that everyone sees a different truth because everyone is creating what they see.
 - If you want the best the world has to offer, offer the world your best.
 - If you don’t go within, you go without.
 - Your world will follow your idea about yourself.
 - Life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. What you believe about Life will be your experience of Life.
 - Remember, you are constantly in the act of creating yourself. You are in every moment deciding who and what you are. You decide this largely through the choices you make regarding who and what you feel passionate about.
 - There is nothing you cannot be, there is nothing you cannot do. There is nothing you cannot have.
 - The universe is just a big Xerox machine. It simply produces copies of your thoughts.
 - Nothing stays the same, nothing remains static. Which way a thing changes depends on you.
 - The moment you surrender to love and allow it to lead you to exactly where your soul wants to go, you will have no difficulty.
 - Happiness is a decision, not an experience. You can decide to be happy without what you thought you needed in order to be happy, and you will be. Your experience is the result of your decision, not the cause of it.
 - The way to move out of judgement is to move into gratitude.
 - Every decision you make – every decision that you make every second – is not a decision about what to do, it is a decision about who you are. Every act is an act of self-definition.
 - I have sent you nothing but angels.
 - Do not wonder why things are “taking so long.” In fact, everything is rolling out exactly as it needs to, using not a minute more than Perfection requires. Rest easy and be at peace. Life is working its magic even as you take your very next breath.
 - Life begin at the end of your Comfort Zone. So if you’re feeling uncomfortable right now, know that the change taking place in your life is a begining, not an ending.
 - Life is a creation, not a discovery.
 - Singing connects the mind with the heart and the heart with the soul. So sing. I dare you!
 - Fear is energy which contracts, closes down, draws in, runs, hides, hoards, harms. Love is the energy which expands, opens up, sends out, stays, reveals, shares, HEALS.
 - Do not jump into reaction mode at the first appearance of negative energy. Just breathe, and relax.
 - True vision is the ability to see in another more than they are showing you.
 - The soul creates, the mind reacts. The soul understands what the mind cannot conceive.
 - The laws are very simple: thought is creative; fear attracts like energy; love is all there is.
 - Don’t dismiss the synchronicity of what is happening right now finding its way to your life at just this moment. There are no coincidences in the universe, only convergences of Will, Intent, and Experience.
 - A five-word sentence that could change the world tomorrow is What would love do now?
 - The correct prayer is never one of supplication but one of gratitude.
 - I tell you this: There is no coincidence, and nothing happens “by accident.” Each event and adventure is called to your Self by your Self in order that you might create and experience Who You Really Are.
 - What you resist persists. And only what you look at, and own, can disappear. You make it disappear by simply changing your mind about it.
 - Your soul doesn’t care what you do for a living – and when your life is over, neither will you. Your soul cares only about what you are being while you are doing whatever you are doing.
 - There is only one reason to do anything: as a statement to the universe of Who You Are.
 - You cannot change the outer event, so you must change the inner experience.
 - In order to experience the Ultimate Reality you have to be out of your mind.
 - So long as you are still worried about what others think of you, you are owned by them. Only when you require no approval from outside yourself can you own yourself.
 - Remain grateful for every outcome. Every outcome. Gratitude is the connecting energy to God.
 - The purpose of life is to create your Self anew, in the next grandest version of the greatest vision ever you held about Who You Are. It is to announce and become, express and fulfill, experience and know your true Self.
 - Remember always, you are the gift!
 - Every act is an act of self definition.
 - You are afraid to die, and you’re afraid to live. What a way to exist.
 - It is not for you to judge the journey of another’s soul. It is for you to decide who YOU are, not who another has been or has failed to be.
 - Focus your mind on what your Highest Self chooses to be.
 - If you want to create abundance for yourself, create it for someone else.
 - All change in life comes from within. It is what’s in humanity’s soul, not what’s in humanity’s wallet, that will purchase our freedom from humanity’s suffering.
 - If you want guarantees in life, then you don’t want life. You want rehearsals for a script that’s already been written. Life by its nature cannot have guarantees, or its whole purpose is thwarted.
 - Give everyone whose life you touch a sense of their own worthiness as a person, a sense of the true wonder of who they are. Give this gift and you will heal the world.
 - The deepest secret is that life is not a process of discovery, but a process of creation. You are not discovering yourself, but creating yourself anew. Seek therefore, not to find out Who You Are, but seek to determine Who You Want to Be.
 - To live your life without expectation-without the need for specific results-that is freedom. That is Godliness.
 - Fear and guilt are your only enemies. If you let go of fear, fear lets go of you. If you release guilt, guilt will release you. How do you do that? By deciding to.
 - The purpose of meditation is to create focus. It is about focusing your attention on your experience. The reason for focus: it allows you to be here now. Your only reality is This Moment, right here, right now. Peace is found in such awareness.
 - Health will improve almost at once when worrying ends.
 - There is a divine purpose behind everything – and therefore a divine presence in everything.
 - Go ahead and do what you really love to do! Do nothing else! You have so little time. How can you think of wasting a moment doing something for a living you don’t like to do? What kind of a living is that? That is not a living, that is a dying!
 - True masters are those who’ve chosen to make a life rather than a living.
 - The biggest commitment you must keep is your commitment to yourself.
 - If you cannot find a group whose consciousness matches your own, be the source of one. Others of like consciousness will be drawn to you.
 - Glorify who you are today, do not condemn who you were yesterday, and dream of who you can be tomorrow.
 - Never deny passion, for that is to deny Who You Are, and Who You Truly Want To Be.
 - When you find peace within, you also find that you can do without. This means simply that you no longer need the things of your outside world, and not needing is a great freedom.
 - When you come from ‘love,’ you do certain things because you are love, not because you want to have love.
 - Gratitude is the miracle cure for every moment of dis-ease.
 - The question ‘Who am I?’ is not an idle one. How you answer the question will determine how you live the rest of your life. It will determine the quality of your life.
 - Keep moving. Don’t stop. But don’t rush. Don’t race around. Sure and steady gets you there every time.
 - There is enough to go around. Lack of the will to share is the problem, not lack of the stuff to share.
 - Say your truth-kindly, but fully and completely. Live your truth, gently, but totally and consistently. Change your truth easily and quickly when your experience brings you new clarity.
 - All things lead us to our innermost truth. That is their purpose. That is the purpose of Life itself. Life is truth, revealing Itself to Itself.
 - To have a friendship with God, all I really have to do is have a friendship with my Self.
 - If you’re going to do something, do it with gusto. Don’t do anything half-heartedly. That dishonors the doing and the doer. So go for it. Hold nothing back. In life. Or love. Or anything at all!
 - Your whole life is a message. Every act is an act of self-definition. Everything you think, say and do sends a message about you.
 - What’s happening is merely what’s happening. How you feel about it is another matter.
 - Honor your body. Keep it in good shape. It is the most important physical tool that you have. Exercise is the meditation of the body. It allows you to feel Oneness with all of Life.
 - Even our most difficult moments bring us gifts. The trick, of course, is gratitude. Therein will you find both your peace and your joy.
 - The only thing that changes as we evolve is the idea of what serves us.
 - A true leader is not the one with the most followers, but one who creates the most leaders.
 - A life lived of choice is a life of conscious action. A life lived of chance is a life of unconscious creation.
 - Open your mind, allow your feelings to be expressed, to be pushed out, and your heart will neither break nor burst, but be a free-flowing channel of the life energy in your soul.
 - If you don’t like the way you are headed, change direction. Go inside. Search your place of inner wisdom. See what this calls on you to do. Then do it.
 - All of life is an announcement of who we are. The only question is whether this proclamation will be made by choice or by chance.
 - The reason people don’t know what is good for them is because most people don’t know what they are trying to do.
 - I tell you this: Your Life proceeds out of your intentions for it.
 - Nothing changes the environment like one person deciding to love another, no matter what.
 - Nothing substitutes for positive thinking. Nothing. It is more powerful than all the money, all the influence, all the ‘friends in high places’ on earth.
 - Love can be sent to others in a thousand ways. Even thoughts of love can change things. They can be felt. By you, and by the person you are thinking of, too. Yes, they can. Help others by by loving them, simply, plainly, openly, without condition.
 - The way to reduce the pain which you associate with earthly experiences and events-both yours and those of others-is to change the way you behold them.
 - Ignore your previous experience and go into the moment. Be Here Now. See what there is to work with right now in creating yourself anew. Life is an ongoing, never-ending process of re-creation.
 - Worry, hate, fear-together with their offshoots: anxiety, bitterness, impatience, avarice, unkindness, judgmentalness, and condemnation-all attack the body at the cellular level. It is impossible to have a healthy body under these conditions.
 - The point of life is not to get anywhere-it is to notice that you are, and have always been, already there.
 - Your happy destiny is unavoidable.
 - When we understand the best way to achieve all our goals is to assist others in achieving their goals, we will find the key to lasting happiness.
 - Social evolution is demonstrated by movement towards unity, not separatism.
 - Life is eternal. You are immortal. You never do die. You simply change form.
 - The era of the Single Savior is over. What is needed now is joint action, combined effort, collective co-creation.
 - The goal is to help the weak grow strong, not to let the weak become weaker.
 - When you have an unconditional love of Life, then you love Life just the way it is showing up, right here, right now. This is only possible when you are “seeing the perfection.”
 - Happiness is allowing yourself to be okay with what is, rather than wishing for, and bemoaning, what is not. Obviously, what is is what is supposed to be, or it would not be. The rest is just you, arguing with life.
 - Teach not with your words, but with your actions; not with discussion but with demonstration. For it is what you do that your children will emulate, and how you are that they will become.
 - The Roman Catholics teach that unless you’re a Roman Catholic you do not go to heaven.
 - Enlightenment is understanding that there is nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody you have to be except exactly who you’re being right now.

 - Know and understand that there will be challenges and difficult times. Don’t try to avoid them. Welcome them. Gratefully.
 - Everything is falling together perfectly, even though it looks as if some things are falling apart. Trust in the process you are now experiencing.
 - If you think God looks only one way or sounds only one way or is only one way, you’re going to look right past Me night and day. You’ll spend your whole life looking for God and not finding Her. Because you’re looking for a Him.
 - Trust in the process you are now experiencing. Life is on your side. It is showing that to you now, though you may not be able to see it clearly at this time.
 - I tell you this: The purpose of life is not to please God. The purpose of life is to know, and to recreate, Who You Are.
 - There is no truth except the truth that exists within you. Everything else is what someone is telling you.
 - You are always connected to Source. Wherever you are, wherever you go, you are always connected to Divine Wisdom, Divine Intelligence, and Divine Love.
 - You are living in a dream of your own creation. Let it be the dream of a lifetime, for that is exactly what it is.
 - Nothing has done more to separate and divide human beings one from another than exclusivist organized religion.
 - One either has to believe in a God who’s terribly prejudiced, or disbelieve the teachings of such exclusionary theologies. Religions have taught us that ‘we are better than they.’
 - If you believe the noises of the world, rather than the silences of your soul, you will be lost.
 - Disappointment is temporary. Only your thought about it is permanent. Change your mind about what has disappointed you and you will change your life.
 - All learning is remembering. A good teacher causes students to remember what they already know.

 - Until you can let go of everything, you will find it hard to hold onto anything.
 - Instead of seeking to pinpoint blame, seek to understand cause.
 - Freedom is the basic concept and construct of life everywhere, because freedom is the basic nature of God. All systems which reduce, restrict, impinge upon or eliminate freedom in any way are systems which work against life itself.
 - The moment you proclaim your Oneness with God, others will proclaim you partnership with Satan.
 - Everything changes when you make a decision to be one of the courageous ones, someone who chooses to make a life, rather than a living.

 - And if we’re all one, we need to stop our competition with each other. Most of the decisions we make are about survival and winning.
 - Speak your truth but soothe your words with peace.
 - Let your love propel your beloveds into the world-and into the full experience of who they are. In this will you have truly loved.
 - Envy not success, nor pity failure, for you know not what is success or failure in the soul’s reckoning.
 - Teach your children that they need nothing exterior to themselves to be happy, no person, place or thing, and that true happiness is found within.
 - Love lets go. Need holds on. This is the way you can tell the difference between need and love. Let go of expectation, let go of requirements and rules and regulations that you would impose on your loved ones.
 - It is not God’s function to create or uncreate the circumstances of your life. God created You, in the image and likeness of God. You have created the rest.
 - Thought, word, and deed are the three levels of creation.
 - There are only two energies at the core of the human experience: love and fear. Love grants freedom, fear takes it away. Love invites full expression, fear punishes it. Love invites you, always, to break the bonds of ignorance.
 - Be a bringer of the Light. For your light can do more than illuminate your own path, you can be the light which truly lights the world.
 - The purpose of life is to know yourself, create yourself, experience yourself as Who You Really Are. There is no other reason to do anything.
 - There are no victims in the universe, only creators. The Masters who have walked this planet all knew this.
 - Thought is pure energy. Every thought you have, have ever had, and ever will have is creative. The energy of your thought never dies. Ever. It leaves your being and heads out into the universe, extending forever. A thought is forever.
 - As you shift and change your own experience, the experience of the whole human race begins to shift and change as well. So this is important work you are doing, this business of changing your life.
 - When you find inner peace, neither the presence nor absence of any person, place or thing, condition, circumstance, or situation can be the Creator of your state of mind or the cause of your experience of being.
 - Choose, but don’t want.
 - Grant yourself permission to have all that life has to offer, and you will discover it has more to offer than you’ve ever imagined.
 - The soul – your soul – knows all there is to know all the time. There’s nothing hidden to it, nothing unknown. Yet knowing is not enough. The soul seeks to experience.
 - Forget about the past. It does not exist, except in your memory. Drop it. And stop worrying about how you’re going to get through tomorrow. Life is going on right here, right now – pay attention to that and all will be well.
 - Smiling can be a deliberate, intentioned act. When it is that, it becomes an act of creation, and a powerful tool. Be quick to smile, and quick to share your smile with others. You will light up your heart and light up the room.
 - Healing is the process of accepting all, then choosing best.
 - You can only succeed. You cannot fail. Failure is impossible; it is an illusion. Nothing is a failure. Nothing. Everything moves the human story, and hence the process of evolution, forward. Everything advances you on your journey.
 - You are your own highest authority. Do not place your source of authority outside of you. Go within to see if the truth you’ve found is in harmony with the truth you find in your heart.
 - All that is required is to know this. For you are the creator of your reality, and life can show up no other way for you than that way in which you think it will.
 - All great truths begin as blasphemy. Every single revolutionary idea that has ever been visited upon the human experience began as an idea which was rejected.
 - A good cry can be wonderful sometimes, and sadness is nothing more than love announced. Sadness and Unhappiness are not the same thing, and it is good to remember that. And there is this: sadness cleanses the heart.
 - If only you knew all the gifts that you bring to others. You would never feel sad again.
 - That’s the problem with truth. The truth is relentless. It won’t leave you alone. It keeps creeping up on you from every side, showing you what’s really so. That can he annoying.

 - Life is an ongoing, never-ending process of re-creation.
 - Consider the possibility that the little obstacles in life are not obstacles at all, but stepping stones.
 - Fear and caution are two different things. Be cautious – be conscious – but do not be fearful. Fear only paralyzes, while consciousness mobilizes. Be mobilized, not paralyzed.
 - You cannot let go of anything if you cannot notice that you are holding it. Admit your ‘weaknesses’ and watch them morph into your greatest strengths.
 - You cannot know God until you’ve stopped telling yourself that you already know God. You cannot hear God until you stop thinking that you’ve already heard God. I cannot tell you My Truth until you stop telling Me yours.
 - This is the great secret. This is the sacred wisdom. Do unto others as you would have it done unto you.
 - It is you who are choosing, in any moment, to be happy or choosing to be sad, or choosing to be angry, or forgiving, or enlightened, or whatever. You are choosing.
 - Creation is the highest form of Divinity, and your birthright. Truth is, you are creating all the time. The central question in your life is whether you are doing this consciously or unconsciously.
 - Only humans are judgmental, and because you are, you assume that I must be. Yet I am not, and that is the great truth you cannot accept.
 - Because we believe that our ethnic group, our society, our political party, our God, is better than your God, we kill each other.
 - Now, having seen the differences between where you are and where you want to be, begin to change-consciously change-your thoughts, words, and actions to match your grandest vision.

 - Life was meant to be happy.
 - And because we are, somehow, better than they, we get to go to heaven and they don’t. Christians will tell you outright that they believe that.
 - There are thousands of paths to God and every one gets you there.
 - The mind and the soul must work together if you are to experience true bliss. Try not to spend too much time exclusively in your mind. It is a magnificent tool, but it has a limited perspective.
 - As told in Friendship with God, if we simply decided to believe and act as if first, we’re all one, and second, life is eternal, it would render virtually everything we’ve done all our lives pointless.
 - Your happy destiny is unavoidable. You cannot be “saved.” There is no hell except not knowing this.
 - The Ultimate Reality is that everything you think you need, you already have. It exists inside of you. Indeed, it is you. You are what you need – and therefore, you give yourself everything you need in any given moment.
 - Forever is longer than you know. Eternal is longer than Forever. God is more than you imagine. God is the energy you call imagination. God is creation. God is first thought. And God is last experience. And God is everything in between.
 - When you understand that you are your soul, then you will experience Life as an expression of the soul.
 - Do not dismantle the house, but look at each brick, and replace those which appear to be broken, which no longer support the structure.

 - I am telling you that your perception of ultimate reality is more limited than you thought, and that Truth is more unlimited than you can imagine.
 - For it is the nature of people to love, then destroy, then love again that which they value most.
 - Life begins now – right now – not tomorrow or the next day or the next. Every minute of every hour of every day, life begins anew. That means everything can change in an instant. It also means you can have a new beginning whenever you want.
 - Know that all times are Holy, that every religion holds truth, that each tradition is sacred, and that it is in the simple sharing of love that we make our beliefs come alive, and our dreams come true.
 - Some things will always remain a mystery at this level of consciousness, and it is right that they should. So do not try to solve all the mysteries. Give the universe a chance. It will unfold itself in due course. Enjoy the experience of becoming.
 - Nothing in this world is real.
 - Fear and guilt are your only enemies. Love and awareness are your true friends. Do not confuse one with the other, for one will kill you, while the other gives you life.
 - The soul conceives, the mind creates, the body experiences. The circle is complete.

 - Feelings are sometimes difficult to discover, and often even more difficult to acknowledge. Yet hidden in your deepest feelings is your highest truth.
 - There is no free will if to exercise it in certain ways produces punishment. That makes a mockery of free will and renders it counterfeit.
 - You can’t lose the game. You can’t go wrong. It’s not part of the plan. There is no way not to get where you are going. There’s no way to miss your destination. If God is your target, you’re in luck, because God is so big, you can’t miss.
 - You must learn to honor and cherish and love your Self. You must first see your Self as worthy before you can see another as worthy. You must first know your Self to be holy before you can acknowledge holiness in another.

 - There are those who say that seeing is believing. I am telling you that believing is seeing.
 - Life can show up no other way than that way in which you perceive it.
 - Hell is the opposite of joy. It is unfulfillment. It is knowing Who and What You Are, and failing to experience that. It is being less.
 - Fear wraps our bodies in clothing, love allows us to stand naked.
 - When you give your children knowledge, you are telling them what to think. When you give your children wisdom, you do not tell them what to know, or what is true, but rather, how to get to their own truth.
 - Never, ever, ever think that your life is over, but know always that each day, each hour, each moment is another beginning, another opportunity, another chance to re-create yourself anew.

 - The more that you act on your intuition fearlessly, the more your intuition will serve you. Intuition is the ear of the soul.
