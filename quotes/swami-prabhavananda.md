 - There is no failure in the spiritual life, as long as we do not give up the fight.
 - The breeze of Godâ€™s grace is blowing continually. You have to set your sail to catch that breeze.
 - The way upward from inertia to illumination passes through the sphere of action.
 - The fulfillment of every desire only reveals its inadequacy.
