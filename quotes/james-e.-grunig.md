 - Public Relations is the management of communication between an organization and its publics.
 - We believe PR should be practiced to serve the public interest, to develop mutual understanding between organizations and their publics.
 - The main reason to measure objectives is not so much to reward or punish individual communications manager for success or failure as it is to learn from the research whether a program should be continued as is, revised, or dropped in favor of another approach.
