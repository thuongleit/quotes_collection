 - Your world is as big as you make it.
 - Rise with the hour for which you were made.
 - I want to die while you love me, While yet you hold me fair, While laughter lies upon my lips, And lights are in my hair.
 - Is there not a way by which the man who can think can be enabled to have time to think?
 - The strong demand, contend, prevail; the beggar is a fool.
