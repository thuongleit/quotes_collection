 - Every victory of Hezbollah, I celebrate.
 - It’s utterly hypocritical for Israelis to wonder aloud why Palestinians don’t pursue a non-violent strategy. One obvious reason is that, whenever they have, Israel brutally represses it.
 - They used to say Palestinians fight like heroes, now they say heroes fight like Palestinians.
 - The Holocaust industry has always been bankrupt. What remains is to openly declare it so. The time is long past to put it out of business.
 - Why should these Palestinians, who have lived in Jerusalem for hundreds of years, be evicted from their homes so that Jews from Brooklyn can live in them?
 - Given the nonsense that is turned out daily by the Holocaust industry, the wonder is that there are so few skeptics.
 - International law says people fighting for self-determination can use force in order to achieve their independence.
 - I focus on my work. If I let myself get distracted by the insults and slanders I wouldn’t get anything substantive done.
 - There is no way a non-Jew could say what I did in ‘The Holocaust Industry’ without being labelled a Holocaust denier. I am labelled a Holocaust denier, too.
 - Judging by opinion polls, Israel has bigger problems than me. It is among the most hated countries on the planet. It should stop acting like a lunatic state. Once it carries on like a normal country, I will be happily redirect my energies elsewhere.
 - I’m politically on the left, no question about it. I oppose sweatshops, I oppose exploitation of labour in the third world.
 - The Holocaust only emerged in American life after Israel’s victory in the 1967 Six Day war against its Arab neighbours.
 - There’s nothing Israel can do without US support. It can’t breathe without US support. The US bankrolls everything, and it’s just silly to think that Israel can do anything without the support.
 - War is not a means to an end, it is the end, whereas politics is merely the hiatus between wars.
 - When I was a young man, my mother said to me, ‘You can’t be a communist without being a militant atheist.’ So I had to be a militant atheist because I wanted to be a communist.
 - Everybody wants peace. That’s a truism. There is no point in accomplishing through war what you can accomplish through peace.

 - Israel has come out of the boils of the hell, a satanic state.
 - Indeed, the field of Holocaust studies is replete with nonsense if not sheer fraud.
 - There is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and people have the right to defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary, and uncomplicated question.
 - I don’t feel particularly attached to Israel – ‘nationalism,’ as Noam Chomsky said, ‘is not my cup of tea’ – but I feel no particular need to demonize it.
 - People are motivated by the desires for privilege, for power, for profit. Those are not shocking revelations. Anyone who’s had any experience in life knows these things.

 - You know, frankly speaking, money just doesn’t figure largely in my world view.

 - Insofar as Zionism sought to solve the Jewish question, it must be reckoned not just a failure but a catastrophe: Israel is the main cause of anti-Semitism in the world today.
 - Apart from my parents, every family member on both sides was exterminated by the Nazis.
 - Goldstone has done terrible damage to the cause of truth and justice and the rule of law. He has poisoned Jewish-Palestinian relations, undermined the courageous work of Israeli dissenters and-most unforgivably-increased the risk of another merciless IDF assault.
 - My parents often wondered why I would grow so indignant at the falsification and exploitation of the Nazi genocide. The most obvious answer is that it has been used to justify criminal policies of the Israeli state and US support for these policies.
