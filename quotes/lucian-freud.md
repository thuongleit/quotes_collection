 - The longer you look at an object, the more abstract it becomes, and, ironically, the more real.
 - I have a timetable, but no routine.
 - I could never put anything into a picture that wasn’t actually there in front of me. That would be a pointless lie, a mere bit of artfulness.
 - It is the only point of getting up every morning: to paint, to make something good, to make something even better than before, not to give up, to compete, to be ambitious.
 - Full, saturated colours have an emotional significance I want to avoid.
 - The aura given out by a person or object is as much a part of them as their flesh.
 - I would wish my portraits to be of the people, not like them. Not having a look of the sitter, being them.

 - The process of creation becomes necessary to the painter perhaps more than is the picture. The process in fact is habit-forming.
 - I have a hatred of habit and routine. And what dogs love is just that. They like regular everything, and I don’t have regular anything. I have a timetable, but no routine.
