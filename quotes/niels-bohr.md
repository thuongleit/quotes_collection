 - There are some things so serious you have to laugh at them.
 - When searching for harmony in life one must never forget that in the drama of existence we are ourselves both actors and spectators.

 - It is the hallmark of any deep truth that its negation is also a deep truth.
 - Your theory is crazy, but it’s not crazy enough to be true.
 - A person who wasn’t outraged on first hearing about quantum theory didn’t understand what had been said.
 - What is that we human beings ultimately depend on? We depend on our words. We are suspended in language. Our task is to communicate experience and ideas to others.
 - Accuracy and clarity of statement are mutually exclusive.
 - Address to Albert Einstein: You are not thinking. You are merely being logical.

 - We are trapped by language to such a degree that every attempt to formulate insight is a play on words.
 - Those who are not shocked when they first come across quantum theory cannot possibly have understood it.
 - Every sentence I utter must be understood not as an affirmation, but as a question.
 - The present state of atomic theory is characterized by the fact that we not only believe the existence of atoms to be proved beyond a doubt, but also we even believe that we have an intimate knowledge of the constituents of the individual atoms.
 - The meaning of life consists in the fact that it makes no sense to say that life has no meaning.
 - Isolated material particles are abstractions, their properties being definable and observable only through their interaction with other systems .

 - Some subjects are so serious that one can only joke about them.
 - Sometimes the child in one behaves a certain way and the rest of oneself follows behind, slowly shaking its head.

 - Our task is not to penetrate the essence of things, the meaning of which we do not know anyway, but rather to develop concepts which allow us to talk in a productive way about phenomena in nature.
 - When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.
 - It is, indeed, perhaps the greatest prospect of humanistic studies to contribute through an increasing knowledge of the history of cultural development to that gradual removal of prejudices which is the common aim of all science.
 - If you think you understand it, that only shows that you don’t know the first thing about it.
 - In our description of nature the purpose is not to disclose the real essence of the phenomena but only to track down, so far as it is possible, relations between the manifold aspects of our experience.
 - It is a great pity that human beings cannot find all of their satisfaction in scientific contemplativeness.
 - It is wrong to think that the task of physics is to find out how Nature is. Physics concerns what we say about Nature.
 - You must come to Copenhagen to work with us. We like people who can actually perform thought experiments!
 - There is no hope for any speculation that does not look absurd at first glance.
 - An independant reality in the ordinary physical sense can neither be ascribed to the phenomenon nor to the agencies of observation.
 - There are two sorts of truth: trivialities, where opposites are clearly absurd, and profound truths, recognised by the fact that the opposite is also a profound truth.

 - If an idea does not appear bizarre, there is no hope for it.
 - The great extension of our experience in recent years has brought light to the insufficiency of our simple mechanical conceptions and, as a consequence, has shaken the foundation on which the customary interpretation of observation was based.
