 - Physical geography and geology are inseparable scientific twins.
 - During cycles long anterior to the creation of the human race, and while the surface of the globe was passing from one condition to another, whole races of animals-each group adapted to the physical conditions in which they lived-were successively created and exterminated.
 - We should greatly err, if we endeavoured to force all ancient nature into a close comparison with existing operations.
