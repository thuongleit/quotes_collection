 - Credibility, like virginity, can only be lost once and never recovered.

 - Don’t live beyond your means. Don’t buy more than you can pay for. Don’t expect to get rich quick. And don’t confuse salesmen for friends or advisers.
 - Americans, both politicians and voters, may have become corrupted by big government beyond redemption. A virtuous government requires a virtuous people. A frugal government requires a self-reliant people. A free country requires people who value liberty more than money.
 - The truth is that neither British nor American imperialism was or is idealistic. It has always been driven by economic or strategic interests.
 - Reason and truth have rarely prevailed against demagoguery when the audience is too ignorant to tell the difference.

 - A nation dies culturally and spiritually first. Its money and its army are the last to go, but go they do once the light goes out in the nation’s soul.
 - People who believe in gun control are ignorant, superstitious or stupid.
 - If we could manage our own finances the way the Congress does the nation’s, we’d all be living in high cotton and eating high on the hog.
 - The new laws passed by Congress in the name of fighting terrorism pose a greater danger to the civil liberties of American citizens than to the operations of terrorists. Powers once assumed are never relinquished, just as bureaucracies, once created, never die.
 - Crime is a human behavior problem, not a mechanical problem. Furthermore, if firearms were not very useful for self-defense, then police wouldn’t carry them. In a free country, if the government can go armed, so should the citizens, if they so choose.

 - Government is inherently incompetent, and no matter what task it is assigned, it will do it in the most expensive and inefficient way possible.
