 - I think that Capitalism, wisely managed, can probably be made more efficient for attaining economic ends than any alternative system yet in sight, but that in itself is in many ways extremely objectionable.
 - Investment based on genuine long-term expectations is so difficult today as to be scarcely practicable.
