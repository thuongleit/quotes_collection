 - All of us as human beings are connected by one energy and consciousness. So we all affect each other and everything that’s happening in the world affects us individually. And what we’re each doing as an individual affects what’s going on in the world.
 - Whatever our individual troubles and challenges may be, it’s important to pause every now and then to appreciate all that we have, on every level. We need to literally ‘count our blessings,’ give thanks for them, allow ourselves to enjoy them, and relish the experience of prosperity we already have.

 - The people we are in relationships with are always a mirror, reflecting our own beliefs, and simultaneously we are mirrors, reflecting their beliefs.

 - In the Western world there isn’t much value given to the necessity for just being quiet. And just resting, and just being, without a focus or a goal.
