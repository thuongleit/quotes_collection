 - In Buddhism, compassion always goes with wisdom. Compassion without wisdom is not understood to be true compassion, and wisdom without compassion is not true wisdom.
 - Emptiness is not a mere emptiness, but rather fullness in which the distinctiveness of everything is throughly realized.
 - When Death puts out our Flame, the Snuff will tell, If we were Wax, or Tallow by the smell.
