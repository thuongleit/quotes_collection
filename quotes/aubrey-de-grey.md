 - There is no difference between saving lives and extending lives, because in both cases we are giving people the chance of more life.
 - In the eye, there is a type of junk that accumulates in the back of the retina that eventually causes us to go blind. It’s called age-related macular degeneration.
 - It’s not just about life, of course; it’s about healthy life. Getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun, whether or not dying may be fun.
 - If changing our world is playing God, it is just one more way in which God made us in His image.
 - The right to choose to live or to die is the most fundamental right there is; conversely, the duty to give others that opportunity to the best of our ability is the most fundamental duty there is.
 - Theres nothing wrong with making the best of ones declining years, but what does annoy me is the fatalism. Now that were seriously in range of finding therapies that actually work against ageing, this apathy, of course, becomes an enormous part of the problem.
 - If you look at winners of the Nobel Prize in biology, you’ll find a fair smattering of people who don’t know how to work a pipette.
 - I don’t work on longevity, I work on keeping people healthy.
 - Basically, the body does have a vast amount of inbuilt anti-ageing machinery; it’s just not 100% comprehensive, so it allows a small number of different types of molecular and cellular damage to happen and accumulate.
 - The biggest handicap in research is an ability to think outside the box. The handicap is being encumbered by all the conventional wisdom in a given field.
 - Accept the difficulty of what you cannot yet change. But do not accept the impossibility of ever changing it.
 - I’m the chief science officer of a foundation that works on the application of regenerative medicine to the problem of aging.
 - Some things tend not to work so well for science – things that rely on substantial written contributions by key experts are a case in point – but even there I tend to keep an open mind, because it may just be a case of finding the right formula.
 - My approach is to start from the straightforward principle that our body is a machine. A very complicated machine, but none the less a machine, and it can be subjected to maintenance and repair in the same way as a simple machine, like a car.

 - Public enthusiasm for new advances is a key ingredient in influencing policy-makers to stimulate follow-up work with suitable funding, and it can be achieved far faster now that interested non-specialists can explore new research autonomously and can also be appealed to directly by scientists.
 - I think it’s reasonable to suppose that one could oscillate between being biologically 20 and biologically 25 indefinitely.
 - Wikipedia was a big help for science, especially science communication, and it shows no sign of diminishing in importance.
 - What I’m after is not living to 1,000. I’m after letting people avoid death for as long as they want to.
 - What I actually wanted to do with my life is make a difference to the world. That led me into science very quickly.
 - Most scientists will get serious media exposure about twice in their entire career. And they’ll get that because they’ve actually done an experiment that was interesting.
 - The scientific method actually correctly uses the most direct evidence as the most reliable, because that’s the way you are least likely to get led astray into dead ends and to misunderstand your data.
