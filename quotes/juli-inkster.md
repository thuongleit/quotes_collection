 - I think competing is more important than winning. There have been a lot of times when I’ve teed it up and I didn’t win but I felt like I competed. I felt like this was not my day, but I never gave up, and I tried on every shot, and then next week I’d go get them.
 - My three keys to success: One, work hard. Two, be your own person. And three, have a passion for what you’re doing.
 - Golf is a stupid game. You tee up this little ball, really this tiny ball. Then you hit it, try to find it, hit it. And the goal is to get it into a little hole placed in a hard spot.
 - No one has ever conquered this game. One week out there and you are God, next time you are the devil. But it does keep you coming back.
