 - Judgments that constrain your giving are the very demons that are keeping you from receiving.
 - Most unhappy people need to learn just one lesson: how to see themselves through the lens of genuine compassion, and treat themselves accordingly.

 - To care for someone can mean to adore them, feed them, tend their wounds. But care can also signify sorrow, as in ‘bowed down by cares.’ Or anxiety, as in ‘Careful!’ Or investment in an outcome, as in ‘Who cares?’ The word love has no such range of meaning: It’s pure acceptance.
