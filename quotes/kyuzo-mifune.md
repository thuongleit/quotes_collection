 - Do not place hope in finding a secret technique. Polish the mind through ceaseless training; that is the key to effective techniques.
 - Cause your opponent to repent, then let him fall.
 - The mind, if slackened even a little, will cause defeat, the same as fearing the opponent will make you unable to use full strength.
 - A chance to try your technique is in one instant never to be regained, so try it without hesitation.
 - There are no shortcuts because there is no end.
