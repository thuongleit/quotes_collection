 - Oh eyes, no eyes, but fountains fraught with tears; Oh life, no life, but lively form of death; Oh world, no world, but mass of public wrongs.
 - I’ll trust myself, myself shall be my friend.
 - Where words prevail not, violence prevails.
 - Thus must we toil in other men’s extremes, That know not how to remedy our own.
 - Evil news fly faster still than good.
 - In time the savage bull sustains the yoke; In time all haggard hawks will stoop to lure; In time small wedges cleave the hardest oak, In time the flint is pierced with softest shower, And she in time will fall from her disdain, And rue the sufferance of your friendly pain.
 - Fear shall force what friendship cannot win.
 - As I am never better than when I am mad; then methinks I am a brave fellow; then I do wonders: but reason abuseth me, and there’s the torment, there’s the hell.
