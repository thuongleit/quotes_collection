 - It’s always better to shock people and change people’s expectations than to give them exactly what they think you can do.
 - When a movie like ‘Superbad’ or ‘Moneyball’ comes out, people make you feel like you’re the most important person on the planet. The truth is, you’re a billion percent not the most important person on the planet. It’s all insulated in your world and no one could care less. It’s just a movie.

 - I love my parents. But I’m almost 28 and it’s not fun to be asked, ‘What are you doing today? What do you want for dinner? When are you going to be home?’ It just makes you feel like a kid. It’s this juxtaposition of feeling annoyed and really lucky to have people who love you so much.

 - The great thing about ‘Allen Gregory’ is that we try to make it really questionable that the things he says have happened, have really happened. We like that ambiguity.

 - When you go out to make something, you want it to be great. You need to put a bubble around that, so no one can get into the force field and change what you’re setting out to make. That’s all us being producers is doing, is allowing our power to protect the integrity of what you’re doing.
