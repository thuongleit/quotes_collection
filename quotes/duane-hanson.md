 - I do not love fiction, I love history.
 - It doesn’t have to be pretty. It has to be meaningful.
 - It is of no concern to me if one is rich or poor, healthy or sick, at some time or another life will be pretty difficult for everyone. That is one of the reasons why my figures do not smile.
 - My images don’t come close to real life. The world is remarkable, astounding and surprising that one does not need to exaggerate. What actually exists is simply insane.
