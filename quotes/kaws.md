 - Graffiti is like building a career. And there is a dialogue with the other artists out there mostly fellow writers because a lot of people who don’t paint just see a blur when they look at it.
 - It’s just a combination of letters I liked. And when your whole art’s based on the lettering you choose, you kinda figure out what ones work together. I just liked the shapes of the k, a, w, s. It has no meaning.
 - My first interest in graffitti came when I was in grammar school, around ’87 or ’88 I was about twelve years old. I did not know much about writing, I just knew that I liked to write my name everywhere I could in my neighborhood.
 - It’s strange with graffiti. You put a lot out, but you don’t get that much back because not many people know who’s doing it. You have your peers of about 10 guys who know you are the one painting.
