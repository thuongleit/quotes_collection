 - We are the archenemy of our own salvation, and the Shepherd must fight first of all with us â€“ for us.
 - Without the religious element, life is like an engine running without oil-it seizes up.
 - As one candle is lit from the flame of another, so is faith kindled by faith.
 - What can convince modern man is not a historical or a psychological or a continually ever modernizing Christianity but only the unrestricted and uninterrupted message of Revelation.
