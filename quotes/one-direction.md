 - One Band, One Dream, One Direction.
 - Baby you light up my world like nobody else. The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed. And when you smile at the ground it ain’t hard to tell, You don’t know, oh oh, You don’t know your beautiful.
 - Made a lot of changes But not forgetting who i was.
 - You don’t know, oh, oh You don’t know you’re beautiful.
 - You know I’ll be Your Life Your Voice Your Reason To Be My Love My Heart Is Breathing For this Moment in Time I’ll Find the words to say Before You leave me Today.
 - Who do you think you are? Who do you think I am? You only love to see me breaking. You only want me ’cause I’m Taken. No, you don’t really want my heart, no you just like to know you can. Still be the one that gets it breaking, you only want me when I’m Taken.
 - Flashing Lights In My Mind Going Back to The Time Playing Games in the Street Kicking Balls with My Feet Theres a Numb in my toes Standing close to the edge Theres a ball of my clothes at the end of your bed As I feel myself fall Make a joke of it all.
