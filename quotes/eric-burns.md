 - Greatness is more than potential. It is the execution of that potential. Beyond the raw talent. You need the appropriate training. You need the discipline. You need the inspiration. You need the drive.
 - Itâ€™s not enough to create magic. You have to create a price for magic, too. You have to create rules.
 - Greatness is more than potential. It is the execution of that potential.
