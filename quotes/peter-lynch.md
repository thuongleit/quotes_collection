 - All the math you need in the stock market you get in the fourth grade.

 - Just because you buy a stock and it goes up does not mean you are right. Just because you buy a stock and it goes down does not mean you are wrong.
 - There is always something to worry about. Avoid weekend thinking and ignoring the latest dire predictions of the newscasters. Sell a stock because the company’s fundamentals deteriorate, not because the sky is falling.
 - Nobody can predict interest rates, the future direction of the economy or the stock market. Dismiss all such forecasts and concentrate on what’s actually happening to the companies in which you’ve invested.
 - Stocks are a safe bet, but only if you stay invested long enough to ride out the corrections.
 - The person that turns over the most rocks wins the game. And that’s always been my philosophy.
 - Equity mutual funds are the perfect solution for people who want to own stocks without doing their own research.

 - A stock market decline is as routine as a January blizzard in Colorado. If you’re prepared, it can’t hurt you. A decline is a great opportunity to pick up the bargains left behind by investors who are fleeing the storm in panic.

 - You can’t see the future through a rearview mirror.
 - The typical big winner in the Lynch portfolio generally takes three to ten years to play out.

 - Searching for companies is like looking for grubs under rocks: if you turn over 10 rocks you’ll likely find one grub; if you turn over 20 rocks you’ll find two.
 - If you’re prepared to invest in a company, then you ought to be able to explain why in simple language that a fifth grader could understand, and quickly enough so the fifth grader won’t get bored.
 - I think you have to learn that there’s a company behind every stock, and that there’s only one real reason why stocks go up. Companies go from doing poorly to doing well or small companies grow to large companies.

 - I don’t know anyone who said on their deathbed: ‘Gee, I wish I’d spent more time at the office.’
 - If you can follow only one bit of data, follow the earnings – assuming the company in question has earnings. I subscribe to the crusty notion that sooner or later earnings make or break an investment in equities. What the stock price does today, tomorrow, or next week is only a distraction.

 - In business, competition is never as healthy as total domination.
 - Invest in businesses any idiot could run, because someday one will.
 - The natural-born investor is a myth.
 - The Rule of 72 is useful in determining how fast money will grow. Take the annual return from any investment, expressed as a percentage, and divide it into 72. The result is the number of years it will take to double your money.
 - What makes stocks valuable in the long run isn’t the market. It’s the profitability of the shares in the companies you own. As corporate profits increase, corporations become more valuable and sooner or later, their shares will sell for a higher price.
 - Absent a lot of surprises, stocks are relatively predictable over twenty years. As to whether they’re going to be higher or lower in two to three years, you might as well flip a coin to decide.
 - You only need a few good stocks in your lifetime. I mean how many times do you need a stock to go up ten-fold to make a lot of money? Not a lot.

 - Investing is fun and exciting, but dangerous if you don’t do any work.
 - If a picture is worth a thousand words, in business, so is a number.

 - Long shots almost always miss the mark.
 - If you have the stomach for stocks, but neither the time nor the inclination to do the homework, invest in equity mutual funds.

 - There are substantial rewards for adopting a regular routine of investing and following it no matter what, and additional rewards for buying more shares when most investors are scared into selling.
 - My method for picking stocks has never changed. When businesses go from crappy to semicrappy, there’s money to be made.

 - Long-term investing has gotten so popular, it’s easier to admit you’re a crack addict than to admit you’re a short-term investor.
 - Owning stocks is like having children – don’t get involved with more than you can handle.
 - If you hope to have more money tomorrow than you have today, you’ve got to put a chunk of your assets into stocks. Sooner or later, a portfolio of stocks or stock mutual funds will turn out to be a lot more valuable than a portfolio of bonds or CDs or money-market funds.

 - I’ve found that when the market’s going down and you buy funds wisely, at some point in the future you will be happy. You won’t get there by reading ‘Now is the time to buy.’
