 - Our ignorance is not so vast as our failure to use what we know.
 - It is hard to know which is the more remarkable- that it took 600 million years for the Earth to make its oil, or that it took 300 years to use it up.
 - It is evident that the fortunes of the worldâ€™s human population, for better or for worse, are inextricably interrelated with the use that is made of energy resources.
 - History, human or geological, represents our hypothesis, couched in terms of past events, devised to explain our present-day observations.
 - Were we a rational society, a virtue of which we have rarely been accused, we would husband our oil and gas resources.
