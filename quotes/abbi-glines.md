 - I don’t want to lose you. I’m in love with you Blaire. I’ve never wanted anything or anyone the way I want you. I can’t imagine my world now without you in it.
 - I know I’m doing something wrong and I feel guilty but neither of those things matter enough to make me stop.
 - When I’m with you, my world is complete. When I touch you, I understand the meaning of life. When I lost you, I completely shattered. You. Own. Me.

 - I don’t just love her, she owns me. Completely. I’d do anything for her.
 - Talk. We are going to talk first. I want to see you smile and laugh. I want to know what your favorite show was when you were a kid and who made you cry at school and what boy band you hung posters of on your wall. Then I want you naked in my bed again.

 - If you were mine, I would never let you go.

 - This sweet, determined, sexy-as-hell blonde walked into my life and gave me a reason to live.
 - She started walking toward me and perfect white teeth caught her full bottom lip between them. I’d fantasized about those lips way too many times. She’d barely covered up her long tanned legs with a pair of shorts that made me want to go to church this Sunday just to thank God for creating her.
 - You are mine. Do you hear me? You are mine, Della Sloane. I will take care of you. Nothing is taking you away from me. Nothing.

 - No man has ever loved a woman as much as I love you. Nothing will ever come before you. I don’t know what else I have to do to prove to you that I won’t let you down again. I won’t hurt you. You don’t have to be alone anymore. I need you.
 - Hold her for me. Hold her tight. Don’t let her be lonely. Don’t let her hurt. Please.

 - I am in awe of the things you’ve been put through and the fact you can still light up a room when you walk in. When I look at you I see life. I see joy. I see my future.
 - I don’t want you to just be my tutor. I want you to be the girl I look for in the halls every morning and save a seat for in the cafeteria. I want you to be the one waiting for me when I walk off the field at my games. I want you to be the one I pick up the phone to call just to make me smile.
 - Would you tell Dank that I will alway love him? That I’m sorry that I can’t leave here. I’m protecting those I love. But I will think of him every day and I will hum his song to myself every night as I go to sleep.
 - I can’t do this Ash. It’s killing me. Having you this close and not touching you is driving me insane. You’re his Ash. You’re his. You made your choice and I understand why you chose him. I don’t hold it against you but dammit Ash it hurts.

 - Please. Forgive me. One more chance, Blaire. I want this. I want you.
 - Good isn’t my thing but Sawyer’s important to me. Please remember I’ve got my limits and you studying my mouth like you want a taste is pushing me dangerously close to the edge of those limits.

 - Even if I had stayed she wouldn’t have ever wanted me. She didn’t want me for anything more than a summer fling. I was a way of moving on for her.
 - Whatever we had is over. It died the minute I walked downstairs and realized the world I’d always known was a lie.- Blaire Wynn.

 - But when we find that one person who completes us, we don’t give up. No matter how bad we screw up. We make it right.

 - We had our thing. It is a really good memory but now we’re older. Things change.
 - Ashton grinne and raised her eyebrows. “I can’t believe you’re telling me a Vincent boy brought you to Grove, Alabama and not me.” Shrugging, I returned her smile. “They’re heard to resist.” “Don’t I know it.”
