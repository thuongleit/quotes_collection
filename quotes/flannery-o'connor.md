 - It’s easier to bleed than sweat, Mr. Motes.
 - Right now the whole world seems to be going through a dark night of the soul.
 - There may never be anything new to say, but there is always a new way to say it, and since, in art, the way of saying a thing becomes a part of what is said, every work of art is unique and requires fresh attention.
 - In the first place you can be so absolutely honest and so absolutely wrong at the same time that I think it is better to be a combination of cautious and polite.
 - Everywhere I go I’m asked if I think the university stifles writers. My opinion is that they don’t stifle enough of them. There’s many a best-seller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.

 - I am a writer because writing is the thing I do best.
 - Not-writing is a good deal worse than writing.
 - Fiction is about everything human and we are made out of dust, and if you scorn getting yourself dusty, then you shouldn’t try to write fiction. It’s not a grand enough job for you.

 - Total non-retention has kept my education from being a burden to me.
 - The beginning of human knowledge is through the senses, and the fiction writer begins where the human perception begins. He appeals through the senses, and you cannot appeal through the senses with abstractions.

 - To expect too much is to have a sentimental view of life and this is a softness that ends in bitterness.
 - It is the business of the artist to uncover the strangeness of truth.
 - When you can state the theme of a story, when you can separate it from the story itself, then you can be sure the story is not a very good one.

 - If you’re a Catholic you believe what the Church teaches and the climate makes no difference.
 - Children know by instinct that hell is an absence of love, and they can pick out theirs without missing.
 - Nobody with a good car needs to be justified.
 - You don’t serve God by saying: the Church is ineffective, I’ll have none of it. Your pain at its lack of effectiveness is a sign of your nearness to God. We help overcome this lack of effectiveness simply by suffering on account of it.
 - The Southerner is usually tolerant of those weaknesses that proceed from innocence.
 - There was already a deep black wordless conviction in him that the way to avoid Jesus was to avoid sin.
 - You can’t clobber any reader while he’s looking. You divert his attention, then you clobber him and he never knows what hit him.
 - When using dialect, use it lightly. A dialect word here and there is enough. All you want to do is suggest. Never let it call attention to itself.
 - The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.
 - A story has to have muscle as well as meaning, and the meaning has to be in the muscle.
 - It is popular to believe that in order to see clearly one must believe nothing. This may work well enough if you are observing cells under a microscope. It will not work if you are writing fiction. For the fiction writer, to believe nothing is to see nothing.
 - Whenever I’m asked why Southern writers particularly have a penchant for writing about freaks, I say it is because we are still able to recognize one.
 - Our age not only does not have a very sharp eye for the almost imperceptible intrusions of grace, it no longer has much feeling for the nature of the violences which precede and follow them.
 - When there is a tendency to compartmentalize the spiritual and make it resident in a certain type of life only, the spiritual is apt gradually to be lost.
 - As for the blood and the head business, the blood and the head work together and what is not first in the blood can sometimes reach it by going first through the head and what is wrong in the blood can sometimes be tempered by the head.

 - Either practice restraint or be prepared for crowding.

 - I am interested in making up a good case for distortion, as I am coming to believe it is the only way to make people see.

 - Good and evil appear to be joined in every culture at the spine.
 - Anything that comes out of the South is going to be called grotesque by the northern reader, unless it is grotesque, in which case it is going to be called realistic.
 - I come from a family where the only emotion respectable to show is irritation. In some this tendency produces hives, in others literature, in me both.
 - Knowing who you are is good for one generation only. You haven’t the foggiest idea where you stand now or who you are.
 - Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay. I’m always irritated by people who imply that writing fiction is an escape from reality. It is a plunge into reality and it’s very shocking to the system.
 - I am no disbeliever in spiritual purpose and no vague believer. I see from the standpoint of Christian orthodoxy. This means that for me the meaning of life is centered in our Redemption by Christ and what I see in the world I see in relation to that.
 - One old lady who wants her head lifted wouldn’t be so bad, but you multiply her two hundred and fifty thousand times and what you get is a book club.
 - Far be it for me to have worked it out in any abstract way. I don’t know why the bull and Mrs. May have to die, or why Mr. Fortune and Mary Fortune: I just feel in my bones that that is the way it has to be. If I had the abstraction first I don’t suppose I would write the story.
 - It is better to be young in your failures than old in your successes.
 - She looked at nice young men as if she could smell their stupidity.
 - So many people can now write competent stories that the short story is in danger of dying of competence.
 - The old woman was the kind who would not cut down a large old tree because it was a large old tree.
 - He and the girl had almost nothing to say to each other. One thing he did say was, ‘I ain’t got any tattoo on my back.’ ‘What you got on it?’ the girl said. ‘My shirt,’ Parker said. ‘Haw.’ ‘Haw, haw,’ the girl said politely.

 - Tennessee’s a hillbilly dumping ground, and Georgia’s a lousy state too.
 - Success means being heard and don’t stand there and tell me that you are indifferent to being heard. You may write for the joy of it, but the act of writing is not complete in itself. It has to end in its audience.
 - Being a Georgia author is a rather specious dignity, on the same order as, for the pig, being a Talmadge ham.
 - There is no excuse for anyone to write fiction for public consumption unless he has been called to do so by the presence of a gift. It is the nature of fiction not to be good for much unless it is good in itself.

 - Unadaptability is often a virtue.
 - I spend three hours a day writing and the rest of my day getting over it.

 - Ours is the first age in history which has asked the child what he would tolerate learning.
 - The novelist is required to open his eyes on the world around him and look. If what he sees is not highly edifying, he is still required to look. Then he is required to reproduce, with words, what he sees.
 - It is hard to make your adversaries real people unless you recognize yourself in them – in which case, if you don’t watch out, they cease to be adversaries.

 - Anyone who survives a southern childhood has enough material to last a lifetime.
 - Christianity is a strangely cheery religion.

 - The way to despair is to refuse to have any kind of experience.
 - People without hope not only don’t write novels, but what is more to the point, they don’t read them. They don’t take long looks at anything, because they lack the courage. The way to despair is to refuse to have any kind of experience, and the novel, of course, is a way to have experience.
 - The idea of being a writer attracts a good many shiftless people, those who are merely burdened with poetic feelings or afflicted with sensibility.
 - I can, with one eye squinted, take it all as a blessing.
 - I never understand how writers can succumb to vanity – what you work the hardest on is usually the worst.
 - Everything that gave her pleasure was small and depressed him.
 - Does one’s integrity ever lie in what he is not able to do? I think that usually it does, for free will does not mean one will, but many wills conflicting in one man. Freedom cannot be conceived simply. It is a mystery and one which a novel, even a comic novel, can only be asked to deepen.
 - Doctors always think anybody doing something they aren’t is a quack; also they think all patients are idiots.
 - There’s many a bestseller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.
 - When she told a story, she rolled her eyes and waved her head and was very dramatic.
 - Manners are of such great consequence to the novelist that any kind will do. Bad manners are better than no manners at all, and because we are losing our customary manners, we are probably overly conscious of them; this seems to be a condition that produces writers.

 - It is always difficult to get across to people who are not professional writers that a talent to write does not mean a talent to write anything at all.
 - The meaning of the story is the story.
 - Harcourt sent my book to Evelyn Waugh and his comment was: “If this is really the unaided work of a young lady, it is a remarkable product.” My mother was vastly insulted. She put the emphasis on if and lady. Does he suppose you’re not a lady? she says.

 - Every morning between 9 and 12 I go to my room and sit before a piece of paper. Many times, I just sit for three hours with no ideas coming to me. But I know one thing. If an idea does come between 9 and 12 I am there ready for it.

 - Most of us come to the church by a means the church does not allow.
 - It’s always wrong of course to say that you can’t do this or you can’t do that in fiction. You can do anything you can get away with, but nobody has ever gotten away with much.
 - Technique in the minds of many is something rigid, something like a formula that you impose on the material; but in the best stories it is something organic, something that grows out of the material, and this being the case, it is different for every story of any account that has ever been written.
 - Writing is a good example of self-abandonment. I never completely forget myself except when I am writing and I am never more completely myself than when I am writing.
 - Poorly written novels – no matter how pious and edifying the behavior of the characters – are not good in themselves and are therefore not really edifying.
 - The type of mind that can understand good fiction is not necessarily the educated mind, but it is at all times the kind of mind that is willing to have its sense of mystery deepened by contact with reality, and its sense of reality deepened by contact with mystery.
 - The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction. I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail. She makes Mickey Spillane look like Dostoevsky.
 - I’m going to preach there was no Fall because there was nothing to fall from, and no Redemption because there was no Fall, and no Judgment because there wasn’t the first two. Nothing matters but that Jesus was a liar.
 - I was a very ancient twelve; my views at that age would have done credit to a Civil War veteran. I am much younger now than I was at twelve or anyway, less burdened. The weight of the centuries lies on children, I’m sure of it.

 - She felt that she would have to be much more than just a doctor or an engineer. She would have to be a saint...
 - I distrust pious phrases, especially when they issue from my mouth. I try militantly never to be affected by the pious language of the faithful but it is always coming out when you least expect it. In contrast to the pious language of the faithful, the liturgy is beautifully flat.
 - We are not judged by what we are basically. We are judged by how hard we use what we have been given. Success means nothing to the Lord.
 - I know that the writer does call up the general and maybe the essential through the particular, but this general and essential is still deeply embedded in mystery. It is not answerable to any of our formulas.
 - I find that most people know what a story is until they sit down to write one. Then they find themselves writing a sketch with an essay woven through it, or an essay with a sketch woven through it, or an editorial with a character in it, or a case history with a moral, or some other mongrel thing.

 - In most good stories, it is the character’s personality that creates the action of the story. If you start with real personality, a real character, then something is bound to happen.
 - There is a question whether faith can or is supposed to be emotionally satisfying. I must say that the thought of everyone lolling about in an emotionally satisfying faith is repugnant to me. I believe that we are ultimately directed Godward but that this journey is often impeded by emotion.

 - I find that most people know what a story is until they sit down to write one.

 - You get a real person down there and his talking will take care of itself.
