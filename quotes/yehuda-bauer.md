 - Thou shalt not be a victim, thou shalt not be a perpetrator, but, above all, thou shalt not be a bystander.
 - The horror of the Holocaust is not that it deviated from human norms; the horror is that it didnâ€™t. What happened may happen again, to others not necessarily Jews, perpetrated by others, not necessarily Germans. We are all possible victims, possible perpetrators, possible bystanders.
