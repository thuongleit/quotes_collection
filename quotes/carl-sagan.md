 - I don't want to believe. I want to know.
 - Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.
 - The cosmos is within us. We are made of star-stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself.
 - The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.
 - We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.
 - We are like butterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.
 - The universe is a pretty big place. If it’s just us, seems like an awful waste of space.
 - Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.
 - We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.
 - It pays to keep an open mind, but not so open your brains fall out.
 - The sky calls to us. If we do not destroy ourselves, we will one day venture to the stars.
 - We are star stuff which has taken its destiny into its own hands.
 - For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love.
 - Across the sea of space, the stars are other suns.
 - Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.
 - If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.
 - In all our searching, the only thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other.
 - The universe seems neither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent.
 - We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people.
 - You are made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.
 - Science is a way of thinking much more than it is a body of knowledge.
 - We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still.
 - The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence.
 - If it can be destroyed by the truth, it deserves to be destroyed by the truth.
 - Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. We have lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to set sail for the stars.
 - We are made of star-stuff. Our bodies are made of star-stuff. There are pieces of star within us all.
 - Your god is too small for my universe.
 - You have to know the past to understand the present.
 - The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be.
 - All civilizations become either spacefaring or extinct.
 - Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
 - Don’t judge everyone else by your own limited experience.
 - We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology.
 - Preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we’ve ever known.
 - After the earth dies, some 5 billion years from now, after it’s burned to a crisp, or even swallowed by the Sun, there will be other worlds and stars and galaxies coming into being – and they will know nothing of a place once called Earth.
 - One glance at a book and you hear the voice of another person, perhaps someone dead for 1,000 years. To read is to voyage through time.
 - Understanding is a kind of ecstasy.
 - Who are we, if not measured by our impact on others? That’s who we are! We’re not who we say we are, we’re not who we want to be – we are the sum of the influence and impact that we have, in our lives, on others.
 - Extinction is the rule. Survival is the exception.
 - The brain is like a muscle. When it is in use we feel very good. Understanding is joyous.
 - Science is more than a body of knowledge. It’s a way of thinking: a way of skeptically interrogating the universe.
 - Even through your hardest days, remember we are all made of stardust.
 - Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of magic.
 - It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.
 - Every star may be a sun to someone.
 - The cure for a fallacious argument is a better argument, not the suppression of ideas.
 - You can’t convince a believer of anything; for their belief is not based on evidence, it’s based on a deep seated need to believe.
 - The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it, but the way those atoms are put together.
 - There are in fact 100 billion galaxies, each of which contain something like a 100 billion stars. Think of how many stars, and planets, and kinds of life there may be in this vast and awesome universe.
 - There are naive questions, tedious questions, ill-phrased questions, questions put after inadequate self-criticism. But every question is a cry to understand the world. There is no such thing as a dumb question.
 - To live in the hearts of others is to never die in those we leave behind.
 - The notion that science and spirituality are somehow mutually exclusive does a disservice to both.
 - When Kepler found his long-cherished belief did not agree with the most precise observation, he accepted the uncomfortable fact. He preferred the hard truth to his dearest illusions, that is the heart of science.
 - Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable. If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.
 - In the vastness of space and the immensity of time, it is my joy to share a planet and an epoch with Annie.
 - Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting fantasy.
 - Science is only a Latin word for knowledge.
 - Valid criticism does you a favor.
 - A new consciousness is developing which sees the earth as a single organism and recognizes that an organism at war with itself is doomed. We are one planet.
 - I promise to question everything my leaders tell me. I promise to use my critical faculties. I promise to develop my independence of thought. I promise to educate myself so I can make my own judgments.
 - You’re an interesting species. An interesting mix. You’re capable of such beautiful dreams, and such horrible nightmares. You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you’re not. See, in all our searching, the only thing we’ve found that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other.
 - Maxwell’s Equations have had a greater impact on human history than any ten presidents.
 - Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe are challenged by this point of pale light.
 - But our preferences do not determine what’s true.
 - We are one species. We are starstuff.
 - Not explaining science seems to me perverse. When you’re in love, you want to tell the world.
 - The nuclear arms race is like two sworn enemies standing waist deep in gasoline, one with three matches, the other with five.
 - I don’t know the answer. Maybe no one knows. Maybe when you grow up, you’ll be the first to find out.
 - We are an intelligent species and the use of our intelligence quite properly gives us pleasure. In this respect the brain is like a muscle. When we think well, we feel good. Understanding is a kind of ecstasy.
 - When we look up at night and view the stars, everything we see is shinning because of distant nuclear fusion.
 - A multitude of aspects of the natural world that were considered miraculous only a few generations ago are now thoroughly understood in terms of physics and chemistry.
 - For all its material advantages, the sedentary life has left us edgy, unfulfilled, even after 400 generations in villages and cities, we haven’t forgotten: The open road still softly calls like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.
 - Life is but a momentary glimpse of the wonder of this astonishing universe, and it is sad to see so many dreaming it away on spiritual fantasy.
 - You’re capable of such beautiful dreams and such horrible nightmares...
 - When you make the finding yourself – even if you’re the last person on Earth to see the light – you’ll never forget it.
 - Once we overcome our fear of being tiny, we find ourselves on the threshold of a vast and awesome Universe that utterly dwarfs – in time, in space, and in potential – the tidy anthropocentric proscenium of our ancestors.
 - My parents were not scientists. They knew almost nothing about science. But in introducing me simultaneously to skepticism and to wonder, they taught me the two uneasily cohabiting modes of thought that are central to the scientific method.
 - Time spent with children is time well spent. Their little minds are not constrained by ‘reality’ or focused upon goals. Anything and everything is possible. Imagination will often carry us to worlds that never were. But without it we go nowhere.
 - It is of interest to note that while some dolphins are reported to have learned English – up to fifty words used in correct context – no human being has been reported to have learned dolphinese.
 - Our species needs, and deserves, a citizenry with minds wide awake and a basic understanding of how the world works.
 - We are, in the most profound sense, children of the Cosmos.
 - Advances in medicine and agriculture have saved vastly more lives than have been lost in all the wars in history.
 - Extraordinary claim requires extraordinary proof.
 - People are not stupid. They believe things for reasons. The last way for skeptics to get the attention of bright, curious, intelligent people is to belittle or condescend or to show arrogance toward their beliefs.
 - We live in a vast and awesome universe in which, daily, suns are made and worlds destroyed, where humanity clings to an obscure clod of rock.
 - An organism at war with itself is doomed.
 - The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious chauvinism to rabid nationalist fervor, are beginning not to work.
 - Arguments from authority carry little weight – authorities have made mistakes in the past. They will do so again in the future. Perhaps a better way to say it is that in science there are no authorities; at most, there are experts.
 - Other things being equal, it is better to be smart than to be stupid.
 - My fundamental premise about the brain is that its workings – what we sometimes call “mind” – are a consequence of its anatomy and physiology, and nothing more.
 - We have heard the rationales offered by the nuclear superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations. But who speaks for the human species? Who speaks for Earth?
 - Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can work magic.
 - In the long run, the aggressive civilizations destroy themselves, almost always. It’s their nature. They can’t help it.
 - What an astonishing thing a book is.
 - So those who wished for some central cosmic purpose for us, or at least our world, or at least our solar system, or at least our galaxy, have been disappointed, progressively disappointed. The universe is not responsive to our ambitious expectations.
 - The suppression of uncomfortable ideas may be common in religion or in politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no in the endeavor of science. We do not know in advance who will discover fundamental insights.
 - Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze.
 - Accommodation to change, the thoughtful pursuit of alternative futures are keys to the survival of civilization and perhaps of the human species.
 - The illegality of cannabis is outrageous, an impediment to full utilization of a drug which helps produce the serenity and insight, sensitivity and fellowship so desperately needed in this increasingly mad and dangerous world.
 - We live in a society exquisitely dependent on science.
 - Anything else you’re interested in is not going to happen if you can’t breathe the air and drink the water. Don’t sit this one out. Do something. You are by accident of fate alive at an absolutely critical moment in the history of our planet.
 - The total number of stars in the Universe is larger than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of the planet Earth.
 - Science is not perfect. It’s often misused; it’s only a tool, but it’s the best tool we have. Self-correcting, ever changing, applicable to everything: with this tool, we vanquish the impossible.
 - But I could be wrong.
 - And after we returned to the savannahs and abandoned the trees, did we long for those great graceful leaps and ecstatic moments of weightlessness in the shafts of sunlight of the forest roof?
 - Cosmos is a Greek word for the order of the universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectedness of all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is put together.
 - Books are key to understanding the world and participating in a democratic society.
 - We are the product of 4.5 billion years of fortuitous, slow biological evolution. There is no reason to think that the evolutionary process has stopped. Man is a transitional animal. He is not the climax of creation.
 - Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality.
 - The desire to be connected with the cosmos reflects a profound reality, but we are connected; not in the trivial ways that astrology promises, but in the deepest ways.
 - Be grateful everyday for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.
 - We live on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.
 - We are, each of us, a multitude. Within us is a little universe.
 - In our time, we have sifted the sands of Mars, we have established a presence there, we have fulfilled a century of dreams!
 - A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic.
 - A galaxy is composed of gas and dust and stars – billions upon billions of stars. Every star may be a sun to someone.
 - Billions and billions.
 - Our ancestors worshipped the Sun, and they were not that foolish. It makes sense to revere the Sun and the stars, for we are their children.
 - The universe is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition.
 - There are as many atoms in one molecule of DNA as there are stars in a typical galaxy.
 - Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of our ancestors.
 - I believe our future depends powerfully on how well we understand this cosmos in which we float, like a mote of dust in the morning sky.
 - It will not be we who reach Alpha Centauri, and the other nearby stars. It will be a species very like us – but with more of our strengths and fewer of our weaknesses.
 - The truth may be puzzling. It may take some work to grapple with. It may be counterintuitive. It may contradict deeply held prejudices. It may not be consonant with what we desperately want to be true. But our preferences do not determine what’s true.
 - We are made of star stuff. For the most part, atoms heavier than hydrogen were created in the interiors of stars and then expelled into space to be incorporated into later stars. The Sun is probably a third generation star.
 - Atoms are mainly empty space. Matter is composed chiefly of nothing.
 - We humans appear on the cosmic calendar so recently that our recorded history occupies only the last few seconds of the last minute of December 31st.
 - If I finish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth of a percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know which books to read.
 - We on Earth have just awakened to the great oceans of space and time from which we have emerged.
 - We are the custodians of life’s meaning.
 - The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home.
 - Every kid starts out as a natural-born scientist, and then we beat it out of them. A few trickle through the system with their wonder and enthusiasm for science intact.
 - For all our failings, despite our limitations and fallibilities, we humans are capable of greatness.
 - The sacred truth of science is that there are no sacred truths.
 - Any civilization that doesn’t develop space travel dies.
 - We wish to find the truth, no matter where it lies. But to find the truth we need imagination and skepticism both. We will not be afraid to speculate, but we will be careful to distinguish speculation from fact.
 - Maybe it’s a little early. Maybe the time is not quite yet. But those other worlds – promising untold opportunities – beckon. Silently, they orbit the Sun, waiting.
 - We are made of stellar ash. Our origin and evolution have been tied to distant cosmic events. The exploration of the cosmos is a voyage of self-discovery.
 - There are lots of ways to communicate what we know, but few ways to communicate what we feel. Music is one way to communicate emotions.
 - Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth.
 - The words “question” and “quest” are cognates. Only through inquiry can we discover truth.
 - What began in deadly competition has helped us to see that global cooperation is the essential precondition for our survival. Travel is broadening. It’s time to hit the road again.
 - The open road still softly calls, like a nearly forgotten song of childhood.
 - We should be teaching our children the scientific method and the reasons for a Bill of Rights. With it comes a certain decency, humility and community spirit.
 - Many religions have attempted to make statues of their gods very large, and the idea, I suppose, is to make us feel small. But if that’s their purpose, they can keep their paltry icons. We need only look up if we wish to feel small.
 - Stars are phoenixes, rising from their own ashes.
 - Every thinking person fears nuclear war, and every technological state plans for it. Everyone knows it is madness, and every nation has an excuse.
 - By looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time, back toward the horizon of the universe, back toward the epoch of the Big Bang.
 - Who is more humble? The scientist who looks at the universe with an open mind and accepts whatever the universe has to teach us, or somebody who says everything in this book must be considered the literal truth and never mind the fallibility of all the human beings involved?
 - I worry that, especially as the Millennium edges nearer, pseudo-science and superstition will seem year by year more tempting, the siren song of unreason more sonorous and attractive.
 - Cutting off fundamental, curiosity-driven science is like eating the seed corn. We may have a little more to eat next winter but what will we plant so we and our children will have enough to get through the winters to come?
 - The prediction of nuclear winter is drawn not, of course, from any direct experience with the consequences of global nuclear war, but rather from an investigation of the governing physics.
 - Better the hard truth, I say, than the comforting fantasy. And in the final tolling it often turns out that the facts are more comforting than the fantasy.
 - Who will speak for Planet Earth?
 - I think if we ever reach the point where we think we thoroughly understand who we are and where we came from, we will have failed.
 - The candle flame gutters. Its little pool of light trembles. Darkness gathers. The demons begin to stir.
 - But nature is always more subtle, more intricate, more elegant than what we are able to imagine.
 - Whatever the reason you’re on Mars, I’m glad you’re there, and I wish I was with you.
 - It is the tension between creativity and skepticism that has produced the stunning and unexpected findings of science.
 - A blade of grass is a commonplace on Earth; it would be a miracle on Mars. Our descendants on Mars will know the value of a patch of green. And if a blade of grass is priceless, what is the value of a human being?
 - First rule in government spending: Why build one, when you can have two at twice the price?
 - Real patriots ask questions.
 - The open road still softly calls...
 - Ask courageous questions. Do not be satisfied with superficial answers.
 - Each of us is a tiny being, permitted to ride on the outermost skin of one of the smaller planets for a few dozen trips around the local star.
 - In the fabric of space and in the nature of matter, as in a great work of art, there is, written small, the artist’s signature.
 - We are star stuff harvesting sunlight.
 - The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.
 - Those who seek power at any price detect a societal weakness, a fear that they can ride into office.
 - To read is to voyage through time.
 - Those with the courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differs profoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries.
 - It is all a matter of time scale. An event that would be unthinkable in a hundred years may be inevitable in a hundred million.
 - Not all birds can fly. What separates the flyers from the walkers is the ability to take off.
 - The dumbing down of America is evident in the slow decay of substantive content, a kind of celebration of ignorance.
 - Modern science has been a voyage into the unknown, with a lesson in humility waiting at every stop. Many passengers would rather have stayed home.
 - The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. From it we have learned most of what we know. Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen our toes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls.
 - We humans look rather different from a tree. Without a doubt we perceive the world differently than a tree does. But down deep, at the molecular heart of life, the trees and we are essentially identical.
 - Human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are members of a larger group.
 - The immense distances to the stars and the galaxies mean that we see everything ins pace int he past, some as they were before the Earth came to be. Telescopes are time machines.
 - If we can’t think for ourselves, if we’re unwilling to question authority, then we’re just putty in the hands of those in power.
 - My view is that if there is no evidence for it, then forget about it. An agnostic is somebody who doesn’t believe in something until there is evidence for it, so I’m agnostic.
 - But down deep, at the molecular heart of life we’re essentially identical to trees.
 - The uniqueness of humans has been claimed on many grounds, but most often because of our tool-making, culture, language, reason and morality. We have them, the other animals don’t, and – so the argument goes – that’s that.
 - We are the only species on the planet, so far as we know, to have invented a communal memory stored neither in our genes nor in our brains. The warehouse of this memory is called the library.
 - The Hindu religion is the only of the World’s great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths.
 - Nothing disturbs me more than the glorification of stupidity.
 - It does no harm to the romance of the sunset to know a little bit about it.
 - This oak tree and me, we’re made of the same stuff.
 - It is clear that the nations of the world now can only rise and fall together. It is not a question of one nation winning at the expense of another. We must all help one another or all perish together.
 - We were wanderers from the beginning.
 - Where did God come from? If we decide this is an unanswerable question why not save a step and conclude that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question.
 - Demon mean knowledge in Greek, especially about the material world. Science means knowledge in Latin. A jurisdictional dispute is exposed, even if we look no further.
 - Man is the matter of the cosmos, contemplating itself.
 - Where we have strong emotions, we’re liable to fool ourselves.
 - Virtually every major technological advance in the history of the human species – back to the invention of stone tools and the domestication of fire – has been ethically ambiguous.
 - Science is a way to call the bluff of those who only pretend to knowledge. It is a bulwark against mysticism, against superstition, against religion misapplied to where it has no business being.
 - What a marvelous cooperative arrangement – plants and animals each inhaling each other’s exhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegant cycle powered by a star 150 million kilometers away.
 - The passion to explore is at the heart of being human.
 - There is a lurking fear that some things are not meant to be known.
 - On the day that we do discover that we are not alone, our society may begin to evolve and transform in some incredible and wondrous new ways.
 - If the greenhouse effect is a blanket in which we wrap ourselves to keep warm, nuclear winter kicks the blanket off.
 - Is mankind alone in the universe? Or are there somewhere other intelligent beings looking up into their night sky from very different worlds and asking the same kind of question?
 - Observation: I can’t see a thing. Conclusion: Dinosaurs.
 - Frederick Douglas taught that literacy is the path from slavery to freedom. There are many kinds of slavery and many kinds of freedom, but reading is still the path.
 - I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students.
 - I believe that the extraordinary should be pursued. But extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
 - All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value.
 - Knowing a great deal is not the same as being smart; intelligence is not information alone but also judgement, the manner in which information is coordinated and used.
 - Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.
 - If we say that God has always been, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always been?
 - It is said that men may not be the dreams of the god, but rather that the gods are the dreams of men.
 - Books are like seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the most unpromising soil.
 - A religion old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science, might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths. Sooner or later such a religion will emerge.
 - Any sufficiently crisp question can be answered by a single binary digit-0 or 1, yes or no.
 - I’m only a four-dimensional creature. Haven’t got a clue how to visualise infinity. Even Einstein hadn’t. I know because I asked him.
 - Thus the recent rapid evolution of human intelligence is not only the cause of but also the only conceivable solution to the many serious problems that beset us.
 - My wonder button is being pushed all the time.
 - If our long-term survival is at stake, we have a basic responsibility to our species to venture to other worlds. Sailors on a becalmed sea, we sense the stirring of a breeze.
 - An atheist is someone who is certain that God does not exist, someone who has compelling evidence against the existence of God. I know of no such compelling evidence.
 - If you are only skeptical, then no new ideas make it through to you.
 - I maintain there is much more wonder in science than in pseudoscience. And in addition, to whatever measure this term has any meaning, science has the additional virtue, and it is not an inconsiderable one, of being true.
 - Books tap the wisdom of our species – the greatest minds, the best teachers – from all over the world and from all our history. And they’re patient.
 - Science is a collaborative enterprise, spanning the generations. When it permits us to see the far side of some new horizon, we remember those who prepared the way – seeing for them also.
 - The method of science, as stodgy and grumpy as it may seem, is far more important than the findings of science.
 - Football is a thinly disguised re-enactment of hunting; we played it before we were human.
 - One trend that bothers me is the glorification of stupidity, that the media is reassuring people it’s alright not to know anything. That to me is far more dangerous than a little pornography on the Internet.
 - Except for fools and madmen, everyone knows that nuclear war would he an unprecedented human catastrophe.
 - Clutching our crystals and religiously consulting our horoscopes, our critical faculties in steep decline, unable to distinguish between what’s true and what feels good, we slide, almost without noticing, into superstition and darkness.
 - As the ancient myth makers knew, we are children equally of the earth and the sky.
 - The simplest thought, like the concept of the number one, has an elaborate logical underpinning.
 - There is today-in a time when old beliefs are withering-a kind of philosophical hunger, a need to know who we are and how we got here. It is an on-going search, often unconscious, for a cosmic perspective for humanity.
 - Atheism is very stupid.
 - Otherwise we don’t run the government the government runs us.
 - Those at too great a distance may, I am well are, mistake ignorance for perspective.
 - There is a report that says that kids who watch violent TV programs tend to be more violent when they grow up. But did the TV cause the violence, or do violent children preferentially enjoy watching violent programs?
 - Our children long for realistic maps of the future that they can be proud of. Where are the cartographers of human purpose?
 - Science is based on experiment, on a willingness to challenge old dogma, on an openness to see the universe as it really is. Accordingly, science sometimes requires courage – at the very least the courage to question the conventional wisdom.
 - If we continue to accumulate only power and not wisdom, we will surely destroy ourselves.
 - Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretend to nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer the fleeting comforts of superstition.
 - Science is a way to not fool ourselves.
 - It would be wryly interesting if in human history the cultivation of marijuana led generally to the invention of agriculture, and thereby to civilization.
 - The method of science is tried and true. It is not perfect, it’s just the best we have. And to abandon it, with its skeptical protocols, is the pathway to a dark age.
 - Any faith that admires truth, that strives to know God, must be brave enough to accommodate the universe.
 - The price we pay for anticipation of the future is anxiety about it.
 - The gears of poverty, ignorance, hopelessness and low self-esteem interact to create a kind of perpetual failure machine that grinds down dreams from generation to generation. We all bear the cost of keeping it running. Illiteracy is its linchpin.
 - We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose.
 - When permitted to listen to alternative opinions and engage in substantive debate, people have been known to change their minds. It can happen.
 - Our perceptions are fallible. We sometimes see what isn’t there. We are prey to optical illusions. Occasionally we hallucinate. We are error-prone.
 - Which aspects of our nature will prevail is uncertain, particularly when our visions and prospects are bound to one small part of the small planet Earth. But up there in the Cosmos an inescapable perspective awaits.
 - It seems madness to say, ‘We’re worried that they’re going to become addicted to marijuana’ – there’s no evidence whatever that it’s an addictive drug, but even if it were, these people are dying, what are we saving them from?
 - Not all bits have equal value.
 - Our concern for the future can be tested by how well we support our libraries.
 - Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions.
 - It’s sometimes easier to reject strong evidence than to admit that we’ve been wrong, this is information about ourselves worth having.
 - Our ancestors lived out of doors. They were as familiar with the night sky as most of us are with our favorite television programs.
 - One of the great commandments of science is: ‘Mistrust arguments from authority.’
 - In a complex universe, in a society undergoing unprecedented change, how can we find the truth if we are not willing to question everything and to give a fair hearing to everything?
 - But the fact that some geniuses were laughed at does not imply that all who are laughed at are geniuses. They laughed at Columbus, they laughed at Fulton, they laughed at the Wright Brothers. But they also laughed at Bozo the Clown.
 - The secrets of evolution are death and time-the deaths of enormous numbers of lifeforms that were imperfectly adapted to the environment; and time for a long succession of small mutations.
 - The fact is that far more crime and child abuse has been committed by zealots in the name of God, Jesus and Mohammed than has ever been committed in the name of Satan. Many people don’t like that statement, but few can argue with it.
 - Writing a novel is like trying to solve a very long mathematical equation. Changing anything can change everything else.
 - But amid much elegance and precision, the details of life and the Universe also exhibit haphazard, jury-rigged arrangements and much poor planning. What shall we make of this: an edifice abandoned early in construction by the architect?
 - How smart does a chimp have to be before killing him constitutes murder?
 - Science is far from a perfect instrument of knowledge. It’s just the best we have.
 - A millennium before Europeans were willing to divest themselves of the Biblical idea that the world was a few thousand years old, the Mayans were thinking of millions and the Hindus billions.
 - It’s hard to kill a creature once it lets you see its consciousness.
 - The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean.
 - I find science so much more fascinating than science fiction. It also has the advantage of being true.
 - I consider it an extremely dangerous doctrine, because the more likely we are to assume that the solution comes from the outside, the less likely we are to solve our problems ourselves.
 - Humans – who enslave, castrate, experiment on, and fillet other animals – have had an understandable penchant for pretending animals do not feel pain.
 - What counts is not what sounds plausible, not what we would like to believe, not what one or two witnesses claim, but only what is supported by hard evidence rigorously and skeptically examined. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
 - You are worth about 3 dollars worth in chemicals.
 - I can find in my undergraduate classes, bright students who do not know that the stars rise and set at night, or even that the Sun is a star.
 - These days there seems to be nowhere left to explore, at least on the land area of the Earth. Victims of their very success, the explorers now pretty much stay home.
