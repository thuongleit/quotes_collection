 - Racing is a matter of spirit not strength.
 - Racing is a calling, a passion.
 - Racing takes everything you’ve got – intellectually, emotionally, physically – and then you have to find about ten percent more and use that too.
 - Let me ask you. If someone called you and offered you a ride in the Indianapolis 500 and you were a male race car driver, would you turn the ride down?
 - You drive the car, you don’t carry it.
 - I’m trying to set out the passion and complexity of this sport. Many people think it’s a dumb activity: stand on the gas and turn left. In fact, it’s probably one of the most complex sports in existence.
 - There is very little in civilized life that demands everything you got intellectually, physically, and emotionally. Driving is living. It’s aggressive instead of passive living.
 - It is a matter of spirit, not strength. It is a matter of doing your best each little moment. There’s never a break. You must have desire, a very intense desire to keep going.
