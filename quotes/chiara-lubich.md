 - In life we do many things, say many things, but the voice of suffering offered out of love – which is perhaps unheard by and unknown to others – is the loudest cry that can penetrate Heaven.
 - Lose everything, even the attachment to holiness, so that you aim only at one thing: to love.
 - Be aware that the fire that does not grow is extinguished.
