 - Cate Blanchett is mesmerizing. I don’t know why. It’s beyond my understanding. Why we all want to work with her is she elevates the rest of us. She’s just got some ethereal grace and elegance that’s beyond me, and an acute understanding of human nature. She’s just exquisite. She’s otherworldly.

 - New Orleans has a real spirit. It’s the most authentic of all American cities.
