 - The five S’s of sports training are: stamina, speed, strength, skill, and spirit; but the greatest of these is spirit.
 - A runners creed: I will win; if I cannot win, I shall be second; if I cannot be second, I shall be third; if I cannot place at all, I shall still do my best.

 - I still have the same hunger like I did 20 years ago but it’s a different sort of reflection when you lose. It doesn’t hurt you as much because I feel like I’ve had a good career.
