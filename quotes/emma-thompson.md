 - I think books are like people, in the sense that they’ll turn up in your life when you most need them. I firmly believe there are books whose greatness actually enables you to live, to do something. And sometimes, human beings need story and narrative more than they need nourishment and food.
 - Any problem, big or small, within a family, always seems to start with bad communication. Someone isn’t listening.
 - I want a different world. One where I don’t wake up thinking I’m so lucky to be able to feed my daughter, and able to give people a clean drink of water. I don’t want images of starving babies at the breast in my mind. I want that to change. And if I want that, I had better do something about it.
 - Piracy is our only option.
 - I don’t think people understand that being poor means you have to work from dawn until dusk just to survive through the day. I think there’s some notion that poor people lie about all day not doing anything.

 - I think our hearts are very chemical and we change the way we see people according to how we feel about them. That’s what love is, in a way.
 - But when I lose my temper, I find it difficult to forgive myself. I feel I’ve failed. I can be calm in a crisis, in the face of death or things that hurt badly. I don’t get hysterical, which may be masochistic of me.
 - I am who I am, and there is nothing I can do about that.
 - The trick is to age honestly and gracefully and make it look great, so that everyone looks forward to it.

 - The thing that influenced me most in relation to ‘Nanny McPhee’ were the Westerns I watched with my father. All the Spaghetti Westerns; all the Virginians; all the High Chaparrals. Because if you think about the form, it’s a stranger from out of town.
 - It’s not funny at all that we do all that advertising for children. Why is advertising for children allowed? What possible reason can there be for having those effing adverts on TV for all this crap that’s made by poor people in poor countries that we sell our children who have too much?

 - Sometimes I get to put on posh frocks and be Madam Glamour, the vendor of my wares. My lovely friend Kath, a stylist, puts me into things I’d never dream of. But my real life is very different. It’s very, very home-based – an intense domestic life, that’s the core of everything.
 - If you don’t want women to do whatever they need to do then you must provide them with food, you must provide them with shelter and their basic human rights.

 - It’s such a cold night and it’s the only time I’ve actively been grateful for menopause. I’ve been entirely comfortable.

 - I’ve realized that in all the great stories, even if there’s a happily-ever-after ending, there’s something sad.

 - I think that the Bible as a system of moral guidance in the 21st century is insufficient, to put it mildly. I feel quite strongly that we need a new moral lodestone if we can’t rely on what is inside our own selves. Which I think, actually, is pretty reliable.
 - I have had lots of friends who’ve been affected by Aids and a very good friend of mine, Oscar Moore, died of Aids and I was with him in his last year quite a bit. And of course he was a man living in a very rich culture with a wealthy family who was able to afford health care.
