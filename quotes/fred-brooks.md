 - Nine people can’t make a baby in a month.
 - The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.
 - Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
 - You can learn more from failure than success. In failure you’re forced to find out what part did not work. But in success you can believe everything you did was great, when in fact some parts may not have worked at all. Failure forces you to face reality.
 - Dissertations are not finished; they are abandoned.
 - The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.
 - A scientist builds in order to learn; an engineer learns in order to build.
 - The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.
 - Job Control Language is the worst programming language ever designed anywhere by anybody for any purpose.
 - I have never seen an experienced programmer who routinely made detailed flow charts before beginning to write programs.
 - How does a project get to be a year behind schedule? One day at a time.
 - The Waterfall Model is wrong and harmful; we must outgrow it.
 - Present to inform, not to impress. If you inform, you will impress.
 - Systems program building is an entropy-decreasing process, hence inherently metastable. Program maintenance is an entropy-increasing process, and even its most skillful execution only delays the subsidence of the system into unfixable obsolescence.
 - Conceptual integrity is the most important consideration in system design.
 - Einstein argued that there must be simplified explanations of nature, because God is not capricious or arbitrary. No such faith comforts the software engineer.
 - Show me your flowcharts and conceal your tables, and I shall continue to be mystified. Show me your tables, and I won’t usually need your flowcharts; they’ll be obvious.
 - The complexity of software is an essential property, not an accidental one. Hence, descriptions of a software entity that abstract away its complexity often abstracts away its essence.
 - More software projects have gone awry for lack of calendar time than for all other causes combined.
 - Even the best planning is not so omniscient as to get it right the first time.
 - Men and months are interchangeable commodities only when a task can be partitioned among many workers with no communication among them.
 - Process improvement is most valuable in raising the floor of a community’s practice.
 - A design style is defined by a set of microdecisions. A clear style reflects a consistent set. A clear style may not be a good style; a muddled one never is.
 - Predictability and great design are not friends.
 - Originality is no excuse for ignorance.
 - System debugging, like astronomy, has always been done chiefly at night.
 - It is very difficult to make a vigorous, plausible, and job-risking defense of an estimate that is derived by no quantitative method, supported by little data, and certified chiefly by the hunches of the managers.
 - To only a fraction of the human race does God give the privilege of earning one’s bread doing what one would have gladly pursued free, for passion.
 - A basic principle of data processing teaches the folly of trying to maintain independent files in synchonism.
 - Successful software always gets changed.
 - The hardest part of the software task is arriving at a complete and consistent specification, and much of the essence of building a program is in fact the debugging of the specification.
 - Study after study shows that the very best designers produce structures that are faster, smaller, simpler, clearer, and produced with less effort. The differences between the great and the average approach an order of magnitude.
 - We tend to blame the physical media for most of our implementation difficulties; for the media are not “ours” in the way the ideas are, and our pride colors our judgement.
 - Software and hardware design is less different than software designers think, but more different than hardware designers think.
 - I am more convinced than ever. Conceptual integrity is central to product quality.
 - A little retrospection shows that although many fine, useful software systems have been designed by committees and built as part of multipart projects, those software systems that have excited passionate fans are those that are the products of one or a few designing minds, great designers.
 - Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.
 - Mediocre design provably wastes the world’s resources, corrupts the environment, affects international competitiveness. Design is important.
 - But I will argue that knowing complete product requirements up front is a quite rare exception, not the norm.
 - System debugging has always been a graveyard-shift occupation, like astronomy.
 - The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve, and never to act on problems when he is explicitly reviewing status.
 - There is no single development, in either technology or management technique, which by itself promises even one order-of-magnitude improvement within a decade in productivity, in reliability, in simplicity.
 - Consensus processes starve innovative design by eating the resource.
 - Software work is the most complex that humanity has ever undertaken.
 - A computer program is a message from a man to a machine. The rigidly marshaled syntax and the scrupulous definitions all exist to make intention clear to the dumb engine.
 - Design work doesn’t just satisfy requirements, it elicits them.
 - Systematically identity top designers as early as possible. The best are often not the most experienced.
 - Improving your process won’t move you from good to great design. It’ll move you from bad to average.
 - When a task cannot be partitioned because of sequential constraints, the application of more effort has no effect on the schedule. The bearing of a child takes nine months, no matter how many women are assigned.
 - The management question, therefore, is not whether to build a pilot system and throw it away. You will do that. Hence plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow.
