 - Our criminal justice system is fallible. We know it, even though we don’t like to admit it. It is fallible despite the best efforts of most within it to do justice. And this fallibility is, at the end of the day, the most compelling, persuasive, and winning argument against a death penalty.
 - The pace of global warming is accelerating and the scale of the impact is devastating. The time for action is limited – we are approaching a tipping point beyond which the opportunity to reverse the damage of CO2 emissions will disappear.

 - I don’t like politicians who vacillate.
 - It sucks. I used to be governor of New York.
 - In 2007, when I was governor of New York, I proposed that our state once again permit undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver’s license. To say the proposal lit a firestorm in the political arena is an understatement.

 - In politics you learn to always smile.
 - One of the biggest lies in capitalism is that companies like competition. They don’t. Nobody likes competition.
 - Power must be used, but it must be tempered by soul-searching and the recognition of our human capacity for error. That is the maxim that should inform our approach to every challenge, from reforming state government to engaging in foreign affairs.

 - I apologize to the public, whom I promised better.
 - Public speaking? I speak to myself on the street!
 - The Occupy movement needs an organizing principle, and – just as the Tea Party did – it needs some actual measures of success. Choose one candidate whose agenda is squarely within that of the movement and make his or her electoral success a focal point.
 - Why does it have to be politics? Is there a dynamism to that world and a theoretical capacity to do things that draws many talented people? Absolutely. Are there other ways to be involved and lead an interesting life? Of course.

 - When you’re in office, there are tangible moments when you can see tangible successes.

 - Virtually everywhere in the world, people still wake up and want their country to be more like the United States than any other nation.

 - I would say to those who don’t like the metaphor This is reality.
