 - The word ‘potential’ used to hang over me like a cloud.
 - Greg Maddux is probably the best pitcher in all of baseball along with Roger Clemens. He’s much more intelligent than I am because he doesn’t have a 95 or 98 mph fastball. I would tell any pitcher who wants to be successful to watch him, because he’s the true definition of a pitcher.
 - People who say they’re not nervous – I would be kind of curious to see how successful you are at what you do and how long you’ve done it. And what is success in your eyes? Have you separated yourself from everyone else in that craft? Or have you settled amongst the pack?
 - When you can throw 97 miles an hour and put the ball over the plate anytime you want, it’s fun.
