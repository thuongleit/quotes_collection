 - Art is a kind of illness.
 - I lived for art, I lived for love.
 - Inspiration is an awakening, a quickening of all man’s faculties, and it is manifested in all high artistic achievements.
 - See, the night doth enfold us! See, all the world lies sleeping!
 - I’m working, but there is so much still to be done! And it frightens me to think of my weight of years. But on we go, without fear or hesitation!
 - The work comes into the world at an undetermined hour, from a still unknown, but it comes inevitably.
