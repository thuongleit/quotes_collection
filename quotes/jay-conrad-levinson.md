 - Consistency breeds familiarity, familiarity breeds confidence, and confidence breeds sales.
 - Your website is the window of your business. Keep it fresh, keep it exciting.
 - In order to sell a product or a service, a company must establish a relationship with the consumer. It must build trust and rapport. It must understand the customer’s needs, and it must provide a product that delivers the promised benefits.

 - More than half your marketing time should be devoted to your existing customers.
 - There are two kinds of marketing: expensive and inexpensive. Expensive marketing is the kind that doesn’t work. Inexpensive marketing is the kind that works – regardless of cost.

 - Guerrilla marketing aims its message at individuals or, if it must be a group, the smaller the group, the better.

 - Guerrilla marketing requires you to comprehend every facet of marketing, experiment with many of them, winnow out the losers, double up on the winners, and then use the marketing tactics that prove themselves to you in the battleground of real life.
 - Marketing is every bit of contact your company has with anyone in the outside world. Every bit of contact. That means a lot of marketing opportunities. It does not mean investing a lot of money.
