 - Bring the past only if you are going to build from it.
 - Time is like the wind, it lifts the light and leaves the heavy.
 - To know when to go away and when to come closer is the key to any lasting relationship.
 - The man that shows off, to that one who wants to convince of his value is to himself.
 - Reason and faith are both banks of the same river.
 - If in the after life there is not music, we will have to import it.
