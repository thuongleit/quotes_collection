 - Do not look around at what everyone else is doing. No one is asking you to be someone else. But the world does need you to be you, because you are the only one who can do the job. Be the person God created you to be. He made you exactly right.
 - Take time to determine the way you will live your life. But once you know the way you should go, let nothing distract you from your path.
