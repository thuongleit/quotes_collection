 - The inner fire is the most important thing mankind possesses.
 - I donâ€™t create poetry, I create myself, for me my poems are a way to me.
 - My self-confidence comes from the fact that I have discovered my own dimensions. It does not behoove me to make myself smaller than I am.
 - Of all our sunny world, i wish only for a garden sofa where a cat is sunning itself.
