 - Bikers, in general, have just been so attractive to people. Photographers would follow them because there’s this weird warrior gravitas that comes with it. The bikes are loud, they have tattoos, they have artwork that they all wear on their jackets.
 - I don’t know. I always love to find where a character’s heart is, and by that I mean where they’re intrinsically vulnerable, and to bring that out in myself.
