 - I had been a feminist all my life, but the big problem was how to make your feminism jibe with you unappeasable hunger for male bodies.
 - Pleasure is terrifying because it breaks down the boundaries between people. Embracing passion means living with fear.

 - Why do analysts always answer a question with a question?
 - I thought of the nameless inventor of the bathtub. I was somehow sure it was a woman. And was the inventor of the bathtub plug a man?
 - I don’t necessarily read everything. I read what I need to read to inspire the book I’m trying to finish.

 - When I sit down at my writing desk, time seems to vanish. I think it’s a wonderful way to spend one’s life.
 - Solitude is un-American.
 - The trick is not how much pain you feel – but how much joy you feel. Any idiot can feel pain. Life is full of excuses to feel pain, excuses not to live, excuses, excuses, excuses.
 - Is a currency worth anything if no one wants it? We used to buy shoes in Italy. Remember?
 - Isn’t it our job to be appalled by our parents? Isn’t it every generation’s duty to be dismayed by the previous generation? And to assert that we are different – only to discover later that we are distressingly the same?

 - My generation of young female writers discovered that we could dictate the form and content of our own fiction.

 - I’ve kept journals at many times in my life starting from when I was about 13 or 14. But it’s boring and contrived to keep a journal every day. Better to write as the mood strikes.

 - It is the artists who make the true value of the world, though at times they may have to starve to do it. They are like earthworms, turning up the soil so things can grow, eating dirt so that the rest of us may eat green shoots.
 - True intimacy is rare and it depends on other things besides sex.
 - I don’t think that sex necessarily produces intimacy.

 - Love gives without taking.
 - Every country gets the circus it deserves. Spain gets bullfights. Italy the Church. America Hollywood.
 - When I’m sitting at the desk not being able to write line one, it’s silence and despair! It’s not so easy to put the pen to the legal pad or type the first sentence on the computer screen.
 - Each day that I don’t write I get more fragmented.
 - Faith is the Knowledge of the Heart, Logick the Knowledge of the Mind.
 - Many people today believe that cynicism requires courage. Actually, cynicism is the height of cowardice. It is innocence and open-heartednes s that requires the true courage – however often we are hurt as a result of it.

 - You’re not too fat; you’re just in the wrong country.

 - Courage is the only Magic worth having.
 - I believe that women should live for love, for motherhood and for intellect, and I believe we shouldn’t have to choose. And I believe that’s always been difficult for women, to express themselves intellectually, maternally, and passionately.

 - Women are individuals in parenting, and why not?
 - It is not surprising that Venice is known above all for mirrors and glass since Venice is the most narcissistic city in the world, the city that celebrates self-mirroring.

 - I know some good marriages-marriages where both people are just trying to get through their days by helping each other, being good to each other.
