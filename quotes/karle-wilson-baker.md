 - Today I have grown taller from walking with the trees.
 - Some days my thoughts are just cocoons – all cold, and dull, and blind, They hang from dripping branches in the grey woods of my mind; And other days they drift and shine – such free and flying things! I find the gold-dust in my hair, left by their brushing wings.
