 - One day, through the Rosary and the Scapular, Our Lady will save the world.
 - A man who governs his passions is master of his world. We must either command them or be enslaved by them. It is better to be a hammer than an anvil.
 - We must sow the seed, not hoard it.
 - Do not weep, for I shall be more useful to you after my death and I shall help you then more effectively than during my life.
