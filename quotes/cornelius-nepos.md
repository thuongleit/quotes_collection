 - After darkness comes the light.
 - Tasteful rather than expensive.
 - In friendship similarity of character has more weight than kinship.
 - No evil is great if it is the last.
 - So that he seemed not to relinquish life, but to leave one home for another.
 - Peace is obtained by war.
 - No government is safe unless fortified by goodwill.
 - The power is detested, and miserable the life, of him who wishes to be feared rather than to be loved.
