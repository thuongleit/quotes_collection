 - Habits form a second nature.
 - The form follows the function.
 - What nature does in the course of long periods we do every day when we suddenly change the environment in which some species of living plant is situated.
 - All knowledge that is not the real product of observation, or of consequences deduced from observation, is entirely groundless and illusory.
 - It is not always the magnitude of the differences observed between species that must determine specific distinctions, but the constant preservation of those differences in reproduction.
 - It is not enough to discover and prove a useful truth previously unknown, but that it is necessary also to be able to propagate it and get it recognized.
 - All known living bodies are sharply divided into two special kingdoms, based upon the essential differences which distinguish animals from plants, and in spite of what has been said, I am convinced that these two kingdoms do not really merge into one another at any point.
