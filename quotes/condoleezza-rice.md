 - Life is full of surprises and and serendipity. Being open to unexpected turns in the road is an important part of success.

 - What you know today can affect what you do tomorrow, but not what you did yesterday.
 - Education is transformational. It changes lives. That is why people work so hard to become educated and why education has always been the key to the American Dream, the force that erases arbitrary divisions of race and class and culture and unlocks every person’s God-given potential.
 - Well, there are many things, whenever you look back, that you would’ve done differently. We’re all human. We do our best at the time. I really wish that we had passed a comprehensive immigration bill because that would’ve really helped our country. We came close, but we couldn’t.
 - Today’s headlines and history’s judgement are not the same.

 - Your friends and your family, if you’re close to them, they won’t let you get too far from who you were or from who you are. And so I love staying close to people who’ve always known me. That’s probably the best leavening that you could possibly have.
 - Defeating Human Trafficking is a great moral calling of our time.
 - This is not 1968 and the invasion of Czechoslovakia, where Russia can threaten its neighbors, occupy a capital, overthrow a government, and get away with it. Things have changed.
 - The first Republican I knew was my father and he is still the Republican I most admire. He joined our party because the Democrats in Jim Crow Alabama of 1952 would not register him to vote. The Republicans did. My father has never forgotten that day, and neither have I.

 - The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly Saddam can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don’t want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.
 - I’m a great believer in the fact that as you get to know someone, it matters not what religious background they have, or what their nationality is, or where they came from. And I think that’s how Americans really do relate to each other on a personal level.

 - I’ve always said that I expected to grow up and get married like any nice southern girl, but the fact is you don’t get married in the abstract. You find someone that you’d like to be married to.

 - When you’re in government, of course, you have protection and you have people who are looking out for your wellbeing, but you can’t live in a state of fear. If you do, you’re not going to do your job very well and you’re going to give yourself high blood pressure, which probably isn’t worth it.
 - We’re in the middle of the transformation of a society that has handled its politics through repression to a society that will handle its politics through democratic institutions.

 - We can’t live true to our set of values unless American educational system is strong. I really believe that if we don’t get that right we will not compete because we won’t believe that our people can compete, and we’ll turn inward. We won’t lead. That will be bad for the world.
 - When I went off to college, I was expecting to be a concert musician. In music school I heard all of these kids who were just unbelievable. And I understand that you can be very, very good, but there’s something that separates very, very good from great, and I knew that I wasn’t great.
