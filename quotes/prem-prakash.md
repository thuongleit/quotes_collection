 - At the end of our lives we hope we will look back and, like an incense stick completely burned away, will have poured forth all our fragrance into the world.
 - Our stresses, anxieties, pains, and problems arise because we do not see the world, others, or even ourselves as worthy of love.
 - The world that we perceive is a reflection of our own states of mind and reveals our own level of consciousness.
