 - I really believe that we don’t have to make a trade-off between security and privacy. I think technology gives us the ability to have both.
 - You accept failure as a possible outcome of some of the experiments. If you don’t get failures, you’re not pushing hard enough on the objectives.

 - The problem we were struggling with within the closed market was what the incentive would be. You probably wouldn’t use dollars. But those are all questions that need to be explored.

 - It would be ideal if we could have an uncontrolled flow of information. But we realized you can’t do that.
