 - To dream the impossible dream, to reach the unreachable star!
 - Dream the impossible dream.
 - One man scorned and covered with scars still strove with his last ounce of courage to reach the unreachable stars; and the world was better for this. -Don Quixote.
 - And know if I’ll only be true to the glorious quest That my heart lies peaceful and calm When I’m laid to my rest.
