 - There was both love and despair in his voice. He was truly handicapped when it came to emotions, and falling in love hadn’t changed that...

 - He tasted each one of them. The raw power and majesty of Wrath. The vast strength of Rhage. The burning, protective loyalty of Phury. The cold savagery of Zsadist. The sharp cunning of Vishous.
 - A book unopened alters not the ink on it’s pages.

 - You are in a prison with no bars. I worry about you.
 - Man, life was complicated. But the truth was simple. He was her home. He was where she belonged.
 - I would hold you up. I will ever hold you up and hold you dear, lover mine.
 - I could take you down on this sidewalk and be up that skirt of yours in a heartbeat. And you wouldn’t fight me, would you? No, she probably wouldn’t. Wrath and Beth.

 - Butch didn’t live in his own place. He didn’t spend his own money. He had no job, no future. He was a well-kept pet, not a man.
 - She was seriously staring. Which was what you did when you got a gander at a man who is hung like a Louisville Slugger.
 - V shook his head. “Remember what you saw in that clearing, cop? How’d you like that anywhere near a female you loved?” Butch put down the Bud without drinking from it. His eyes traveled over Rhage’s body. “We’re going to need a shitload of steel,” the human muttered.
