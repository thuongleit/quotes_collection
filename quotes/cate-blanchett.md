 - Lazy thinking is not creative or productive.
 - See the opportunity in the misstep.
 - I don’t tell the truth, I tell what ought to be the truth.
 - I’m not focused on what other people think of me.
 - We change people’s lives, at the risk of our own. We change countries, governments, history, gravity. After gravity, culture is the thing that holds humanity in place, in an otherwise constantly shifting and, let’s face it, tiny outcrop in the middle of an infinity of nowhere.
 - Please, I need you to save my ass.
 - I think it’s always good to take on things that at first seem bigger than you. Then you just try and surmount them.
 - I remember when I was 26. My father died when I was young and my mother didn’t have a lot of money, so I thought, ‘I want to own a flat by the time I’m 26.’ So I worked towards that, literally trying to scrimp and save. But sometimes those plans don’t go as you expect.

 - The emoji still doesn’t really speak to the complexity that actually – or the subtext that goes on between when people actually speak face-to-face.
 - People talk about the golden age of Hollywood because of how women were lit then. You could be Joan Crawford and Bette Davis and work well into your 50s, because you were lit and made into a goddess. Now, with everything being sort of gritty, women have this sense of their use-by date.
 - I couldn’t possibly have played someone with feelings towards a woman unless I had those feelings myself.
 - I’ve an enormous respect for my mother who at the age of 39 raised three children, and I grew up with my grandmother in the household. And so it was a really strong household of women – my poor brother! It was great growing up with so many generations of women.
 - And perhaps, those of us in the industry who are still foolishly clinging to the idea that female films, with women at the center are niche experience, they are not. Audiences want to see them and, in fact, they earn money. The world is round, people.
 - A film is not a documentary. And what’s wonderful about film is that it’s a real provocation for people. I never, ever see film as being an absolute version of the truth.
 - I don’t think about being beautiful or not being beautiful. It’s more about feeling confident inside your own skin really and thinking about yourself as little as possible.
 - Women have been doing very, very strange things for centuries. I mean ancient Egyptians were already doing that, but I don’t necessarily judge people who do. I don’t really think it makes people look better; they just look different.
 - I think you’re peripatetic when you work in this industry. My husband and I are assuming the role of co-artistic directors at the Sydney Theatre Company in 2008. But as long as the film industry will have me, I will have it.
 - I think we should all feel lucky and blessed that people are still, in this day and age, getting in their cars with other people and driving to a location and paying money to sit in a theater and watch a play.
 - I look at someone’s face and I see the work before I see the person. I personally don’t think people look better when they do it; they just look different.
 - I’m not dressing for anyone else. I don’t really subscribe to other people’s idea of what is beautiful. I just want to feel good.
 - Of course one worries about getting older – we’re all fearful of death, let’s not kid ourselves. I’m simply not panicking as my laugh lines grow deeper. Who wants a face with no history, no sense of humor?
 - I think Pilates is great, especially when you can do it with a trainer who keeps you on track.
 - I’m the age I am, but my skin is in pretty good condition because I’ve been consistent with my skincare.
 - I like to put perfume on my pulse points, but I also love the way you can sense it – there is an atmosphere that comes from releasing a scent in to the world – it’s a primal thing. I spray around me, not just on me, and it lingers in the room after I leave.
 - It was only when I realized how actors have the power to move people that I decided to pursue acting as a career.

 - I went through a mod and goth-phase when I decided that I wouldn’t ever be the bronzed beach-bunny. I started going as pale as I possibly could.
 - Look, it’s one of the great mysteries of the world, I cannot answer that question. I think I’m vaguely blonde. To be perfectly frank, I don’t know.
 - Onscreen, babies and animals are my inspiration. They’re so alive and there and not messed up in the head the way I am.
 - I don’t have a sense of entitlement or that I deserve this. You’d be surprised at the lack of competition between nominees – I think a lot of it’s imposed from the outside. Can I have my champagne now?
 - It’s important to travel and move and have a continual set of experiences so you’ve got more to feed back into your work. For me, it’s a natural thing.
 - You can’t really watch a theater performance by yourself. You can watch a movie by yourself, though.
 - One of my favorite moments is onstage, when you see a dancer leap, and you think they’re flying, and then they fall. It’s that moment of suspension that you look for, and sometimes you get it and sometimes you don’t.
 - I think often women can feel isolated and feel like they get into a rut and don’t quite know how to get out of it.
 - I often have a few scents depending on if I’m playing a character. The character may be wearing a scent that perhaps I wouldn’t wear. We’ve all got different moods and ways we want to express ourselves; scent is a very powerful way to let people in to your secret life.
 - I’m not interested in saying what people should and shouldn’t do. It depends on how people feel about themselves. I suppose personally if you do anything out of fear or to mask who you are, then that’s a bit scary. You’ve got to work with what you got...
 - If you only exercise your soloist muscles, the other muscles quickly atrophy.
 - The thing I love about live performance the most, is that the doors are closed, the lights are turned down, and the audience has to be reverential to what’s happening onstage.
 - Oh god, I wish. I really wish. If I’m time-poor, which I usually am, that’s the first thing to go. And I know it shouldn’t be, I know I should be really regular, but I like to get it done as quickly as possible.
 - The less one can think about oneself, the more interesting and attractive one becomes.
 - It’s part of my job. You can’t play Veronica Guerin sounding like this. It just wouldn’t wash. But what I find fascinating about doing an accent – unless it’s a farce – is that it’s not slapped on.
 - The effect on the geo-cultural political map of Australia made by Gough Whitlam is so vast that wherever you stick the pin in, you get a wealth of Gough’s legacy.
 - Working with Martin Scorsese was an absolute minute-by-minute education without him ever being grandiose about it.
 - If you think about Audrey Hepburn, I think she became more beautiful when she stopped being an actress and started working with humanitarian campaigns. The more engaged you can become the more you can shed your self-consciousness.
 - I love theatre – it’s where I started – and I’ve directed a play myself. I’m not sure if I want to direct a film, but certainly, as an actress, I’m always thinking, ‘Surely this must be my last film.’
 - The word ‘circumnavigate’ is quite a beautiful word.
 - Audiences want to see them, and in fact, they earn money. The world is round, people.

 - There is not a lot of separation between work and home life.
 - I just don’t see myself as the heroine in my own narrative.
 - The notion of fate and destiny is a very Greek concept. Working in the theater you do think a lot about that, because as a storyteller you do think, ‘At what point was this always going to happen and what part have I got a hand in being able to change things?’
 - You can’t be trying to make a film that pleases all people, you know, so it’s not a concern of mine.
 - Theater is all about foyers and conversation and digesting what you’ve seen.
 - I’m not a big believer in linear paths. I would always have these sort of five-year plans and think, ‘Ok, I wouldn’t mind to try to get here in five years.’
 - I’ve reprised roles in the theatre, which is somehow more accepted, and where one can automatically go deeper and further into the role.
 - Inquiry and curiosity is really important in any profession, but definitely in what I do. And in parallel you also need to be confident enough to try things. So it’s a tricky thing sometimes to balance those two states.
 - I discovered early on that some performers live their life in order to act, so all their relationships are simply an experience that they can feed back into their work. Which I find vampiric.
 - I think the downside of the Internet is that speaking-or writing-has become the point in and of itself.

 - When you’re a performer, of course you want an audience, but it’s very, very different from courting fame.
 - I think good theaters are really important. They allow you to exist in a space with other people.
 - If you know why someone is doing what they’re doing, why they’re behaving the way they are, then that’s your job to reveal that, and often that’s situational. The storytelling does that, and then some of it’s your job as an actor to make that subtext come to life.
 - There’s not a long, entrenched tradition of theatergoing in Australia.
 - Absolutely, I think that is where a scent is so powerful because it harnesses our memory and our memory is a very emotional place. I do like the smell of excitement.
 - You have to surrender less when you see a film than when you go and see something live.
 - The more you do it, the more you learn to concentrate, as a child does, incredibly intensively and then you sort of have to relax. I remember the first film I did, the lead actor would in between scenes be reading a newspaper or sleeping and I’d think, ‘How can you do that?’
 - I’m not interested in playing characters who see the world through my prism. I think the journey of understanding any character is to see how they tick and how they differ from you.

 - You do get scrutinized in the digital age. You know they’re zooming in on every pore, which you’ve got to forget about.
 - It’s interesting when you get those roles, which seem like nothing on the page, and you kind of subvert them. It’s hard to say no.

 - My husband keeps me really honest.
 - What I love about the theater is that you know who you’re acting for: your audience. And the thing I find really hard in film is, you don’t. The audience is invisible. And we’re sitting there, hoping there’s other people out there.
