 - Libraries are what is best about us as a society: open, exciting, rich, informative, free, inclusive, engaging.

 - I think coexisting with another life form is a very rich experience. It’s why people keep plants and animals.
 - I didn’t want to talk, and I didn’t think dogs could solve my problems. But they were so uncritical and un-judgmental. Sometimes when you’re really blue, you don’t want to talk, but you want that sense of companionship. I certainly enjoy that with my beasts.
 - I don’t like hiking with convicts carrying machetes.
 - I wish I had coined the phrase ‘tyranny of choice,’ but someone beat me to it. The counterintuitive truth is that have an abundance of options does not make you feel privileged and indulged; too many options make you feel like all of them are wrong, and that you are wrong if you choose any of them.
 - Like writing, running is so much about mind over matter. There are times when you have to override the discomfort and keep pushing. That capacity to endure and then prevail is just amazing.

 - I suppose I do have one embarrassing passion- I want to know what it feels like to care about something passionately.

 - I love tearing things out of the ground. I love digging and discarding. I love pruning. In fact, I love pruning so much that I once gave myself carpal-tunnel syndrome because I attacked a trumpet vine with so much dedication.
 - In an interesting inversion of status, the reigning breed in the dog park these days is the really-oddball-unidentifiable-mixed-breed-mutt-found-wandering-the-street or its equivalent. The stranger the mutt the better; the more peculiar the circumstance of it coming into your life, the better.
 - One of my favorite activities as a teen-ager was to watch television over the phone with my best friend.
 - I would argue that it might be easier to endure loneliness than to endure the idea that you might disappear.
 - One of the very best reasons for having children is to be reminded of the incomparable joys of a snow day.

 - Orchid hunting is a mortal occupation.
 - I had forgotten how thrilling a snow day is until my son started school, and as much as he loves it, he swoons at the idea of a free day arriving unexpectedly, laid out like a gift.
 - My inspiration is really very simple: I’m struck by things that I want to know more about. I really do react just as a curious person: who is this person? What’s the story behind this situation? Why do people like this or dislike this thing?
 - I really believed that anything at all was worth writing about if you cared about it enough, and that the best and only necessary justification for writing any particular story was that I cared about it.

 - I would like to make sleeping my new hobby, except that I’m too tired, really, to have a hobby. But a girl can always dream.
 - I am unusually Halloween-attentive, because, as it happens, I was born on Halloween, so for me it has always been an occasion of great moment.
 - To my great surprise, Twitter is not housed in a silver pod that orbits Earth at supersonic speeds, vacuuming up and then dispersing digital bits of worldwide chitchat; it’s in a big, bland office building in downtown San Francisco, near a bowling alley and an Old Navy.
 - Human relationships used to be easy: you had friends, boy- or girlfriends, parents, children, and landlords. Now, thanks to social media, it’s all gone sideways.
 - I like the idea that people get engaged thinking about design, about creativity. I don’t see how it could possibly be bad.
 - Why, I wonder, should the popularity of a news story matter to me? Does it mean it’s a good story or just a seductive one?
 - College athletics are so entrenched and enjoyed by so many people that they will never be discontinued or substantially changed. I know that. I just pity the people caught in that tender trap. And most of all, I pity those kids.

 - Sometimes I think I’ve figured out some order in the universe, but then I find myself in Florida.
 - Every corny thing that’s said about living with nature – being in harmony with the earth, feeling the cycle of the seasons – happens to be true.
 - It seems that half the point of being in Miami Beach – particularly the northern end of South Beach – is to be observed by people-watchers like me, and the display along Ocean Drive during my visit was, as always, sublime.
 - Now we’re e-mailing and tweeting and texting so much, a phone call comes as a fresh surprise. I get text messages on my cell phone all day long, and it warbles to alert me that someone has sent me a message on Facebook or a reply or direct message on Twitter, but it rarely ever rings.
 - You have to simply love writing, and you have to remind yourself often that you love it.
 - There are cultures that believe having your photograph taken steals your soul. I don’t think there is a stolen soul in a picture, but still – why is it so hard to throw them away?
 - If you had really loved something, wouldn’t a little bit of it always linger?
 - When it comes to consumer electronics, I’m a big fat sucker, because even though I know you should never, ever buy anything until the second version of it is released, I just can’t resist. I live in a state of perpetual Beta.
 - Unlimited choice is paralyzing. The Internet has made this form of paralysis due to option overload a standard feature of comfortable modern life.
 - We do a lot of bird-watching up in the country, but we almost never have a chance to people-watch. There simply aren’t enough human beings up here: there is nowhere you can park yourself with a cup of coffee and observe the species on parade.
 - I’m happy to be reminded that an ordinary day full of nothing but nothingness can make you feel like you’ve won the lottery.
 - Dogs really are perfect soldiers. They are brave and smart; they can smell through walls, see in the dark, and eat Army rations without complaint.
 - Writers like to write, and writing in different forms – short, long, bite-sized, done on the fly, done with painstaking attention – all interest me.
 - When I still lived in Manhattan, people-watching was my hobby, and I spent many Sunday afternoons eating up the scene from a window seat at a Starbucks on Broadway.
 - Who on earth is going to use ‘utilize’ in a text message, a whopping seven characters including the always-hard-to-type ‘z,’ when you can say the exact same thing in three characters? I can’t think of a sentence in which ‘use’ can’t replace ‘utilize.’
 - I was never any good at remembering dates, but now I hardly have to. When the first bulb catalogs get delivered and the hens start laying again, that’s all the notice I’ll need to know that winter has passed.
 - I remember three- and four-week-long snow days, and drifts so deep a small child, namely me, could get lost in them. No such winter exists in the record, but that’s how Ohio winters seemed to me when I was little – silent, silver, endless, and dreamy.

 - It is hard to imagine Thomas Kinkade as anything less than supremely self-assured.
 - I finally overcame my phobia, and now I approach flying with a sort of studied boredom – a learned habit, thanks to my learn-to-fly-calmly training – but like all former flying phobics, I retain a weird and feverish fascination with aviation news, especially bad news.
 - I love Japanese design and fabrics. I also love people who make clothes for mass consumption but do it well and cleverly.
 - I wonder what book signings will be like when most of the books we read are electronic. Will authors sign something else? A flyer, perhaps? A special kind of card devised for the purpose?
 - Among all life forms, there are creatures with charisma and creatures without. It’s one of those ineffable qualities we can’t quite define, but we all seem to respond similarly to.
 - Borders had lousy management and made bad corporate decisions, so its fate is less like a terrible accident than a slow-motion slide into a ditch, but it’s hard to be happy about a bookseller’s demise.
 - States should pass laws making it illegal to own or trade wild animals; the phony ‘educational’ permits that many private owners have used to skirt those laws should be eliminated.
 - The lesson we have yet to learn from dogs, that could sustain us, is that having no apprehension of the past or future is not limiting but liberating.
 - There’s a marvelous sense of mastery that comes with writing a sentence that sounds exactly as you want it to.
 - I once had a boyfriend who couldn’t write unless he was wearing a necktie and a dress shirt, which I thought was really weird, because this was a long time ago, and no one I knew ever wore dress shirts, let alone neckties; it was like he was a grown-up reenacter or something.
 - There was a time when I kept track of it all; when my mind worked like a giant lint brush being swept over the fuzzy surface of popular culture. But these days, pop culture seems to have gotten fuzzier and fuzzier; notoriety comes and goes in the snap of a finger.
 - I have worked on PCs and on Macs and, while I have my preferences, I don’t find it crippling to work on one rather than the other.
 - Election Day outside of big cities is different. For one thing, there are so few people in my town that each individual vote really does matter, and several local races have been decided by as many votes as you can count on one hand.
 - There will always be vain, obsessive people who want to own rare and extraordinary things whatever the cost; there will always be people for whom owning beautiful, dangerous animals brings a sense of power and magic.

 - In the course of transferring all my CDs to my iPod, I have found myself wandering the musical hallways of my past and reacquainting myself with music I haven’t listened to in years.
 - I’ve definitely taken a lot of consolation from animals in my life. There have been times when I’ve been really sad, and they gave solace and comfort and companionability more than a person.
 - Being a good designer certainly doesn’t guarantee that you’re good at business. It’s probably more surprising when the two talents coexist in one person.
 - I love convincing a reader that an unusual or seemingly ordinary subject is worth his or her time – it’s part of the fun for me as a writer.
 - I approach stories as a private educational enterprise: I want to learn about something. I teach myself through research, reporting, and thinking, and then, when I feel like I know the story, I tell it to readers.

 - I went to a football school, which meant that I went to a university that served up education and was simultaneously operating a sports franchise.

 - Recently, I have come to assume that any call to my landline is from a telemarketer or an automated call from Terminex, letting me know that our regularly scheduled pest-extermination service will occur on its regular schedule. So I usually ignore my home phone.
 - Everything rational and sensible abandons me when I try to throw out photographs. Time and time again, I hold one over a wastebasket, and then find it impossible to release my fingers and let the picture drop and disappear.
 - I have no idea how to get in touch with anyone anymore. Everyone, it seems, has a home phone, a cell phone, a regular e-mail account, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and a Web site. Some of them also have a Google Voice number. There are the sentimental few who still have fax machines.

 - The first thing I think about when I wake up most mornings is the fact that I’m tired.

 - Keeping animals, I have learned, is all about water. Who even knew chickens drank water? I didn’t, but they do, and a lot.
 - I have long been one of those tedious people who rails against the coronation of ‘student-athletes.’ I have heard the argument that big-time athletics bring in loads of money to universities. I don’t believe the money goes anywhere other than back into the sports teams, but that’s another story.
 - What’s funny is that the idea of popularity – even the use of the word ‘popular’ – is something that had been mostly absent from my life since junior high. In fact, the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern.
