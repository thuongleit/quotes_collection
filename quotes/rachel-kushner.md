 - A lot of politics in art is just institutional critique, which, in my opinion, is not all that political.

 - I’m a very interior person. I love silence. I revel in it. I’m happy that way.
 - I am occasionally enraptured by Western landscape. But I don’t identify that state of mind as having to do with my own origins, having grown up in the West, although I certainly crisscrossed Nevada countless times growing up, and then as a young adult, in cars and on motorcycles.
 - There is no real appeal for me in an image of a woman on a motorcycle.
 - A funny thing about women and machines: the combination made men curious.
 - People are complicated. Personally I don’t go in for puritanical people.
 - The VW doesn’t make you think of Hitler and genocide. It’s a breast on wheels, a puffy little dream.

 - It’s really a misconception to identify the writer with the main character, given that the author creates all the characters in the book. In certain ways, I’m every character.
 - Every person has a range. In fiction, you get to be it all. I’m as much the men in my book as I am the women. I write how I write and there is no mission to stake a claim.
 - I am not a sun person at all. I think it’s a cancerous poison and I don’t want it touching me.
 - People who want their love easy don’t really want love.

 - In writing novels, you have to believe in yourself or there would be no way to sustain it. But you also have to give good evidence regularly for having that faith in self-either with quality goods or with, at least, “good efforts.” Working hard will do when inspiration is not forthcoming.
 - The kids I knew growing up who worked on bikes all loved the smell of gas. It is the liquid agent for speed.
 - Making art was really about the problem of the soul, of losing it. It was a technique for inhabiting the world. For not dissolving into it.
 - For me, truth cracks open in the places where things do not cohere. That’s how life is.
 - I don’t quite see the 20th century as one of chaos. But I believe in certain inevitable outcomes of a materialist nature.
 - I’d been listening to men talk since I arrived in New York City. That’s what men like to do. Talk. Profess like experts. When one finally came along who didn’t say much, I listened.
 - I shy away from plot structure that depends on the characters behaving in ways that are going to eventually be explained by their childhood, or by some recent trauma or event. People are incredibly complicated. Who knows why they are the way they are?
 - I begin a book with imagery, more than I do with an idea or a character. Some kind of poetic image.

 - I guess I’m not really fond of just chit-chatting. I want to learn something and have an experience.
 - When I see things in the world that leap out at me, I want to make use of them in fiction. Maybe every writer does that. It just depends on what you claim or appropriate as yours.
 - To be alive is to listen quietly while other people talk. That’s how you learn something.
 - I’m not belittling the art world. Not at all. I take it quite seriously, actually. But the logic of art is a vanguard logic that pressures art to incorporate the quotient of risk.
 - Eventually, I decided that if I was going to really write a novel, I couldn’t do it in New York City while holding down a job. You need a constant money source to live in New York City unless you’re independently wealthy, which I’m not.
 - Motorcycles aren’t about gaining agency, I don’t think.
 - I am interested in risk, in art as well as in the realm of politics.
 - I was very precocious when I was young. I went to college at 16, and I graduated at 20. I wanted to be a writer, but I was more interested in experience than in applying myself intellectually.
 - People who experience themselves as authentic are also experiencing themselves as myth, but that’s not the narrative they’re going with.
 - I didn’t think of the narrative as making a judgment. It didn’t occur to me the reader would either, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t possible there would be that risk.
 - Writing is a way of living. It doesn’t quite matter that there are too many books for the number of readers in the world to read them. It’s a way of being alive, for the writer.

 - Since it’s fiction, the book resonates, at least for me, on various levels, some of which intimate ideas about history but none of which have the kind of directly causal reasoning you cite.
