 - Life is not a race, but a journey to be savoured each step of the way. Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery and today is a gift. That’s why we call it the present.
 - Don’t give up when you still have something to give. Nothing is really over until the moment you stop trying.
 - Don’t undermine your worth by comparing yourself with others. It is because we are different that each of us is special.
 - Don’t shut love out of your life by saying it’s impossible to find time. The quickest way to receive love is to give; the fastest way to lose love is to hold it too tightly; and the best way to keep love is to give it wings.
 - Your life will always be filled with challenges. It’s best to admit this to yourself and decide to be happy anyway.
