 - Boy, does that give you street cred for years after, if you tell people you were on ‘The Larry Sanders Show!’

 - I think that by staying out of shape at the age of 33 I’m doing myself a huge favor for my future. There will never be anyone commenting on how I’ve ‘let myself go.’ I’ve gone. It’s gone. It’s not going, it’s GONE.
 - The media is supposed to be custodians of the facts and watchdogs of government. They have, for the most part, neglected to be either of those things.

 - Granted, not really a joke, but how often do you get a mic in your hand? You know? So. I am sorry but don’t anybody trip on my soap box on the way out. Don’t anybody trip over that. And the chip on my shoulder’s a little heavy. I have back problems now.
