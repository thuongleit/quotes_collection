 - I’m a fighter by nature and nothing will ever change that.
 - My will, my faith and my body have been challenged, but make no mistake, my heart is strong and my resolve to fight will never be broken.
 - Once someone asked me three words that best describe me and I said ‘Loud, Louder, and Loudest.’
 - I wear glasses, have a big scar, I sing loud, and I am blond. I’m sorry!
 - You know later in life I was inspired to sing and that would’ve been Aretha, Chaka Khan, Mariah – the typical divas were the inspiration. I’ve always enjoyed all those singers.
