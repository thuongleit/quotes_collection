 - There is no excellence in archery without great labour.
 - But you must be patient and careful; nor should you expect to become an accomplished archer without long and severe training.
 - So long as the new moon returns in heaven a bent, beautiful bow, so long will the fascination of archery keep hold in the hearts of men.
