 - The great lesson about filmmaking is never take “no” for an answer, especially if you have a lot of passion and inspiration to do something.
 - The holy trifecta of directing and filmmaking is character emotion, camera movement and music. When you hit those three, that’s magical. That’s what I’m trying to do.
 - That’s the most beautiful thing that I like about boxing: you can take a punch. The biggest thing about taking a punch is your ego reacts and there’s no better spiritual lesson than trying to not pay attention to your ego’s reaction.

 - Life just happens the way it’s supposed to happen. It delivers you to where it delivers you.
 - The whole trick is to make it feel like you’re spying on real people’s lives as they get through the day. When I’m writing, I have to trick myself as a writer.

 - Gay marriage is a complete red herring to distract everyone from the economy and the war and health care and education.
 - I think any spiritual experience that’s worthwhile is not about ego and it will humble you in some way. And also, a Zen monk once said to me, ‘If you’re not laughing, then you’re not getting it.’
 - And that is also what the movie’s about, going beyond success, what is success ’cause I think success is misperceived as just a cake and it isn’t. There is many things inside that success. There’s a maturity and a heartbreak and sadness and broken glass.
 - The Fighter was about a family struggling to overcome and fighting each other sometimes, and I went back and rewrote this script which I had written for my son initially because my son has mood disorder.
 - Quite frankly, the bible is filled with advice that you’d never, want to follow. “Don’t cut your hair on a rainy Thursday because locusts will eat your farm” kind of thing.

 - The cinema that I make is a cinema about people, emotion, humanity and passion. It’s not just about what they struggle through, but what they live for. That’s what I love. The music they love, the people they love, the clothing, the hair and the life that they love.
 - David O. Russell’s best films are thrilling high wire acts that run the moment to moment risk of tumbling to the ground. In his latest, “Joy,” Russell has more trouble than usual keeping his balance on the wire.
 - A thousand years ago, scientists who wondered about consciousness and the nature of reality were burned at the stake. We still haven’t recovered from that and it’s left us with a culture that no longer investigates consciousness, except on the fringes.
 - And if you can come through that and still have some connection to your joy you felt when you were a child that’s a very mature kind of a joy that I find inspiring. And Jennifer Lowrence has all that in her, and I’ve watched her have to go through it even in the last few years.

 - I suppose what I like about Zen is that the teachers are constantly questioning your insight and challenging it, looking for sloppiness or laziness in it, and ways you can go past that.
 - I make every movie and every scene like it could be my last. That’s the only way I know how to make cinema that stands on its feet. I have to treat it like that. It has to be life and death stakes.
 - There’s nothing better than having a collaborator that you have a great shorthand with and a great comfort with who’s shepherding the project along. I mean, that’s the best thing that can happen in cinema where there’s many cooks in the kitchen.

 - I got put on jury duty, which is where I learned how to write.
 - The idea that anyone would think their religious ideas make them morally superior is just preposterous.
 - You should always make it like it’s your last film. That’s my personal belief. Every filmmaker is going to have another belief. That’s the only way I know to try to make a film that might be good. You got to take it real seriously like it’s your last thing.
 - The endings for all my characters seem sufficiently human and messy for me to feel comfortable with them. In some ways they have only moved an inch, but sometimes an inch is a great distance.
 - When I write an email where I outlined a whole scene, it just came out of my unconscious, it comes from a deeper place. The same thing happens when the actors go, take after take, and just get lost in it. When you’re in a house, you don’t think about being in the house; you’re just there.
 - The religion itself may have some great ideas, but I can’t take it seriously if it’s blatantly exclusionary.
 - I would say that when I came into this chapter of my filmmaking career, starting with ‘The Fighter,’ there was this sense that you have to go from your instincts and you have to go from your gut, and you have to not hesitate and you have to not hedge.

 - Unhappy endings can be as cheap as happy endings.
 - If something – if you have a good rapport then you’re friends and you’re offered projects together or you discover stories together. Jennifer and I discovered this story together, and it was evident to us we would only do it with each other.
 - I did a dance sequence in my second short film, which was my best short film, called ‘Hairway to the Stars,’ and I think Chris Wink, the founder of Blue Man Group, was in that. It’s a black-and-white dance sequence. We were Glorious Food waiters together.
 - One of the things I’ve discovered at my age is I must have enchantment. And that was not clear to me in my earlier years. When I look at my favorite films, the Frank Capra – even Scorsese, even ‘Goodfellas,’ what makes that movie so remarkable is there’s enchantment in their world.
