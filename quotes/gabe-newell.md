 - Valve wouldn’t have gotten its start.
 - Ninety percent of games lose money; 10 percent make a lot of money. And theres a consistency around the competitive advantages you create, so if you can actually learn how to do the art, the design, and the programming, you would be consistently very profitable.
 - One of the things that’s interesting is that the PC has always had a huge amount of scalability. It was sort of the wild dog that moved into Australia and killed all the local life because it could just adapt. There used to be these dedicated devices, like dedicated word processors.
 - Everybody understands that you’re supposed to say ‘our employees are our most valuable asset’ to the point where, even if it’s really true, they’re not going to really trust you until you’ve earned that – same with customers.
 - I think that Windows 8 is kind of a catastrophe for everybody in the PC space.
 - George Lucas should have distributed the ‘source code’ to Star Wars. Millions of fans would create their own movies and stories. Most of them would be terrible, but a few would be genius.
 - Greenlight is a bad example of an election process. We came to the conclusion pretty quickly that we could just do away with Greenlight completely, because it was a bottleneck rather than a way for people to communicate choice.
 - The culture at Valve is pretty much crowdsourced. The handbook is a wiki. One of the first things we say to new hires is, ‘You have to change something in the handbook.’

 - I’d like to thank Sony for their gracious hospitality, and for not repeatedly punching me in the face. If I seem a little nervous, it’s because Kevin Butler was introduced to me backstage as the VP of sharpening things.
 - I think margins will be destroyed for a bunch of people. If that’s true, then it will be good to have alternatives to hedge against that eventuality.
 - Steam is about creating tools for content creators and customers.
 - About half the people at Valve have run their own companies, so they always have the option not just to take a job at another game company, but to go start their own company. The question you always have to answer is, ‘How are we making these people more valuable than they would be elsewhere?’
 - If you look at the requirements for just one piece, like art, from one generation of games to the next, it will change radically. You need people who are adaptable because the thing that makes you the best in the world in one generation of games is going to be totally useless in the next.
 - A store is just a collection of content. The Steam store is this very safe, boring entertainment experience. Nobody says, ‘I’m going to play the Steam store now.’
 - As somebody who participates in the overall PC ecosystem, it’s totally great when faster wireless networks and standards come out or when graphics get faster. Windows 8 was like this giant sadness. It just hurts everybody in the PC business.

 - I consider Apple to be very closed. Let’s say you have a book business, and you are charging 5 to 7 percent gross margins; you can’t exist in an Apple world because they want 30 percent, and they don’t care that you only have 7 percent to play with.
 - Traditional credentialing really doesn’t have a lot of predictive value to if people will be successful.
 - One of the things that’s important about family is the narrative history they create for themselves.

 - Photoshop should be a free-to-play game. There’s not really a difference between very traditional apps and how they enhance productivity and wandering around a forest and killing bears.
 - I think it’s highly likely that we’ll continue to have high-performance graphics capability in living rooms. I’m not sure we’re all going to put down our game controllers and pick up touch screens – which is a reasonable view, I’m just not sure I buy into it.
 - The Internet is changing what entertainment and sports is. It’s not just a few people authoring an experience for others. It’s really growing out of what everybody does.
 - I remember back in the early days of Microsoft that from the day that you decided that you were just going to put out an ad to a customer – and all you were usually able to tell them was that a new product was available – it was about nine months before you could actually reach the first customer.
 - If you look at a multi-player game, it’s the people who are playing the game who are often more valuable than all of the animations and models and game logic that’s associated with it.
 - If I buy a game on Steam and I’m running it on Windows, I can go to one of the Steam machines and already have the game. So you benefit as a developer; you benefit as a consumer in having the PC experience extended in the living room.
