 - For 35 years, I was a writer. I wrote a lot of jokes. Some of them weren’t funny. Some of them weren’t appropriate. Some of them were downright offensive. I understand that.
 - Technology is an incredible tool – it connects people to each other, creates jobs all over the world, and makes life easier for millions of Americans.
 - My parents didn’t make a lot of money. My dad was not a high school graduate – he didn’t have a career as such; he was a printing salesman essentially for most of his working life.

 - The nature of the Internet and the importance of net neutrality is that innovation can come from everyone.
 - Whining is anger through a small opening.

 - If I put myself on the ballot and even 50 people voted for me, it’d be a travesty.
 - I think Hell exists on Earth. It’s a psychological state, or it can be a physical state. People who have severe mental illness are in Hell. People who have lost a loved one are in Hell. I think there are all kinds of different hells. It’s not a place you go to after you die.
 - The biases the media has are much bigger than conservative or liberal. They’re about getting ratings, about making money, about doing stories that are easy to cover.
 - Teen pregnancy went way down in the ’90s, and 75 percent of it was because of increased use of contraception.

 - Bill Clinton is the greatest president of the 20th century because I played touch football with him.
 - The crash of 2008 was driven in no small part by unfair practices in the mortgage industry, which led to many consumers becoming trapped in loans they didn’t understand and couldn’t afford.
 - I’m part of the mushball middle. I consider ‘confused’ the majority position because, thankfully, most people would rather be uncertain some of the time than 100% positive all the time – even when they’re wrong.
 - I’m a bit of a shill for the Clinton Administration, which has its perks. I’m invited to all the inaugural balls.
 - Terrorism, to me, is the use of terror for political purpose, and terror is indiscriminate murder of civilians to make a political point.
 - Net neutrality isn’t a government takeover of the Internet, as many of my Republican colleagues have alleged.

 - If you hear, day after day, liberals are rooting against armed forces, that is eventually going to have an effect on soldiers and troops who are actually going to believe that and it’s wrong. It’s just wrong.

 - I got interested in politics during the civil rights movement and then Vietnam.
 - I am a Minnesotan, and not just because I root for the Vikings and the Twins. I like the Minnesota-nice sensibility. I like the liberal tradition; I like the Hubert Humphrey tradition fighting for civil rights.

 - Progressives, in a way, are the new conservatives. We want to conserve what we fought to build.

 - Comedy to the Senate? Well, there certainly hasn’t been a satirist or a political satirist who’s done that. So, that really was uncharted territory during the campaign. But I think it’s a good thing. Some people thought that it was an odd career arc, but to me it made absolute sense.
