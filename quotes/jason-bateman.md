 - Our job, as actors, is to just try to be as accurate and as mindful of what the audience is going through and receiving and processing. If it’s a situation where the character should look a little bit out of control or do something stupid, it’s your job to act into that, in a believable way.

 - Will Arnett is one of the funniest guys I know. He has seen it all and done it all and come out the other end pretty savvy and pretty strong.
