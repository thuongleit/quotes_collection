 - The race belongs not only to the swift and strong but to those who keep on running.
 - Have a dream, make a plan, go for it. You’ll get there, I promise.
 - Either you have your dreams or you live your dreams.
 - Either you have dreams or you live your dreams. I’m not all that remarkable. I just keep putting one foot in front of the other until I get to where I have to go.
