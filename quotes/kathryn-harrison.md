 - We’re taught to expect unconditional love from our parents, but I think it is more the gift our children give us. It’s they who love us helplessly, no matter what or who we are.
 - Scars are stories, history written on the body.
 - For me, writing is inseparable from thinking. I could say the entire undertaking is a vast cerebral construct against my demons. It’s the thing that I love. It’s my identity.
 - Don’t portray yourself as who you want to be. Portray yourself as who you are.
 - The dizzy rapture of starving. The power of needing nothing. By force of will I make myself the impossible sprite who lives on air, on water, on purity.
 - My days are as long as despair can make them.
