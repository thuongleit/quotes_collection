 - To achieve your ethereal state, you have to expand your thoughtless awareness.
 - Let somebody insult you and see that that you do not answer back. Just see it, not to get into temper. Try that your ego doesn’t react. That can be achieved very easily if you try in the mirror, look at yourself and laugh at yourself, make fun of yourself.
 - Innately within us, resides the Spirit which wants to enlighten you, to give the peace, the bliss and the joy of our being.

 - Truth is in your sahasrara. And when the truth comes in, you are surprised that truth is love and love is truth, pure love.
