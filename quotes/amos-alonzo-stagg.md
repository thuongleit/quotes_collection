 - Is this my best team ever? I won’t know that for another 20 years or so.
 - Winning isn’t worthwhile unless one has something finer and nobler behind it. When I reach the soul of one of my boys with an idea, or ideal, or vision, then I have done my job as a coach.
 - Winning isn’t worthwhile unless one has something finer and nobler behind it.
 - I pray not for victory, but to do my best.
 - No man is too good to be the athletic coach for youth.
