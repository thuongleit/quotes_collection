 - Man proposes, and God disposes.
 - Nature made him, and then broke the mold.
 - When the devil grows old he turns hermit.
 - For rarely man escapes his destiny.
 - Cruelty ever proceeds from a vile mind, and often from a cowardly heart.
 - I regret not death. I am going to meet my friends in another world.
 - Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.
 - From heresy, frenzy and jealousy, good Lord deliver me.
