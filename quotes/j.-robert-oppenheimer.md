 - The best way to send information is to wrap it up in a person.
 - It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they are found because it was possible to find them.
 - We do not believe any group of men adequate enough or wise enough to operate without scrutiny or without criticism. We know that the only way to avoid error is to detect it, that the only way to detect it is to be free to inquire. We know that in secrecy error undetected will flourish and subvert.
 - When you see something that is technically sweet you go ahead and do it.
 - Pragmatism is an intellectually safe but ultimately sterile philosophy.
 - Both the man of science and the man of action live always at the edge of mystery, surrounded by it.

 - A pragmatist is concerned with results, not reality.
 - No man should escape our universities without knowing how little he knows.
 - The open society, the unrestricted access to knowledge, the unplanned and uninhibited association of men for its furtherance-these are what may make a vast, complex, ever growing, ever changing, ever more specialized and expert technological world, nevertheless a world of human community.
 - To the confusion of our enemies.
 - Science is not everything, but science is very beautiful.
 - There are children playing in the streets who could solve some of my top problems in physics, because they have modes of sensory perception that I lost long ago.
 - It is perfectly obvious that the whole world is going to hell. The only possible chance that it might not is that we do not attempt to prevent it from doing so.
 - The most beautiful philosophical song existing in any known tongue.
 - When we deny the EVIL within ourselves, we dehumanize ourselves, and we deprive ourselves not only of our own destiny but of any possibility of dealing with the EVIL of others.
 - Truth, not a pet, is man’s best friend.
 - I can’t think that it would be terrible of me to say – and it is occasionally true – that I need physics more than friends.
 - We may be likened to two scorpions in a bottle, each capable of killing the other, but only at the risk of his own life.
 - There is something irreversible about acquiring knowledge; and the simulation of the search for it differs in a most profound way from the reality.
 - When you see something that is technically sweet, you go ahead and do it and you argue about what to do about it only after you have had your technical success. That is the way it was with the atomic bomb.
 - Access to the Vedas is the greatest privilege this century may claim over all previous centuries.
 - You can certainly destroy enough of humanity so that only the greatest act of faith can persuade you that what’s left will be human.
 - There must be no barriers for freedom of inquiry. There is no place for dogma in science. The scientist is free, and must be free to ask any question, to doubt any assertion, to seek for any evidence, to correct any errors.
 - We hunger for nobility: the rare words and acts that harmonize simplicity and truth.
 - The physicists have known sin; and this is a knowledge which they cannot lose.
 - Maybe General Groves was right. Maybe we should just banish thinking forever.
 - The theory of our modern technic shows that nothing is as practical as theory.

 - We do not believe any group of men adequate enough or wise enough to operate without scrutiny or without criticism.
 - The history of science is rich in example of the fruitfulness of bringing two sets of techniques, two sets of ideas, developed in separate contexts for the pursuit of new truth, into touch with one another.
 - Things which stimulate my curiosity are pretty far removed from the practical and therefore from classification.
 - Taken as a story of human achievement, and human blindness, the discoveries in the sciences are among the great epics.
 - If atomic bombs are to be added as new weapons to the arsenals of a warring world, or to the arsenals of nations preparing for war, then the time will come when mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima. The people must unite, or they will perish.
 - All history teaches us that these questions that we think the pressing ones will be transmuted before they are answered, that they will be replaced by others, and that the very process of discovery will shatter the concepts that we today use to describe our puzzlement.
 - Discovery follows discovery, each both raising and answering questions, each ending a long search, and each providing the new instruments for a new search.
 - When all thermonuclear sources of energy are exhausted a sufficiently heavy star will collapse. Unless fission due to rotation, the radiation of mass, or the blowing off of mass by radiation, reduce the star’s mass to the order of that of the sun, this contraction will continue indefinitely.
 - In the material sciences these are and have been, and are most surely likely to continue to be heroic days.
 - The greatest of the changes that science has brought is the acuity of change; the greatest novelty the extent of novelty.

 - It is proper to the role of the scientist that he not merely find new truth and communicate it to his fellows, but that he teach, that he try to bring the most honest and intelligible account of new knowledge to all who will try to learn.
 - In a free world, if it is to remain free, we must maintain, with our lives if need be, but surely by our lives, the opportunity for a man to learn anything.
 - Today, it is not only that our kings do not know mathematics, but our philosophers do not know mathematics and – to go a step further – our mathematicians do not know mathematics.
