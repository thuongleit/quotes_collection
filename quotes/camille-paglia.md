 - Modernization means Westernization.
 - Feminism has tried to dismiss the femme fatale as a misogynist libel, a hoary cliche. But the femme fatale expresses woman’s ancient and eternal control of the sexual realm. The specter of the femme fatale stalks all of men’s relationships with women.
 - A woman simply is, but a man must become.
 - We cannot have a world where everyone is a victim. “I’m this way because my father made me this way. I’m this way because my husband made me this way.” Yes, we are indeed formed by traumas that happen to us. But you must take charge, you must take over, you are responsible.
 - Promiscuity in men may cheapen love but sharpen thought. Promiscuity in women is illness, a leakage of identity.
 - Every man must define his identity against his mother. If he does not, he just falls back into her and is swallowed up.
 - Heterosexual love,. is in sync with cosmic forces. Not everyone has the stomach for daily war with nature.
 - Male urination really is a kind of accomplishment, an arc of transcendance. A woman merely waters the ground she stands on.
 - The last western society to worship female powers was Minoan Crete. And significantly, that fell and did not rise again.
 - If civilization had been left in female hands we would still be living in grass huts.
 - The Devil is a woman.

 - My anti-liberal position should not be mistaken for conservatism...
 - Rule of art: Cant kills creativity!
 - Men have sacrificed and crippled themselves physically and emotionally to feed, house, and protect women and children. None of their pain or achievement is registered in feminist rhetoric, which portrays men as oppressive and callous exploiters.
 - What feminism calls patriarchy is simply civilization, an abstract system designed by men but augmented and now co-owned by women.
 - Men know they are sexual exiles. They wander the earth seeking satisfaction, craving and despising, never content. There is nothing in that anguished motion for women to envy.
 - What troubles me about the “hostile workplace” category of sexual harassment policy is that women are being returned to their old status of delicate flowers who must be protected from assault by male lechers. It is anti-feminist to ask for special treatment for women.
 - In the real world, very smart people fail and mediocre people rise. Part of what makes people fail or succeed are skills that have nothing to do with IQ. Also, the idea that intelligence can be gauged by an IQ test is erroneous.
 - If men are obsolete, then women will soon be extinct – unless we rush down that ominous Brave New World path where women clone themselves by parthenogenesis, as famously do Komodo dragons, hammerhead sharks, and pit vipers.
 - Imperialism and slavery are no white male monopoly, but are everywhere from Egypt, Assyria, and Persia to India, China and Japan.
 - Male aggression and lust are the energizing factors in culture. They are men’s tools of survival in the pagan vastness of female nature.
 - Foucault is the Cagliostro of our time.
 - Social justice and compassion are compatible with an intelligent respect for private enterprise and law and order.
 - Madonna is the true feminist. She exposes the puritanism and suffocating ideology of American feminism, which is stuck in an adolescent whining mode. Madonna has taught young women to be fully female and sexual while still exercising control over their lives.
 - Men knew that if they devirginized a woman, they could end up dead within twenty-four hours. These controls have been removed.
 - Cinema is the culmination of the obsessive, mechanistic male drive in western culture. The movie projector is an Apollonian straight-shooter, demonstrating the link between aggression and art. Every pictorial framing is a ritual limitation, a barred precinct.
 - Women’s studies is a comfy, chummy morass of unchallenged groupthink. It is, with rare exception, totally unscholarly. Academic feminists have silenced men and dissenting women.
 - Greek pederasty honored the erotic magnetism of male adolescence in a way that today brings police to the door. Children are more conscious and perverse than parents like to think.
 - Hollywood movies of the Fifties, like The Ten Commandments and Ben-Hur, with their epic clash of pagan and Judeo-Christian cultures, tell more about art and society than the French-infatuated ideologues who have made a travesty of the best American higher criticism.
 - Young feminists have been sold a bill of goods about American feminism. The enormous changes in women over the past 40 years are constantly and falsely attributed to the organized women’s movement of the late 1960s and ’70s.
 - Women are not in control of their bodies; nature is. Ancient mythology, with its sinister archetypes of vampire and Gorgon, is more accurate than feminism about the power and terror of female sexuality.
 - The female body is a chthonian machine, indifferent to the spirit who inhabits it.
 - Patriarchy, routinely blamed for everything, produced the birth control pill, which did more to free contemporary women than feminism itself.
 - Academic Marxism is a fantasy world, and unctuous compassion-sweepstakes, into which real workers or peasants never penetrate.
 - Society is an artificial construction, a defense against nature’s power.
 - Children are monsters of unbridled egotism and will, for they spring directly from nature, hostile intimations of immorality.
 - Nothing is more hackneyed than the liberal dogma that shock value confers automatic importance on an artwork.
 - Pursuit and seduction are the essence of sexuality. It’s part of the sizzle.
 - All men even, I have written, Jesus Christ began as flecks of tissue inside a woman’s womb. Every boy must stagger out of the shadow of a mother goddess, whom he never fully escapes.
 - The Gothic tradition was begun by Ann Radcliffe, a rare example of a woman creating an artistic style.
 - If someone offends you by speech, you must learn to defend yourself by speech.
 - Even a woman of abnormal will cannot escape her hormonal identity.
 - In the theory of gender I began from zero. There is no masculine power or privilege I did not covet. But slowly, step by step, decade by decade, I was forced to acknowledge that even a woman of abnormal will cannot escape her hormonal identity.
 - I respect the astute and rigorously unsentimental David Horowitz as one of America’s most original and courageous political analysts. He has the true 1960s spirit – audacious and irreverent, yet passionately engaged and committed to social change.
 - What is pretty in nature is confined to the thin skin of the globe upon which we huddle. Scratch that skin, and nature’s daemonic ugliness will erupt.
 - The moment there is imagination there is myth.
 - All objects, all phases of culture are alive. They have voices. They speak of their history and interrelatedness. And they are all talking at once!
 - Ballet is the body rising. Ballet is ceremonial and hieratic. Its disdain for the commonplace material world is the source of its authority and glamour.
 - Minerva save us from the cloying syrup of coercive compassion!
 - It’s so tiring to make love to women, it takes forever. I’m too lazy to be a lesbian.
 - Simply follow nature, Rousseau declares. Sade, laughing grimly, agrees.
 - Hollywood, America’s greatest modern contribution to world culture, is a business, a religion, an art form, and a state of mind.
 - Working moms commonly testify that they feel guilty when they are away from their children and guilty when they are not at their jobs. Devoted fathers certainly miss their children deeply, but it does not seem to be with the same gnawing, primal anxiety that often afflicts women.
 - A society that forgets about art risks loslng its soul.
 - The Dionysian is no picnic.
 - I regard affirmative action as pernicious-a system that had wonderful ideals when it started but was almost immediately abused for the benefit of white middle-class women.
 - What I see is not a world of male oppression and female victimization, but an internation conspiracy by women to keep from men the knowledge of men’s own frailty. A strange maternal protectiveness is at work.
 - Human life began in flight and fear. Religion rose from rituals of propitiation, spells to lull the punishing elements.
 - The mystique of the femme fatale cannot be perfectly translated into male terms.
 - Masculinity is risky and elusive. It is achieved by a revolt from woman, and it is confirmed only by other men. Manhood coerced into sensitivity is no manhood at all.
 - Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.
 - Television is actually closer to reality than anything in books. The madness of TV is the madness of human life.
 - How many modern transsexuals are unacknowledged shamans? Perhaps it is to poets they should go for counsel, rather than surgeons.
 - Western science is a product of the Apollonian mind: its hope is that by naming and classification, by the cold light of intellect, archaic night can be pushed back and defeated.
 - Elegance is reduction, simplification, condensation. It is spare, stark, sleek. Elegance is cultivated abstraction. The source of Greek and Roman classicism – clarity, order, proportion, balance – is in Egypt.
 - Education has become a prisoner of contemporaneity. It is the past, not the dizzy present, that is the best door to the future.
 - The smouldering eroticism of great European actresses like Jeanne Moreau demonstrated to my generations women’s archetypal mystery and glamour, completely missing from the totalitarian world-view of the misogynist Foucault. For me, the big French D is not Derrida, but Deneuve.
 - Much violence against women originates in emotional territory that they already command. By midlife and early old age, as the hormones of both genders change, women are in total, despotic control of their marriages.
 - The reform of a college English department cuts no ice down at the corner garage.
 - When feminist discourse is unable to discriminate the drunken fraternity brother from the homicidal maniac, women are in trouble.
 - When I was a child, my father taught me to put up my fists like a boy and to be prepared to defend myself at all times.
 - I cannot be convinced that great artists are moralists. Art is first appearances, then meaning.
 - Your life is a Fellini film, lacking only Anita Ekberg with a cat on her head.
 - The most successful prostitutes are invisible, because the sign of a prostitute’s success is her absolute blending with the environment. She’s so shrewd, she never becomes visible. She never gets in trouble. She has command of her life, and her clients.
 - Homeric mind is ingenuity, practical intelligence. There is no Rodin-like deep thinking, no mathematical or philosophical speculation. Odysseus thinks with his hands.
 - Woman’s sexuality is disruptive of the dully mechanical workaday world, in which efficiency means uniformity. The problems of woman’s entrance into the career system spring from more than male chauvinism. She brings nature into the social realm, which may be too small to contain it.
 - The thrill of terror is passive, masochistic, and implicitly feminine. It is imaginative submission to overwhelming superior force.
 - Teenage boys, goaded by their surging hormones run in packs like the primal horde. They have only a brief season of exhilarating liberty between control by their mothers and control by their wives.
 - Men chase by night those they will not greet by day.
 - I admire hard-bitten, wisecracking realism of Ida Lupino and the film noir heroines. I’m sick of simpering white girls with their princess fantasies.
 - Every man harbors an inner female territory ruled by his mother, from whom he can never entirely break free.
 - We must accept our pain Change what we can and laugh at the rest.
 - Cats are autocrats of naked self-interest.
 - Women’s studies needed a syllabus and so invented a canon overnight. It puffed up clunky, mundane contemporary women authors into Oz-like, skywriting dirigibles. Our best women students are being force-fed an appalling diet of cant, drivel and malarkey.
 - Perhaps there is no greater issue facing contemporary women than the choices they must make about balancing home and work.
 - Last time I checked, there were no Americans at all in Renaissance art.
 - The stigma of the prostitute is the badge of her identity. That is why the client goes to her. If he wanted someone without a stigma, he’d go and screw the lady next door.
 - Beauty is our weapon against nature; by it we make objects, giving them limit, symmetry, proportion. Beauty halts and freezes the melting flux of nature.
 - The airheads of Congress will keep their own plush healthcare plan – it’s the rest of us guinea pigs who will be thrown to the wolves.
 - Visionary idealism is a male art form. The lesbian aesthete does not exist. But if there were one, she would have learned from the perverse male mind.
 - The 1990s, after the reign of terror of academic vandalism, will be a decade of restoration: restoration of meaning, value, beauty, pleasure, and emotion to art and restoration of art to its audience.
 - Science is a method of logical analysis of nature’s operations. It has lessened human anxiety about the cosmos by demonstrating the materiality of nature’s forces, and their frequent predictability.
 - The followers of Derrida are pathetic, snuffling in French pockets for bits of pieces of a deconstructive method already massively and coherently presented and with a mature sense of the sacred in Buddhism and Hinduism.
 - Music never dies. Do we really need another Madonna tour? Does she have to compete with women performers 25 years her junior?
 - Freud says, Man fears that his strength will be taken from him by woman, dreads becoming infected with her femininity and then proving himself a weakling. Masculinity must fight off effeminacy day by day. Woman and nature stand ever ready to reduce the male to boy and infant.
 - Feminism has become a catch-all vegetable drawer where bunches of clingy sob sisters can store their moldy neuroses.
 - Nature herself is a mass murderer, making casual, cruel experiments and condemning 10,000 to die so that one more fit will live and thrive.
 - The moral ambivalence of the great mother goddesses has been conveniently forgotten by those American feminists who have resurrected them. We cannot grasp nature’s bare blade without shedding our own blood.
 - There you have it: an expensive higher education based on sloganeering, on pat, trite phrases that substitute moral posturing for political reasoning. It’s elitism masquerading as egalitarianism.
 - For me, the Profumo affair symbolizes the evanescence of male government compared to women’s cosmic power.
 - They do not understand the fragility of civilization and the constant nearness of savage nature.
 - There is no true expertise in the humanities without knowing all of the humanities. Art is a vast, ancient interconnected web-work, a fabricated tradition. Over-concentration on any one point is a distortion.
 - Pregnancy demonstrates the deterministic character of woman’s sexuality.
 - The male orientation of classical Athens was inseparable from its genius. Athens became great not despite but because of its misogyny.
 - Lacan is a tyrant who must be driven from our shores. Narrowly trained English professors who know nothing of art history or popular culture think they can just wade in with Lacan and trash everything in sight.
 - Although I’m an atheist who believes only in great nature, I recognize the spiritual richness and grandeur of the Roman Catholicism in which I was raised.
 - Though men may be deep, mentally they are slow.
 - The true mission of feminism today is not to carp about the woes of affluent Western career women but to turn the spotlight on life-and-death issues affecting women in the Third World, particularly in rural areas where they have little protection against exploitation and injustice.
 - Not since the Black Panthers sailed into their Upper East Side tea party has there been so daffy an exercise in radical chic.
 - Capitalism has its weaknesses. But it is capitalism that ended the stranglehold of the hereditary aristocracies, raised the standard of living for most of the world and enabled the emancipation of women.
 - Jesus was a brilliant Jewish stand-up comedian, a phenomenal improviser. His parables are great one-liners.
 - If feminism has receded in visibility and prestige, it is precisely because its vision of life’s goals and rewards has become too narrow and elitist.
 - My political philosophy as a libertarian says that government has no business intervening in any consensual private behavior. My professional ethic as a thinker and writer, however, says that self-knowledge is our ultimate responsibility.
 - I am waiting impatiently for the day when beleaguered, like-minded academics can order James Wolcott’s collected essays for their classes.
 - Very gifted people may be sociopathic in varying degrees.

 - If people could see the inside of my brain, I would be in prison.
 - Running to Mommy and Daddy on the campus grievance committee is unworthy of strong women.
 - Personality maintains its discreetness by an act of will. Otherwise one person will flow helplessly into another.
 - Our major universities are now stuck with an army of pedestrian, toadying careerists, Fifties types who wave around Sixties banners to conceal their record of ruthless, beaver-like tunneling to the top.
 - I sometimes call my new system ‘Italian pagan Catholicism,’ but it could more accurately be called ‘pragmatic liberalism,’ with roots in Enlightenment political philosophy. It is a synthesis of the enduring dual elements in our culture, pagan and Judeo-Christian, Romantic and Classic.
 - It is capitalist America that produced the modern independent woman. Never in history have women had more freedom of choice in regard to dress, behavior, career, and sexual orientation.
 - Computer enhancement has spread to still photography in advertisements, fashion pictorials, and magazine covers, where the human figure and face are subtly elongated or remodeled at will. Caricature is our ruling mode.
 - Nefertiti is like Athena born from the brow of Zeus, a head-heavy armored goddess. She is beautiful but desexed.
 - The so-called miracle of birth is nature getting her own way.

 - Manhood coerced into sensitivity is no manhood at all.
 - In an era ruled by materialism and unstable geopolitics, art must be restored to the center of public education.
 - Because I’m criticizing liberalism, people automatically call me a conservative. This is madness! The idea that somehow one cannot critique liberalism from the left, from the left wing of liberalism. I mean, how can people be so stupid?
 - When in doubt, I read Oscar Wilde.
 - Sotomayor’s vainglorious lecture bromide about herself as ‘a wise Latina’ trumping white men is a vulgar embarrassment – a vestige of the bad old days of male-bashing feminism.
 - Far from poisoning the mind, pornography shows the deepest truth about sexuality, stripped of romantic veneer.
 - I’m a professor of media studies as well as humanities, and I’m an evangelist of popular culture, but when there’s only media, then there’s going to be a slow debasement of language, and that’s what I think we’re fighting.
 - There are no female geniuses because there are no female Jack-the-Rippers.

 - Except for naval and air exercises, our military should be stationed on American soil, where service men and women can lead normal lives in close proximity to family and friends.
 - As a scholar who regularly surveys archival material, I think that, a century from now, cultural historians will find David Horowitz’s spiritual and political odyssey paradigmatic for our time.
 - Feminism has exceeded its proper mission of seeking political equality for women and has ended by rejecting contingency, that is, human limitation by nature or fate.
 - The prostitute is not, as feminists claim, the victim of men, but rather their conqueror, an outlaw, who controls the sexual channels between nature and culture.
 - American universities are organized on the principle of the nuclear rather than the extended family. Graduate students are grimly trained to be technicians rather than connoisseurs. The old German style of universal scholarship has gone.
 - Society is a system of inherited forms reducing our humiliating passivity to nature. We may alter these forms, slowly or suddenly, but no change in society will change nature.
 - Poetry is the way into a spiritual vision of society and the universe.
 - Every reading is partial, but that does not absolve us from the quest for meaning, which defines us as a species.
 - Despite crime’s omnipresence, things work in society, because biology compels it. Order eventually restores itself, by psychic equilibrium.

 - Our presence in Afghanistan is not worth the price of any more American lives or treasure.
 - Male conspiracy cannot explain all female failures. I am convinced that, even without restrictions, there still would have been no female Pascal, Milton, or Kant. Genius is not checked by social obstacles: it will overcome.

 - Science cannot avert a single thunderbolt.
 - Every month, it is woman’s fate to face the abyss of time and being, the abyss which is herself.

 - I realize now how lucky I was, in the total absence of role models, to have only men to rebel against. Today’s women students are meeting their oppressors in dangerously seductive new form, as successful congenial female professors who view themselves as victims of a rigid foreign ideology.
 - Poetry is the connecting link between body and mind.
 - Effeminate men have suffered a bad press the world over.
 - The greatest honor that can be paid to the work of art, on its pedestal of ritual display, is to describe it with sensory completeness. We need a science of description. Criticism is ceremonial revivification.
 - Any woman who stays with her abuser beyond the first incident is complicitous with him.
 - We will never get great art from women if their education exposes them only to the second-rate and if the idea of greatness itself is denied. Greatness is not a white male trick. Every important world civilization has defined its artistic tradition in elitist terms of distinction and excellence.

 - Madonna’s great instinctive intelligence was evident to me from her earliest videos.
 - I certainly derived my skills as a prose writer from my scrutiny of poetry and of the individual word. But schools don’t do things like that anymore – tracking words down to their roots.

 - My generation of the Sixties, with all our great ideals, destroyed liberalism, because of our excesses.
 - My advice to the reader approaching a poem is to make the mind still and blank. Let the poem speak. This charged quiet mimics the blank space ringing the printed poem, the nothing out of which something takes shape.
 - Western man represents himself, on the political or psychological stage, in a spectacular world-theater. Our personality is innately cinematic, light-charged projections flickering on the screen of Western consciousness.
 - Mind is a captive of the body.
 - My generation of bossy, confident, baby-boom women were something brand new in history. Our energy and assertiveness weren’t created by Betty Friedan, unknown before her 1963 book, or by Gloria Steinem, whose political activism, as even the Lifetime profile admitted, did not begin until 1969.
 - As a major contemporary composer, Madonna should not let the eye dictate to the ear.
 - A serious problem in America is the gap between academe and the mass media, which is our culture. Professors of humanities, with all their leftist fantasies, have little direct knowledge of American life and no impact whatever on public policy.
 - Capitalism is an art form, an Apollonian fabrication to rival nature. It is hypocritical for feminists and intellectuals to enjoy the pleasures and conveniences of capitalism while sneering at it. Everyone born into capitalism has incurred a debt to it. Give Caesar his due.
 - This was a good example of the fascist policing of public discourse in this country by nominal liberals who have become as unthinkingly wedded to dogma as any junior member of the Spanish Inquisition.
 - Gloria Steinem’s marriage is proof positive of the emotional desperation of ageing feminists who for over 30 years worshiped the steely career woman and callously trashed stay-at-home moms.

 - The born-yesterday French-besotted faddists, addicted sniffers of wet printer’s ink, think they’re starting on the ground floor; so they’re condemned to another hundred years of trial and error. The rest of us can safely ignore them.
 - There is such a thing as seduction, and it needs encouragement rather than discouragement in our puritanical Anglo-American world.

 - A war still rages over the legacy of the 1960s.
 - Everyone of my generation who preached free love is responsible for AIDS.
