 - Do we eagerly long for the coming of Christ? Or do we want him to wait while our love affair with the world runs its course? That is the question that tests the authenticity of faith.
 - Every good thing in the Christian life grows in the soil of humility. Without humility, every virtue and every grace withers. That’s why Calvin said humility is first, second, and third in the Christian faith.
 - The key that unlocks the treasure chest of God’s peace is faith in the promises of God.
 - The evil and suffering in this world are greater than any of us can comprehend. But evil and suffering are not ultimate. God is. Satan, the great lover of evil and suffering, is not sovereign. God is.
 - The Gospel is not a picture of adoption, adoption is a picture of the Gospel.
 - Our deeds are not the basis of our salvation, they are the evidence of our salvation. They are not foundation, they are demonstration.

 - There will be no passion to draw others into our worship where there is no passion for worship.

 - Wise people know that all their money belongs to God.
 - The wisdom of God devised a way for the love of God to deliver sinners from the wrath of God while not compromising the righteousness of God.

 - Missions is the overflow of our delight in God because missions is the overflow of God’s delight in being God.

 - The highest mental health is not liking myself but being joyfully interested in everything but myself.
 - One of the most important discoveries I have ever made is this truth: God is most glorified in me when I am most satisfied in him. This is the motor that drives my ministry as a pastor. It affects everything I do.

 - The bloodline of Jesus is thicker, deeper, stronger than the bloodline of race, ethnicity and family.
 - Prayer as a relationship is probably your best indicator about the health of your love relationship with God. If your prayer life has been slack, your love relationship has grown cold.

 - Forgiveness costs us nothing. All our costly obedience is the fruit, not the root, of being forgiven. That’s why we call it grace.
 - Isn’t it ironic that today people say, ‘If you know the love of God, you don’t have to worry when you go on in sin.’ But the apostle John said, ‘If you know the love of God, you won’t be able to go on in sin.’
 - Out of the freedom from worry that God’s generosity provides comes an impulse toward simplicity rather than accumulation.
 - There is a great gulf between the Christianity that wrestles with whether to worship at the cost of imprisonment and death, and the Christianity that wrestles with whether the kids should play soccer on Sunday morning.
 - There is hope in forgiveness.
 - The assurance of the believer is not that God will save him even if he stops believing, but that God will keep him believing – God will sustain you in faith, he will make your hope firm and stable to the end. He will cause you to persevere.

 - Will I find spiritual communion with God sweet enough, and hope in his promises deep enough, not just to cope, but to flourish and rejoice in him?
 - God created us with sexual passion so that there would be language to describe what it means to cleave to him in love and what it means to turn away from him to others.

 - I measure Your love for me by the magnitude of the wrath I deserved, and the wonder of Your mercy by putting Christ in my place.
