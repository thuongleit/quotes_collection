 - Look in the perfumes of flowers and of nature for peace of mind and joy of life.
 - Walking on willow tree roads by a river dappled with peach blossoms, I look for spring light, but am everywhere lost. Birds fly up and scatter floating catkins. A ponderous wave of flowers sags the branches.
 - To be a stranger in a strange land: Whenever one feasts, one thinks of oneâ€™s brother twice as much as before, There where my brother far away is ascending, The dogwood is flowering, and a man is missed.
 - A traveler s thoughts in the night Wander in a thousand miles of dreams.
 - The autumn hill gathers the remaining light, A flying bird chases after its companion. The green color is bright And brings me into the moment, like a sunset mist that has no fixed place.
 - How could sufferings be relieved through purification? To know the Path is to get lost at the ford. Indeed, sickness comes from worldly love And poverty begins with the pursuit of greed.
 - A new home by a gap in the Meng wall; Of the old trees, a few gnarled willows are left. Those who come in the future, who will they be, Grieving in vain for what others had before?
