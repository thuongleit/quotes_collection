 - The hardest thing about the road not taken is that you never know where it might have led.
 - Your children are the greatest gift God will give to you, and their souls the heaviest responsibility He will place in your hands. Take time with them, teach them to have faith in God. Be a person in whom they can have faith. When you are old, nothing else youâ€™ve done will have mattered as much.
 - A bad past is like gristle. You can chew on it forever and starve yourself to death, or you can spit it out and see what else is on the table.
 - Sometimes we must try to view the actions of those around us with forgiveness. We must realize that they are going on the only road they can see. Sometimes we cannot raise our chins and see eye to eye, so we must bow our heads and have faith in one another.
