 - Art is long. Life is short. A picture can become for us a highway between a particular thing and a universal feeling.
 - Every work of art which really moves us is in some degree a revelation: it changes us.
 - In the inner place where true artists create there exists a pure child.
 - Visible nature is but a distorted reflection of a more perfect world and the creative individual viewing her is inspired to perceive within and behind her many garments, that which is timeless and entirely beautiful.
 - Art is not an amusement, nor a distraction, nor is it, as many men maintain, an escape from life. On the contrary, it is a high training of the soul, essential to the soul’s growth, to its unfoldment.

 - Art must take to the road and risk all for the glory of adventure.
 - New material demands new methods, and new methods fling a challenge to old convention.
 - I felt the strange brooding lonely presence of Nature fostering a new race, a new age, and as part of it, a new expression in Art. It was an unfolding of the heart itself through the effect of environment, of people, of place, and time.
