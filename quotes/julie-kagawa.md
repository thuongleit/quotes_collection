 - You made me feel alive again.
 - You will always be a monster – there is no turning back from it. But what kind of monster you become is entirely up to you.
 - If we all end up as llamas, I’m going to spend the rest of my life following you around saying ‘I told you so’ in llama-ese.
 - Whatever happens, we’re together now. Always.
 - You are my heart, my life, my entire existence.
 - Know that I’m with you always, even if you can’t see me.
 - Oh, we’re playing nice now? Shall we have tea first? Brew up a nice pot of kiss-my-ass?
 - I was allergic to myself! How pathetic was that?
 - And I swear, if there is a way for us to be together, I will find it. No matter how long it takes. If I have to chase your soul to the ends of eternity, I won’t stop until I find you, I promise.
 - I don’t care what it’s called. I just want to be with her at the end. I’m not giving up. Meghan, I’ll be with you soon. Please, wait for me.
 - You’ve gone off the deep end. Time to cut back on the anime Rob. There’s no such thing as faeries.

 - Yeah, Mom, Ethan’s turned into a monster and my best friend thinks he’s a faery. How was your day?
 - Touch her, and I’ll freeze your testicles off and put them in a jar. Understand?
 - You’re still beautiful and dangerous and incredible, and I’ll keep telling you that for as long as it takes you to believe it. But right now, all I want to do is kiss you, except I’m terrified that if I try you might throw me off this balcony.

 - Shopping is just another form of hunting. All fey are hunters, whether they admit it or not. It’s in our nature, pet, nothing unnatural about it.

 - For the rest of my existence, if I lived to see the end of this world, there would never be another Ezekiel Crosse. There would never be another soul as bright as his. And that both terrified me and made me savagely – and maybe selfishly – determined to keep him. Zeke was mine now. Forever.
