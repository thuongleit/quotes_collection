 - Lord, if your people need me, I will not refuse the work. Your will be done.
 - Hitherto I have served you as a soldier; allow me now to become a soldier to God. Let the man who is to serve you receive your donative. I am a soldier of Christ; it is not permissible for me to fight.
 - Refusing further service as a Roman soldier: I am a soldier of Christ: combat is not permitted to me.
