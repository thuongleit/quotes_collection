 - I am a Yugoslav nationalist, aiming for the unification of all Yugoslavs, and I do not care what form of state, but it must be free from Austria.
 - I am not a criminal, for I destroyed a bad man. I thought I was right.
 - I am the son of peasants and I know what is happening in the villages. That is why I wanted to take revenge, and I regret nothing.
 - I only know that I fired twice, or perhaps several times, without knowing whether I had hit or missed.
