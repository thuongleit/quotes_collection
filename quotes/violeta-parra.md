 - Don’t cry when the sun is gone, because the tears won’t let you see the stars.
 - Write as you like, use the rhythms that come out, try different instruments, sit at the piano, destroy the metric, shout instead of singing, blow your guitar and ring the horn. Hate mathematics, and love eddies. Creation is a bird without a flight plan, that will never fly in a straight line.
 - Only love with its science makes us so innocent.
