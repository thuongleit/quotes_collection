 - Marks forget that whenever something’s too good to be true, that’s because it’s a con.

 - We are, largely, who we remember ourselves to be. That’s why habits are so hard to break. If we know ourselves to be liars, we expect not to tell the truth. If we think of ourselves as honest, we try harder.

 - Some promises aren’t worth keeping.
