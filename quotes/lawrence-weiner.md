 - Art history is fine. I mean, that’s a discipline. Art history is art history, and you start from the beginning and you end up in artist in time. But art is a little bit different. Art is a conversation. And if there’s no conversation, what the hell is it about?
 - Once you know about a work of mine you own it. There’s no way I can climb inside somebody’s head and remove it.
 - Accreditation. The “doctorate of fine art.” I’ve never heard something so stupid in my entire life.
 - Art that imposes conditions – human or otherwise – on the receiver for its appreciation in my eyes constitutes aesthetic fascism.
 - Quantum physics – the idea that there is more than one reality going on at the same time in the same place. We live in a concentric society, and we’ll have to make our decisions, cake as pie, as pending resolve. It’s really and truly – I don’t know if “as” will count any longer.
 - The art schools seem to be trying to turn people out as “professional.” But I don’t know what the word “professional” means any longer. “Professional” would be somebody who was trying to push painting to a point that nobody else could do as well as he could. That would be my ideal professional.
 - What art is not processed? “Conceptual art.” Somebody making a painting has to conceive of the size. I don’t understand where these words came from. I can’t accept the fact that the concept of art as our concept of humanity is expanding.
 - There’s a radical change in the relationship with the human being and society. Art now is an open conversation with the society. Previously there was a necessity for a little bit of screaming and shouting just to get it into the conversation.
 - There are people who speculate at objects. I don’t think that makes them evil or not evil. It doesn’t matter; in order to speculate, it has to be made public. Once it’s made public, it’s functioned is art.
 - People, buying my stuff, can take it wherever they go and can rebuild it if they choose. If they keep it in their heads, that’s fine too. They don’t have to buy it to have it – they can just have it by knowing it.
 - You can’t have a $2 million painting unless it’s on the wall somewhere and somebody saw it.
 - Artists try to ask questions, and within our society, unless there are artists, those questions don’t get asked. And everybody blames the market.
 - The only art I’m interested in is the art I don’t understand right away. If you understand it right away it really has no use except as nostalgia.
 - Art’s supposed to build logic structures.
 - All art is made from anger.
 - I only work in relation to what the work is about. Yes, of course, if the world’s coming to an end I would basically try to get out of the way when the sky falls.
 - I think there should be a reworking of the value structure of art. The value is when the artist makes a first engagement with society. That work has the most value. That is the function of the artist. That result.
 - In my eyes, making art is very often about something that you don’t know.
 - Skills come with age, but wisdom, I doubt it very, very much.
 - Trying to make certain things on the Internet totally private unless you subscribe. It’s not going to work. If you can figure out how to close something down, somebody can figure out how to open it up. That’s art.
 - There is a primacy of each individual object. And we’ll see! That’s the whole point of making sculpture, to present a question in a physical form to people.
 - Now “professional” seems to be whoever you went to school with. It constitutes your nuclear world. And that’s the fault of the teachers; it’s not the fault of the young artist.
 - I think it’s a waste of time to worry about the motives of why people are supportive of things. I think we should look at the thing itself. And if they’re supportive of something that’s sexist or racist, then it’s a bad thing, but it’s not because they’re supportive of it that it’s a bad thing.
 - Like the people that in the 60s or 70s claimed the “end of painting” – all they did was open up a whole new branch for painting. Happily, it doesn’t work. It’s not a reason for art. Closing something out is not a reason for something to exist.
 - I stopped painting, not because I didn’t like painting; the sensuality of it was fun. But I wasn’t able to get to the point I wanted to.
