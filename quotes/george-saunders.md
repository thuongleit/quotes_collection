 - What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.

 - When I write I know that I’m going to have to produce 40 percent more than I need.
 - If you haven’t read you don’t have the voice. The lack of voice eliminates experience.

 - My stories, I can understand them as a little toy that you wind up and you put it on the floor and it just goes under the coach. That I get. Beyond that, I’m a little lost.

 - Err in the direction of kindness.
 - So I may not have had a gothic childhood, but childhood makes its own gothicity.
 - I tend to foster drama via bleakness. If I want the reader to feel sympathy for a character, I cleave the character in half, on his birthday. And then it starts raining. And he’s made of sugar.

 - Developing our sympathetic compassion is not only possible but the only reason for us to be here on earth.

 - The artist’s job, I think, is to be a conduit for mystery.
 - I think that’s one of the maybe under-discussed aspects of process – the difference between a good writing day and a bad one is the quality of the split-second decisions you made.

 - I’ve seen time and time again the way that the process of trying to say something dignifies and improves a person.
 - I was a big and un-ironic fan of Dear Abby when I was a kid in Chicago. I think I sort of internalized her. So I have this inner Abby: cranky, proper, folksy yet scathing, with a beehive hairdo. But that’s my issue.
 - I feel that there is nothing that can happen to a person that is banal. Everything that happens to us is interesting.
 - The word ‘funny’ is a bit like the word ‘love’ – we don’t have enough words to describe the many varieties.
