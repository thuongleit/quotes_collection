 - When we work with nature instead of trying to impose our will, the solution is often found within the problem.
 - Consciously designed landscapes which mimic the patterns and relationships found in nature, while yielding an abundance of food, fibre and energy for provision of local needs.
 - Traditional agriculture was labour intensive, industrial agriculture is energy intensive, and permaculture-designed systems are information and design intensive.
 - The Earth is a living, breathing entity. Without ongoing care and nurturing, there will be consequences too big to ignore.
 - It is not the project but the living process that will be the measure of our actions.
