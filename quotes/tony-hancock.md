 - Things just seemed to go too wrong too many times.
 - When the blind lead the blind, they all fall in the canal.
 - Nobody will ever know I existed. Nothing to leave behind me. Nothing to pass on. Nobody to mourn me. That’s the bitterest blow of all.
 - It’s both funny and sad which seem to me to be the two basic ingredients of good comedy.
 - I don’t think I gain anything by seeing myself.
