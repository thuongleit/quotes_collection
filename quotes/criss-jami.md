 - An encouraged person will eventually get his drive from encouragement; he becomes more dependent. A person that never really receives encouragement learns to move out of spite; he becomes more independent.

 - There’s nothing more contagious than the laughter of young children; it doesn’t even have to matter what they’re laughing about.
 - If ever you feel like an animal among men be a lion.
 - A solid answer to everything is not necessary. Blurry concepts influence one to focus, but postulated clarity influences arrogance.
 - I would rather a romantic relationship turn into contempt than turn into apathy. The passion in the extremities make it appear as though it once meant something. We grow from hot or cold, but lukewarm is the biggest insult.
 - You are evidence of your mother’s strength, especially if you are a rebellious knucklehead and regardless she has always maintained her sanity.
 - Every job from the heart is, ultimately, of equal value. The nurse injects the syringe; the writer slides the pen; the farmer plows the dirt; the comedian draws the laughter. Monetary income is the perfect deceiver of a man’s true worth.
 - Whenever I think of something but can’t think of what it was I was thinking of, I can’t stop thinking until I think I’m thinking of it again. I think I think too much.
 - Any fool can do something cool and look cool, but it takes skill to make something uncool cool again.

 - It has always seemed that a fear of judgment is the mark of guilt and the burden of insecurity.
 - The hard part about one being tough yet meek is the illusion of being a punching bag.

 - Armed neutrality makes it much easier to detect hypocrisy.
 - It is never just disagreement but always intellectual dishonesty that is the apologist’s worst enemy. And its apprentice is ignorance.

 - The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is the pretense of intelligent ignorance. The former is teachable; the latter is not.
 - Wise men are not pacifists; they are merely less likely to jump up and retaliate against their antagonizers. They know that needless antagonizers are virtually already insecure enough.

 - In societies where coolness and being cool is a top priority, the religious replace the word ‘religious’ with ‘spiritual’ to make their faiths seem less extreme.
 - The 2 extremes, neither one worse than the other: the result of bad religion is self-loathing and violence; the result of bad spirituality is self-worship and narcissism.
 - It’s simple, it’s not that simple; or life is simple, but the things in it are not. When a man does not understand it, he tends to inflate it. When he does, he tends to deflate it. In the end, neither images are fully accurate.
 - Society tells me to follow my own truth, but I don’t let society tell me what to do. If you need someone to tell you that, chances are you’re part of the crowd that will move on to the next fashion that comes around.

 - Most men either compromise or drop their greatest talents and start running after, what they perceive to be, a more reasonable success, and somewhere in between they end up with a discontented settlement. Safety is indeed stability, but it is not progression.

 - Cleverness isn’t always true nor is the truth always clever.
 - A lack of common sense usually ends in some heroic feat, much like the soldier who dives onto the grenade so that others may live.
 - With a hint of good judgment, to fear nothing, not failure or suffering or even death, indicates that you value life the most. You live to the extreme; you push limits; you spend your time building legacies. Those do not die.

 - Christ delves far beyond the means of superficiality, not simply because of his immaculate love, but also because he considers the distinct cases of each individual rather than withholding a broadened perception by use of stereotypes.

 - I think a lot of psychopaths are just geniuses who drove so fast that they lost control.

 - Everyone has a sense of humor. If you don’t laugh at jokes, you probably laugh at opinions.
 - I only seem negative to the fortunate. That’s because I show the less fortunate that they aren’t less fortunate after all.

 - The sea in all its vastness is its own, real world. Man is nature’s sci-fi.

 - God’s relationship with man does not work in a way in which man stumbles and then God has to drop what he is doing in order to lift him up; rather, man stumbles so that God can lift him up. Hence it is utterly impossible to truly diminish his glory.
 - There is a master way with words that cannot be learned but instead developed: a deaf man develops exceptional vision, a blind man exceptional hearing, a silent man, when given a piece of paper...
 - An artistic perspective will jab at you from a different angle; its logic comes like a pitcher with a curveball.

 - It is better to doubt that a concept is stupidly flying under your head than profoundly flying over your head.
 - Songwriting and poetry are so commonly birthed from underdogs because one can make even the ugliest situations admirable, or more beautiful than the beautiful situations – they are the most graceful media in which the lines of society are distorted.
 - Women show men beauty in things beyond their ambitions. Women tell men to stop and smell the roses.
 - If it’s true what is said, that only the wise discover the wise, then it must also be true that the lone wolf symbolizes either the biggest fool on the planet or the biggest Einstein on the planet.
 - People don’t care about being duped as long as they’re happy, which is the shortest form of happiness; hence ‘self-duprication’ becomes a habit.

 - Treat people like people. Beware of pity and patronization because in them, you can’t see when you’re unashamedly looking down on someone.
 - For the believer, humility is honesty about one’s greatest flaws to a degree in which he fearless about truly appearing less righteous than another.

 - Peace is more of an internal settlement rather than what is visible on the external.
 - It’s a good sign but rare instance when, in a relationship, you find that the more you learn about the other person, the more you continue to desire them. A sturdy bond requires a degree of youthful intrigue. Love loves its youth.

 - Music is not my life. My life is music.
 - The apologist is most entrusted with apologetics when capable of arguing his opponent’s position better than his opponent.

 - Learning isn’t acquiring knowledge so much as it is trimming information that has already been acquired.
 - Love without humility results in the inclination to act as everyone’s parent, humility without love results in the need to be everyone’s child, and love with humility results in the desire to be a friend.
 - Envy is a sign of insecurity, yes; but so is longing to be envied.
 - Whenever you feel like feeling like a devil’s advocate, Bible-thump. That, in a worldly world, is the great irony and satire of evangelism.
 - You can’t be a rebel without the scars that come with it. Truth is, some days scars are just as ugly as they are beautiful.
 - In order to share one’s true brilliance one initially has to risk looking like a fool: genius is like a wheel that spins so fast, it at first glance appears to be sitting still.
 - A god who gave us everything we wanted would be the most malevolent god of all. With an infantile curiosity, we insist on tasting the cockroach on the floor while our father is preparing a magnificent feast for us.

 - The best ideas will eat at you for days, maybe even weeks, until something, some incident, some impulse, triggers you to finally express them.
 - The only honorable, desirable kind of fear that shouldn’t be feared is the fear of harm on a loved one. It’s the kind of fear that leads to self-sacrifice and the kind of fear where you would truly jump in front of a bus to save another.
 - All individuals have moral deficiencies, and when introducing these to reality one not only strengthens himself but also the confidence of others in the human exigency for Christ due to a reflection throughout the body of Christ.
 - Great artists are a little too gifted to be bound by boxes and labels, and in saying that, the label ‘artist’ is to be used lightly.
 - The manlier you are, the harder it is to understand what a woman wants: there is not a hint of female brain in you.
 - All great leaders find a sense of balance through their levels of reception. For instance, those who support a leader may soften him, those who ignore him may challenge him, and those who oppose him may stroke his ego.
 - To swear day and night by media slander will make one a bigger victim than the slandered. It doesn’t take much to begin to fear a mere illusion of human badness.

 - The most mesmerizing of artists is always like one who was merely drawing in the sand and people came to watch.

 - When your only regret is if anyone thinks you regret anything – that is the definition of conviction.
 - To be extremely happy but extremely intelligent is a task of being optimistic without being cheesy.
 - In learning and argumentation, the quality brain is similar to a facility of maximum security. What passes the logic test, free of fallacy and pretense, then must pass the test of biblical accuracy in order to proceed as an adopted, reliable truth.
 - I would rather be an artist than a leader. Ironically, a leader has to follow the rules.
