 - A pear tree is blooming, by a collapsed house, on an old battlefield.
 - The materials for poetry are all about you in profusion.
 - Always someone resting there – a lone rock in the summer field.
 - Having examined three thousand haiku poems – two persimmons.
 - Take your materials from what is around you – if you see a dandelion, write about that; if it’s misty, write about the mist. The materials for poetry are all about you in profusion.
