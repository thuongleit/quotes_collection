 - God speaks to all individuals through what happens to them moment by moment.
 - God instructs the heart, not by ideas but by pains and contradictions.
 - There is not a moment in which God does not present Himself under the cover of some pain to be endured, of some consolation to be enjoyed, or of some duty to be performed. All that takes place within us, around us, or through us, contains and conceals His divine action.
 - If we wish to quench our thirst, we must lay aside books which explain thirst and take a drink.
 - The duties of each moment are the shadows beneath which hides the divine operation.
 - God teaches the soul by pains and obstacles, not by ideas.
 - In the shadow of death he produces life, and though the senses are terrified, faith taking all for the best, is full of courage and assurance.
 - God makes all chosen souls pass through a fearful time of poverty, misery, and nothingness. He desires to destroy in them gradually all the help and confidence they derive from themselves so that He may be their sole source of support, their confidence, their hope, their only resource.
 - The soul, light as a feather, fluid as water, innocent as a child, responds to every movement of grace like a floating balloon.
 - What God arranges for us to experience at each moment is the best and holiest thing that could happen to us.
 - We must offer ourselves to God like a clean, smooth canvas and not worry ourselves about what God may choose to paint on it, but at each moment, feel only the stroke of His brush.
 - The present moment holds infinite riches beyond your wildest dreams.
 - There is no peace more wonderful than the peace we enjoy when faith shows us God in all created things.
 - The books the Holy Spirit is writing are living, and every soul a volume in which the divine author makes a true revelation of his word, explaining it to every heart, unfolding it in every moment.
 - Souls who can recognize God in the most trivial, the most grievous and the most mortifying things that happen to them in their lives, honor everything equally with delight and rejoicing, and welcome with open arms what others dread and avoid.
 - All created things are living in the Hand of God. The senses see only the action of the creatures; but faith sees in everything the action of God.
 - To love God in great things is not so perfect an act of faith as to worship them in small ones.
