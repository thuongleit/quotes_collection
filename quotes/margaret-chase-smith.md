 - I believe that in our constant search for security we can never gain any peace of mind until we secure our own soul.
 - As an American, I want to see our nation recapture the strength and unity it once had when we fought the enemy instead of ourselves.
 - Freedom unexercised may become freedom forfeited.
 - The American people are sick and tired of being afraid to speak their minds lest they be politically smeared as ‘Communists’ or ‘Fascists’ by their opponents. Freedom of speech is not what it used to be in America. It has been so abused by some that it is not exercised by others.
 - One of the basic causes for all the trouble in the world today is that people talk too much and think too little. They act impulsively without thinking. I always try to think before I talk.
 - I always try to think before I talk.
 - Smears are not only to be expected but fought. Honor is to be earned, not bought.

 - Moral cowardice that keeps us from speaking our minds is as dangerous to this country as irresponsible talk.
 - We are Republicans. But we are Americans first. It is as Americans that we express our concern with the growing confusion that threatens the security and stability of our country.
 - We should not permit tolerance to degenerate into indifference.
 - Women administer the home. They set the rules, enforce them, mete out justice for violations. Thus, like Congress, they legislate; like the Executive, they administer; like the courts, they interpret the rules. It is an ideal experience for politics.
 - The Senate has been debased to the level of a forum of hate and character assassination sheltered by the shield of congressional immunity.

 - I don’t believe the American people will uphold any political party that puts political exploitation above national interest. Surely we Republicans aren’t that desperate for victory.
 - And this I do believe above all, especially in times of greater discouragement, that I must BELIEVE-that I must believe in my fellow people-that I must believe in myself-that I must believe in God-if life is to have any meaning.
