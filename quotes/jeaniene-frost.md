 - It was the sort of bone deep emotion that made him want to hold her tighter with one hand, and draw a sword against the world with the other.
 - No matter what happens, you will never lose me, I am forever yours, Kitten, in this life or the next.
 - You hold the ones you love close and fight the battles you can win, and that, Kitten, is how it is.
 - Just call me an equal opportunity ass-kicker.
 - The sheer splendor of the sight made my chest tighten and tears sting my eyes. All the darkness lately made it easy to forget the world contained more than people trying to hurt other people. It had beauty, too, if you knew where to look – and remembered to open your eyes.

 - Family is always irreplaceable, even when they’re also irreconcilable.
 - Wouldn’t that make a charming epitaph? Here lies Cat. Killed not by fang, but Ferragamos.

 - There’s nothing to catch up on. You came, you saw, you scored, you left. End of story.
 - I missed you every minute this week and I don’t want to spend another day without you. If my mom disowns me for being with a vampire, then that’s her decision, but I’ve made mine, and I won’t apologize of back down from it.
 - Don’t kiss me like a woman if you’re going to treat me like a child.
 - I’m sorry I can’t give you the normal life you wanted, but I promise to adore you every day for the rest of your new one.
 - People frequently bore me, sometimes amuse me, most often irritate me, but rarely intrigue me.
 - Lucifer’s hairy ball sack! You’ve become a morlock.
 - Be still my non-beating heart.
 - My body is the only thing that’s truly mine, so I don’t give it away as though it’s worthless.
 - Careful, luv. I might be angry with you, but that doesn’t mean I don’t still want you. So if you do that again, I’ll shag you right here, right now, and sod anyone who wants to watch.
 - You’re shagging a woman who can turn into a dragon? Blast you, Charles, I am sick with envy!
 - I can’t wait to find out how you taste, and you won’t want me to stop even after I’ve completely exhausted you. You’ll think you were on fire, your skin will burn. I’ll suck all of your juices out of you. And then I’ll drink your blood.
 - Charlie whistled “Amazing Grace” as he drove. It was all I could do not to whip my head around and snap, Are you kidding me? Couldn’t he pick something more appropriate, like “Shout at the Devil” or “Don’t fear the Reaper”? Some people had no sense of the proper music for a kidnapping.
 - I am offering you a real commitment – a place in my life forever. Even if our relationship ended, our tie to each other never would. Let me make you a vampire, Leila, and watch decades slide by like days while you’re by my side.
 - He leaned over and kissed me. A long, deep kiss filled with promise and passion. I loved the way he kissed me. Like he was drinking in the taste of me and still coming back thirsty.
 - Don’t care for her tongue, do you? How strange. I find it one of my favorite parts. Bones to Gregor.
 - I stared at him in silence. There were so many things I wanted to say. Like, How could you think what I feel for you is only physical? or, Don’t you know you’re my best friend? and finally, Bones, I love-.
 - My parents were dismayed by my love of horror movies as a young girl, then even more dismayed when I kept rooting for Dracula to win instead of Van Helsing.
 - Vampires, werewolves, fallen angels and fairies lurk in the shadows, their intentions far from honorable.
 - Kitten, four hours of sleep while holding you is far more beneficial to me than eight hours of endless tossing and turning because you’re not there. -Bones from This Side of the Grave.
 - If you introduce yourself to anyone as Mrs. Dracula, I’ll bite you in a manner you won’t enjoy.
 - She’s my kitten, and no one else’s.
 - Only fools pity survivors their scars and you should never kowtow to fools.
 - I have been stabbed, shot, burned, bitten, beaten unconscious too many times to count, and even staked. None of those held a candle to the pain I felt at seeing his mouth on hers.
 - Or for the gorgeously bare vampire to give her a sensual massage while feeding her peeled grapes.
 - I love you, Kitten. Don’t try to get out of this. We’ll see if you love me when I pay you back. Even then I will love you, Bones called out as I stomped away.
 - You know that old saying. Once you go dead, no one’s better in bed.
 - Maximus grunted. “Some days you remind me of Vlad.” “Meaning?” I said sharply. “Your obsession with revenge. Next you’ll want to drive a pole through that vampire once you find her.” The thought was appealing, but...
 - He was impolite while making a point? This is Vlad the Impaler. His points usually come at the end of a long pole.
 - Cat, you asked me before to find out if those dream -suppression pills had any side effects. I’ve checked with Pathology, and they said you might experience depression, mood swings, irritability, paranoia, and chronic fatigue. Have you noticed any of that?
 - Mencheres. Bones co-ruler, grandsire, Master vampire of incredible power, and the ally who unnerved me the most, had telekinetically held me down so Bones could boink me into submission enroute to the vampire holding cell? Sweet holy Jesus, let me have hallucinated hearing that!
 - You’re my Red Reaper, and I’ve missed you terribly.

 - I love you, Kitten. There’s nothing on this earth or under it that can change that.
 - Kira knew that his tounge felt like a vibrator set to the speed of Oh Hell Yeah.
 - Age had taught him patience. Youth had taught me to get frustrated at the lack of progress.

 - That one tickled. If electrocution is your way of flirting, I commend you on your originality.
 - Friends might be rare but they’re not irreplaceable.
 - Where are you, bloodsuckers? Here, fangy, fangy, fangy...
 - It hurts to much to be close to you, but continually pushed away.
 - Slumber party with Dracula, all things considerd why not?
 - I was going to die, but I didn’t have to grovel.
 - Paranormal fiction offers authors – and readers – the chance to answer the question, What if? All the different ways that question can be answered make for extremely entertaining reading.
 - I’d address his way of trying to discourage Ian later. After all, he could have come up with something other than saying I was a whiny, smelly, trumpet-snoring bad lay.
 - Usually my form of turning someone down was shoving a stake through his heart while smirking, Gotcha!
 - As if Spade’s chivalry would allow him to do anything to a woman. The harshest punishment she could imagine him dishing out to Cat would be refusing to open a door for her.
 - He’ll learn that many women can satisfy for a short period of time, but when he falls in love, only one will sustain him forever.
 - I couldn’t help shaking my head as I looked at him. Ian slept like a baby every morning – well, a baby who continually kept one hand down his pants.
 - Brave words in a room full of pulseless creatures. Spade gave Don a disgusted glance while Rodney just licked his lips. No doubt he was mentally salting and peppering Don.
 - No one believes you’re serious until bodies start to fall.
 - He picked the wrong profession. Should’ve stayed a prostitute. He’d have made millions. – Cat.
 - You can run from the grave, but you can’t hide.
 - Jesus, Mary and Joseph, I was going to squirt tears. How unprofessional.
 - Your mom can’t hate a whole country because of one person!
 - Playing with fire Kitten?
 - Beautiful and diabolical. You make me impatient indeed to claim you.
 - Don’t fret, Grannie. We’re going to a Bible retreat to scare the devil out of her.
 - All I’m saying is that sooner of later, you’ll have to come to terms with yourself. You can’t wish away the vampire in you, and you shouldn’t keep atoning for it. You should figure out who you are and what you need, and then don’t apologize for it. Not to me, to your mum, or to anyone.
 - How could I possibly keep my cool while getting sweaty with him? What if I screamed out something horrifying, like “I love you?” What if I had an epileptic attack and started drooling or spitting right in the middle of things?
 - You can hear my dreams? God, you must never get any quiet. I’d be shooting myself in the head if I were you.
 - Would you mind repeating that? I’m afraid I might have lost my wits altogether and just hallucinated what I’ve longed to hear.
 - You called her Kitten? And she let you? She put me in a coma for three days when I called her that! My balls never recovered from her smashing them into my spine!
 - I think we need to have a little talk, woman to skank.
 - Wasn’t it time she risked getting hurt again, instead of just accepting the numbness of never letting anyone in?
 - Try not to think too often, you’ll only hurt yourself.
 - All the rest of the world could only kill or devastate my mind and body. Bones alone held the power to demolish my soul.
 - Dead or not, you must be bored with women telling you how you look like the hottest, most exotic wet dream they’ve ever had. No wonder the thought of you, grapes, and some scented massage oils crossed my mind – and if you drop that towel again, I’m going to need a cold shower.
 - One corpse, extra crispy! Do I hear a thousand dollars?
 - Be good only if being bad ain’t more fun.
 - Movies. Drinks. Headless chickens. You know, girl stuff.

 - I threw my hands up. Men. They were impossible to reason with.

 - Since this was a formal undead gathering, there would be food – all kinds – drinks, dancing, and festivities, while those in power pondered whether or not to slaughter half the people around them. In other words, like a high-school prom.
 - Well, I hope your hard self enjoys flogging the bishop tonight!
 - First bubble baths. Now Disney parks. You’re shattering every creep vampire myth I’ve ever heard.
 - Am I the only one who has wood over that little vixen?
 - Maybe I was worrying for nothing. Maybe it had just been casual for him, and I wouldn’t even have to tell him it couldn’t happen again. After all, the man was a couple hundred years older than me and a former gigolo. I certainly hadn’t robbed him of his virginity.
 - There were words for what he meant to me, but if I studied every language ever spoken for the next thousand years, I still wouldn’t find enough of them to describe it.
 - You should figure out who you are and what you need, and then don’t apologize for it.
 - His embrace was my drug of choice, and as any addict knew, one sampling was way too many and a thousand never enough.
 - How about I let you floss with my jugular as well?

 - You can have all of me, I silently told him, but I’m taking all of you in return.

 - A vibrator can last all night, too, vampire! – Denise.
 - I’m the only authentic Vlad. Everyone else is merely an envious imitation.
 - I’ve watched you barely escape death several times, and each instance killed me a little inside. They may be dormant now, but we have enemies both cunning and cruel. Knowing you possess the power to defeat most of them doesn’t threaten me, luv. It relieves me to my very core.
 - Anytime you want to lay off the paybacks God, that’d be great.
 - If anyone’s under a spell, Justina, it’s me. Your daughter put one on me five years ago, and I haven’t broken free of it yet. Oh, and you’ll be delighted to know, we’ve decided to resume our relationship. Don’t bother with congratulations – trust me, your expression is congratulations enough.
 - You see, you don’t want me to love you. You want the version you’ve made up. The knight, even though I’m the dragon and I always will be.
 - People can perfect whatever facade they want, but everyone holds their sins close to their skin.
 - Good. If you checked your e-mail every five minutes, or keep texting and Tweeting in the middle of our conversation, I might snap your neck out of sheer principle.
 - I’d gone heavy on the black eye makeup until raccoons and I could pass for cousins.

 - It hasn’t escaped my notice that you only compliment me when you’re intoxicated.

 - I love you. You have no idea what you are worth to me.
 - Nice to meet you, mate, and here’s some advice: Don’t even think about it. You try anything with her and I’ll neuter you with my bare hands.
 - When I heard the ghouls coming for you, all I cared about was reaching you in time. How often must I tell you that you mean more to me than vengeance? I can live without defeating my enemies, but I cannot live without you.
 - What had started out as a game was now an open challenge, as well as a direct threat. Any further action would bear results, it was clear from the way his gaze smoldered into mine. In that way, it was like an optical erection.
 - He had black hair anybody could see was dyed, and even had one long piece wrapped around his head in that way some men did to fool no one into believing they weren’t bald. I resisted a sudden strong urge to tug away that piece and scream peekaboo! at his bare crown underneath.
 - Slash was about my height, and he used the alignment of our bodies to his greatest advantage. I let it go on for a few minutes. Right up until he unzipped his leather pants and pulled out Mr. One Eye.

 - Next to her, I felt like Carrot Top in drag. Cat re: Annette.
 - You’re meant for me, and I will have you.
