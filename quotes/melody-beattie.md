 - Gratitude turns what we have into enough.
 - Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life. It turns what we have into enough, and more. It turns denial into acceptance, chaos to order, confusion to clarity. It can turn a meal into a feast, a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.

 - Be patient. Relax and trust. Let go. Then, let go some more.

 - I used to spend so much time reacting and responding to everyone else that my life had no direction. Other people’s lives, problems, and wants set the course for my life. Once I realized it was okay for me to think about and identify what I wanted, remarkable things began to take place in my life.
 - God, help me let go of my need to be afraid. I welcome peace, trust, acceptance, and safety into my life. I will make a point of listening to my healthy, rational fears, and will relinquish all the others.
 - This moment, we are right where we need to be, right where we are meant to be.
 - Much of the time, the things we feel guilty about are not our issues. Another person behaves inappropriately or in some way violates our boundaries. We challenge the behavior, and the person gets angry and defensive. Then we feel guilty.
 - Goals give us direction. They put a powerful force into play on a universal, conscious, and subconscious level. Goals give our life direction.

 - Today, I will focus on having a good relationship with myself.

 - Today, I will let go. I will stop trying to control everything. I will stop trying to make myself be and do better, and I will let myself be.
 - Embrace and love all of yourself – past, present, and future. Forgive yourself quickly and as often as necessary. Encourage yourself. Tell yourself good things about yourself.

 - When you wonder what is coming, tell yourself the best is coming, the very best life and love have to offer, the best God and His universe have to send. Then open your hands to receive it. It’s yours.
 - The surest way to make ourselves crazy is to get involved in other people’s business, and the quickest way to become sane and happy is to tend to our own affairs.
 - Our strength will continue if we allow ourselves the courage to feel scared, weak, and vulnerable...

 - Waiting time is not wasted time. Something is being worked out – in us, in someone else, in the Universe.
 - Life is always moving, changing, shifting into its next shape. The movement is natural. It is how we evolve. Let the shifts happen. Take responsibility for yourself each step of the way. Trust the new shape and form of your world.
 - Today I will learn to reject shame. Shame is an overwhelming sense that who I am isn’t good enough. I realize that I am good enough, and that my imperfections are part of being human. I let go of shame.
 - When we’re surrounded by things that look impossible, making a simple choice to do something that’s possible is a powerful thing to do.

 - Letting go of our ideas about how life should go is a choice that sets life’s magic free.
 - Codependents are reactionaries. They overreact. They under-react. But rarely do they act. They react to the problems, pains, lives, and behaviors of others. They react to their own problems, pains, and behaviors.

 - Live your life fom your heart. Share from your heart. And your story will touch and heal people’s souls.
