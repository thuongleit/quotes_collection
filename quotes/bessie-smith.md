 - It’s a long old road, but I know I’m gonna find the end.
 - I don’t want no drummer. I set the tempo.
 - When my bed is empty, Makes me feel awful mean and blue. My springs are getting rusty, Living single like I do.
 - I ain’t good-lookin’, but I’m somebody’s angel child.
 - Listen to my story and everything will come out true.
 - The Greatest Blues Singer in the World Will Never Stop Singing.
 - I need a little sugar in my bowl and a little hot dog in my roll.
