 - Go out into the world and do good until there is too much good in the world.
 - I have a three-legged milk stool in my office perched on top of a cabinet. It is a great symbol for how to succeed in business. There are three legs: Take care of the customer, have a little fun, make a little money. If you don’t do that, it doesn’t work, but if you do, it comes together easily.
