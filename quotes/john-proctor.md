 - I have given you my soul; leave me my name!
 - I cannot speak but I am doubted, every moment judged for lies, as though I come into a court when I come into this house!
 - I do think I see some shred of goodness in John Proctor. Not enough to weave a banner with, but white enough to keep it from such dogs. Give them no tear! Tears pleasure them! Show honor now, show a stony heart and sink them with it!
 - Do that which is good, and no harm shall come to thee.
 - I should have roared you down when first you told me your suspicion. But I wilted, and like a Christian, I confessed. Confessed! Some dream I had must have mistaken you for God that day.
 - There is a promise made in any bed.
 - I am John Proctor! You will not use me! It is no part of salvation that you should use me!
 - Let you look to your own improvement before you go to judge your husband anymore.
