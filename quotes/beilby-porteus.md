 - Bad thoughts quickly ripen into bad actions.
 - One murder made a villain, Millions a hero. Princes were privileged To kill, and numbers sanctified the crime.
 - One murder makes a villian, millions a hero.
 - War its thousands slays, Peace its ten thousands.
 - But chiefly Thou, Whom soft-eyed Pity once led down from Heaven To bleed for man, to teach him how to live, And, oh! still harder lesson! how to die.
