 - My son ask for thyself another Kingdom, for that which I leave is too small for thee.
 - My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you.
 - There is no wall that is high enough to stop a horse with a cart filled with gold.
 - Perish any man who suspects that these men either did or suffered anything unseemly.
 - Oh, how small a portion of earth will hold us when we are dead, who ambitiously seek after the whole world while we are living!
