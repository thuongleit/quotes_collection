 - The betrayal of trust carries a heavy taboo.
 - I’m a traitor, but I don’t consider myself a traitor.

 - I knew quite well, when I gave the names of our agents in the Soviet Union, that I was exposing them to the full machinery of counterespionage and the law, and then prosecution and capital punishment.
 - The use of the polygraph has done little more than create confusion, ambiguity and mistakes.
 - I said in court a long time ago that I didn’t see that the Soviet Union was significantly helped by the information I gave them, nor that the United States was significantly harmed.
 - You might as well ask why a middle-aged man with no criminal record might put a paper bag over his head and rob a bank. I acted out of personal desperation.
 - I saw a limit to what I was giving as kind of a scam I was running on the KGB, by giving them people that I knew were their double agents fed to us.
 - I found that our Soviet espionage efforts had virtually never, or had very seldom, produced any worthwhile political or economic intelligence on the Soviet Union.
 - By the late ’70s I had come to question the point of a great deal of what we were doing, in terms of the CIA’s overall charter.

 - The human spy, in terms of the American espionage effort, had never been terribly pertinent.
 - No one’s interested really in knowing what policies or diplomatic initiatives or arms negotiations might have been compromised by me.
 - Foreign Ministry guys don’t become agents. Party officials, the Foreign Ministry nerds, tend not to volunteer to Western intelligence agencies.

 - An espionage organization is a collector: it collects raw information. That gets processed by a machinery that is supposed to resolve its reliability, and to present a finished product.
