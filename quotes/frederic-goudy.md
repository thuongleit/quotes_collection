 - All the old fellows stole our best ideas.
 - Of all the achievements of the human mind, the birth of the alphabet is the most momentous.
 - Someday I’ll design a typeface without a K in it, and then let’s see the bastards misspell my name.
 - When a type design is good it is not because each individual letter of the alphabet is perfect in form, but because there is a feeling of harmony and unbroken rhythm that runs through the whole design, each letter kin to every other and to all.
 - Men who would letterspace lower case would shag sheep.
