 - To the reactionary ear every whispered criticism of the elite classes has always sounded like the opening shot of an uprising.
 - To be sick and helpless is a humiliating experience. Prolonged illness also carries the hazard of narcissistic self-absorption.
 - There has always been in our national experience a type of mind which elevates hatred to a kind of creed; for this mind, group hatreds take a place in politics similar to the class struggle in some other modern societies.

 - The role of third parties is to sting like a bee, then die.
 - If there is anything more dangerous to the life of the mind than having no independent commitment to ideas, it is having an excess of commitment to some special and constricting idea.
 - The utopia of the Populists was in the past, not in the future. According to the agrarian myth, the health of the state was proportionate to the degree to which it was dominated by the agricultural class, and this assumption pointed to the superiority of an earlier age.

 - Intellect is neither practical nor impractical; it is extra-practical.
 - It is a part of the intellectual’s tragedy that the things he most values about himself and his work are quite unlike those society values in him...

 - We have learned so well how to absorb novelty that receptivity itself has turned into a kind of tradition- “the tradition of the new.” Yesterdays avant-garde experiment is today’s chic and tomorrows cliche.
 - Intellect needs to be understood not as some kind of claim against the other human excellences for which a fatally high price has to be paid, but rather as a complement to them without which they cannot be fully consummated.
