 - Anarchism is founded on the observation that since few men are wise enough to rule themselves, even fewer are wise enough to rule others.
 - Wilderness is not a luxury but a necessity of the human spirit, and as vital to our lives as water and good bread. A civilization which destroys what little remains of the wild, the spare, the original, is cutting itself off from its origins and betraying the principle of civilization itself.
 - Our modern industrial economy takes a mountain covered with trees, lakes, running streams and transforms it into a mountain of junk, garbage, slime pits, and debris.

 - There is science, logic, reason; there is thought verified by experience. And then there is California.
 - Balance, that’s the secret. Moderate extremism. The best of both worlds.

 - Simplicity is always a virtue.

 - What draws us into the desert is the search for something intimate in the remote.
 - The longest journey begins with a single step, not with a turn of the ignition key.

 - I choose to listen to the river for a while, thinking river thoughts, before joining the night and the stars.
 - Cold morning on Aztec Peak Fire Lookout. First, build fire in old stove. Second, start coffee. Then, heat up last night’s pork chops and spinach for breakfast. Why not? And why the hell not?
 - Belief? What do I believe in? I believe in sun. In rock. In the dogma of the sun and the doctrine of the rock. I believe in blood, fire, woman, rivers, eagles, storm, drums, flutes, banjos, and broom-tailed horses...
 - It is not enough to understand the natural world; the point is to defend and preserve it.

 - The great question of life is not the question of death but the question of life. Fear of death shames us all.
 - Page, Arizona, Shithead Capital of Coconino County: any town with thirteen churches and only four bars has got an incipient social problem. That town is looking for trouble.
 - Climbing K2 or floating the Grand Canyon in an inner tube; there are some things one would rather have done than do.

 - When the biggest, richest, glassiest buildings in town are the banks, you know that town’s in trouble.
 - Concrete is heavy; iron is hard – but the grass will prevail.

 - To be alive is to take risks; to be always safe and secure is death.

 - Music begins where words leave off. Music expresses the inexpressible. If there is a Kingdom of Heaven, it lies in music.
 - Simply because humankind have the power now to meddle or ‘manage’ or ‘exercise stewardship’ in every nook and cranny of the world does not mean that we have a right to do so. Even less, the obligation.
 - To be everywhere at once is to be nowhere forever, if you ask me.

 - The ideal kitchen-sink novel: Throw in everything but the kitchen sink. Then add the kitchen sink.

 - Liberty cannot be guaranteed by law. Nor by any thing else except the resolution of free citizens to defend their liberties.
 - One single act of defiance against power, against the State that seems omnipotent but is not, transforms and transfigures the human personality. At least for a time. For a while. Perhaps that is enough.

 - Fence straddlers have no balls. In compensation, however, they enjoy a comfortable seat and can retreat swiftly, when danger threatens, to either side of the fence. There is something to be said for every position.
 - One of the pleasant things about small town life is that everyone, whether rich or poor, liked or disliked, has some kind of a role and place in the community. I never felt that living in a city – as I once did for a couple of years.
 - What did Jesus say to the headwaiter at the Last Supper? ‘Separate checks, please.’

 - The best argument for Christianity is the Gregorian chant. Listening to that music, one can believe anything – while the music lasts.
 - Romanticism was more than merely an alternative to a sterile classicism; romanticism made possible, especially in art, a great expansion of the human consciousness.

 - In the modern technoindustrial culture, it is possible to proceed from infancy into senility without ever knowing manhood.

 - Salome had but seven veils; the artist has a thousand.

 - Shakespeare wrote great poetry and preposterous plays. Who really cares, for example, which petty tyrant rules Milan? Or who succeeds to the throne of Denmark? Or why the barons ganged up on Richard II?
 - In metaphysics, the notion that earth and all that’s on it is a mental construct is the product of people who spend their lives inside rooms. It is an indoor philosophy.
 - Good writing can be defined as having something to say and saying it well. When one has nothing to say, one should remain silent. Silence is always beautiful at such times.
 - What ideal, immutable Platonic cloud could equal the beauty and perfection of any ordinary everyday cloud floating over, say, Tuba City, Arizona, on a hot day in June?

 - There comes a point, in literary objectivity, when the author’s self- effacement is hard to distinguish from moral cowardice.

 - In the land of bleating sheep and braying jackasses, one brave and honest man is bound to create a scandal.
 - The sense of justice springs from self-respect; both are coeval with our birth. Children are born with an innate sense of justice; it usually takes twelve years of public schooling and four more years of college to beat it out of them.
 - If wilderness is outlawed, only outlaws can save wilderness.
 - We’re all undesirable elements from somebody’s point of view.
 - In both metaphysics and art, honesty is the best policy. Keep it clean.

 - We should restore the practice of dueling. It might improve manners around here.
 - Saving the world is only a hobby. Most of the time I do nothing.
 - We are preoccupied with time. If we could learn to love space as deeply as we are now obsessed with time, we might discover a new meaning in the phrase to live like men.
 - A city man is a home anywhere, for all big cities are much alike. But a country man has a place where he belongs, where he always returns, and where, when the time comes, he is willing to die.

 - By the age of forty, a man is responsible for his face. And his fate.
 - Motherhood is an essential, difficult, and full-time job. Women who do not wish to be mothers should not have babies.
