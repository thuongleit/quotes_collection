 - Intellectual understanding does not always bring visceral belief.
 - This is what historians usually do, quibble about cause and effect when the point is, there are times when the world is in flux and the right voice in the right place can move the world. Thomas Paine and Ben Franklin, for instance. Bismark. Lenin.
 - Isn’t it possible, he wondered, for one person to love another without trying to own each other? Or is that buried so deep in our genes that we can never get it out? Territoriality.

 - I buy way too many books.
 - Don’t win loyalty, just obedience, and only while the lash is in the room.

 - I’ve learned much, Father, and this above all: that no station in life is above any other, if it’s occupied by someone with a good heart.

 - But the truth is that no person ever understands another, from beginning to end of life, there is no truth that can be known, only the story we imagine to be true, the story they really believe to be true about themselves; and all of them lies.
 - The most important training, though, is to experience life as a writer, questioning everything, inventing multiple explanations for everything. If you do that, all the other things will come; if you don’t, there’s no hope for you.
 - Religion is tied to the deepest feelings people have. The love that arises from that stewing pot is the sweetest and strongest, but the hate is the hottest, and the anger is the most violent.

 - Please don’t disillusion me. I haven’t had breakfast yet.
 - If only we were wiser or better people, perhaps the gods would explain to us the mad, unbearable things they do.
 - Isn’t that what it means to be civilized? That you can wait to get what you want?
 - Ender understood more than she said. Manipulation of gravity was one thing; deception by the officers was another; but the most important message was this: the adults are the enemy, not the other armies. They do not tell us the truth.
