 - Remember who you are and whose you are.
 - God is present in everything. In the universe in creation, in me and all that happens to me, in my brothers and sisters, in the church – everywhere.
 - Part of my approach to my illness has been to say I want to choose life, I want to keep going, I want to live fully until I die.
 - I know that God is using me in ways beyond my comprehension.
 - I find that when I am involved in the business of life, when I’m working with people, particularly with children, I feel better. A kind of strength and energy comes with that.
 - I think the difference between me and some people is that I’m content to do my little bit. Sometimes people think they have to do big things in order to make change. But if each one would light a candle we’d have a tremendous light.
 - God has given me the grace to see some of the seeds that I have sown bear good fruit, and I am so grateful.
 - I try to make sense of life. I try to keep myself open to people and to laughter and to love and to have faith.
