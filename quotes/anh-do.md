 - There’s only two times in life, there’s now and there’s too late.
 - If the worst happens, if you lose and fail, but you still celebrate coming second because you’ve given it a red hot go. There is no need to fear failure.
 - Always question your fear, Anh. there’s almost never a good reason to be scared.
 - And don’t kid yourself; when you don’t decide, that’s a decision.
