 - I definitely believe that love conquers all, yes.

 - I can’t do modeling disconnected. And I thought, “What do I like? What do I love about modeling?” And what I love is that it’s such a creative process, with a bunch of people, and I wanted that more, which is how the acting thing came about.
 - For modeling, I was always creating characters. I dress like a tomboy. So, when I’d go into a shoot, there’d be all these dresses, and I’d say to myself, ‘Okay, this isn’t me. It’s somebody else. So, who is this person?’ Acting is the next level of that.

 - I suppose each project is a new thing, so there’s all this excitement and nerves about this new thing. Every single thing is like a new thing, so it’s never what I expect. I don’t know what to expect for the next thing. There are always different people. It’s interesting.

 - Everything about acting drives me and gives me the need to really try it. It’s an evolution – doing the same thing for 12 years is kind of a chunk. Anyone would be up for a little bit of a change. It is so rewarding to do a movie, and so enjoyable. It’s hard work, but really wonderful.
