 - The revolutionary can have no friendship or attachment, except for those who have proved by their actions that they, like him, are dedicated to revolution.
 - The revolutionary despises public opinion. He despises and hates the existing social morality in all its manifestations. For him, morality is everything which contributes to the triumph of the revolution. Immoral and criminal is everything that stands in its way.
