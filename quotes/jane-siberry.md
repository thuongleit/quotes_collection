 - Though the night seems long, you’re tears won’t fall forever.
 - If you ask someone if they like music, they look at you strangely. It seems to be a universal given. Like asking someone if they like breathing. It is like breathing. Or air, rather. Flowing without and within. A matrix within which our lives are set. The setting for the tableware of our beings.
 - It’s all about consistency, and what makes a child or a dog secure: order, clarity – all those things.
 - Hurry, conscious younger people! Get to power quickly so political decisions can be based on the greater good for all rather than the greater gain for few. Hurry, before it is too late!
 - You can’t chop down a symmetry.

 - I’d like to see the Second Coming in every one of us. That we all be Jesus. That we all embody that consciousness.
 - I tour alone. There’s no sound check, no back up. I stay with the hosts I am in a family home and it’s really nourishing. I just have to remember after the show not to run out into the living room in my pyjamas. Every day, it’s a new relationship being built. It’s odd and wonderful.
 - I’d probably be famous now if I wasn’t such a good waitress.
 - As far as I understand, the Second Coming is already here. It’s a consciousness. It is not someone who is going to arrive and land in a clearing in the forest. The Hell that they talk of is going to be people creating their own unhappiness, a Hell on Earth.
 - Ultimately you understand there is order in the universe, even if there is no order in your immediate circumstances.
 - I’m just opening the doors. And a lot of this is new to me – thinking about it, and letting go again and again and again, trusting that if I’m meant to continue working as a musician, it’ll happen. If I’m not, then pull out the life support.
 - I think judgment is from within. It’s not a God judging. Someone who is nasty – they’re the one who has to sleep at night.
 - So many of my friends are still trying to get record deals, and I’ve had one for 10 years now, where my only goal is to make the best music I can make. I’ve been very lucky. I have great faith that I’m exactly where I’m supposed to be, and whatever happens is going to be absolutely right for me.
 - Music is all about training in harmony, training to understand and use musical energy for our greater pleasure by attuning to the natural laws of the universe.
 - I was raised on pop music. Anything classical ran together in a complicated blur.
 - I see more people taking on the cloak of accountability, more people tiring of the blame game. If we are all connected and our actions in Australia affect us in Istanbul, then we are all to blame and all to be healers. We can’t blame lawyers anymore for the ‘liability’ vs. common sense imbalance.
 - Acceptable food rots while we are chased from bins behind restaurants, chased from sleeping on the street, chased from relieving ourselves unless we pay for food or gas, until finally we are so hungry, sleepless, smelly, constipated and beaten-down that we simply die of lack of will to live.

 - I try to make my music have the quiet spaces of folk, the intimacy, and the energy of rock.

 - I think, because I’m an artist, part of my job is to be a barometer, an antenna. It’s in the air and it resonates with a lot of people to lighten up.
 - I think we’re returning to more of the original vibration of music and creativity through the removal of this distortion called the music industry. That’s where we’re heading. And it’ll cut out a lot of music if people ever expected to make money.
 - I’ve always loved acoustic music because I’ve always loved to hear someone’s words or just watch them and just get into them. The distancing thing about rock is it’s so assaulting.
 - Every night is different, a ball of thread that unrolls differently.
 - Definitely I grew up listening to Joni Mitchell, and I think she is a wonderful writer, so she is probably part of me.

 - I’m not a household word. The climate for original music is always a bit difficult.
