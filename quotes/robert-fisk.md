 - The Syrian army is tired of corruption. It is tired of party nepotism. It is becoming very angry with those it blames for the war.

 - And history s fingers never relax their grip, never leave us unmolested, can touch us even when we would never imagine their presence.
 - Individuals in various countries like Egypt and Saudi Arabia listen to the tapes of bin Laden. They gather in groups of four or five. They feel they want to do something to express their support for what they’ve heard. The idea that they were taking orders is a particularly Western idea.

 - Tanks come in two forms: the dangerous, deadly kind and the “liberating” kind.
 - Bin Laden was very keen to point out to me that his forces had fought the Americans in Somalia. He also wanted to talk about how many mullahs in Pakistan were putting up posters saying, “We follow bin Laden.” He even produced a sort of Kodak set of snapshots of graffiti supporting him.

 - I wouldn’t say I was part of an anti-war campaign.

 - When I saw the pictures of New York without the World Trade Center, New York looked like a shadow of itself.
