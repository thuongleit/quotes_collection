 - Your weaknesses will never develop, while your strengths will develop infinitely.
 - What leaders have in common is that each really knows their strengths, has developed their strengths, and can call on the right strength at the right time.
 - Relationships help us to define who we are and what we can become. Most of us can trace our successes to pivotal relationships.
 - Our definition of a weakness is anything that gets in the way of excellent performance.
 - Each of these strategies-get a little better at it, design a support system, use one of your strongest themes to overwhelm your weakness, find a partner, and just stop doing it-can help you as you strive to build your life around your strengths.
 - If your senses are numbed with delusion and denial, you will stop looking for these true strengths and wind up living a second-rate version of someoneâ€™s life rather than a worldclass version of your own.
