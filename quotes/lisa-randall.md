 - The universe has its secrets. Extra dimensions of space might be one of them. If so, the universe has been hiding those dimensions, protecting them, keeping them coyly under wraps. From a casual glance, you would never suspect a thing.
 - Creativity is essential to particle physics, cosmology, and to mathematics, and to other fields of science, just as it is to its more widely acknowledged beneficiaries – the arts and humanities.

 - It’s hubris to think that the way we see things is everything there is.
 - One of the nice things about math and science is it’s obvious, you get the answer or you don’t get the answer.
 - Science is a combination of theory and experiment and the two together are how you make progress.
 - Basically, I wasn’t properly socialized, so it made sense to do physics.
 - Sometimes models are surprisingly smart.
 - Speculation and the exploration of ideas beyond what we know with certainty are what lead to progress.
 - When people try to use religion to address the natural world, science pushes back on it, and religion has to accommodate the results. Beliefs can be permanent, but beliefs can also be flexible. Personally, if I find out my belief is wrong, I change my mind. I think that’s a good way to live.
 - We certainly don’t yet know all the answers. But the universe is about to be pried open.
 - You might find it hard to imagine gravity as a weak force, but consider that a small magnet can hold up a paper clip, even though the entire earth is pulling down on it.
 - Although I was first drawn to math and science by the certainty they promised, today I find the unanswered questions and the unexpected connections at least as attractive.
 - All the normal matter in the Milky Way disc is denser than the dark matter that surrounds it...
 - When it comes to the world around us, is there any choice but to explore?

 - Travel at faster than the speed of light certainly can have dramatic implications that are difficult to understand, such as time travel.
 - Scientific research involves going beyond the well-trodden and well-tested ideas and theories that form the core of scientific knowledge. During the time scientists are working things out, some results will be right, and others will be wrong. Over time, the right results will emerge.
 - I had this illusion that if I kind of dressed badly that I wouldn’t stand out. So I actually went out of my way to not look different to the extent I could.

 - Maybe dark matter is denser than we usually assume, kind of like the Milky Way plane.
 - You can be only a modest distance away from the gravity brane, and gravity will be incredibly weak.
