 - Monopoly is the condition of every successful business.
 - Never invest in a tech CEO that wears a suit.
 - Every time we create something new we go from zero to one.
 - What valuable company is nobody building?
 - Your mind is software. Program it. Your body is a shell. Change it. Death is a disease. Cure it. Extinction is approaching. Fight it.
 - Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius.
 - Today’s ‘best practices’ lead to dead ends; the best paths are new and untried.
 - What important truth do very few people agree with you on?
 - The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.
 - Long-term planning is often undervalued by our indefinite short-term world.
 - Competition is overrated. In practice it is quite destructive and should be avoided wherever possible. Much better than fighting for scraps in existing markets is to create and own new ones.

 - We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters.
 - Moving first is a tactic, not a goal.
 - What nerds miss is that it takes hard work to make sales look easy.
 - Education needs to be rethought. Education does not just happen in college, but it also happens in developing skills which will enable people to contribute to our society as a whole.
 - If you can identify a delusional popular belief, you can find what lies hidden behind it: the contrarian truth.
 - There’s a wide range of sales ability: there are many gradations between novices, experts, and masters. There are even sales grandmasters. If you don’t know any grandmasters, it’s not because you haven’t encountered them, but rather because their art is hidden in plain sight.
 - Recruiting is a core competency for any company. It should never be outsourced.
 - The developing world can just do things that are extensive or horizontal, that basically copy. The developed world needs to do things that are intensive or vertical, where we take our civilization to the next level.
 - Secrets are hard but solvable problems and we should talk about them. It’s hard to work toward a radically better future if you don’t believe in secrets.
 - We cannot take for granted that the future will be better, and that means we need to work to create it today.
 - All failed companies are the same: they failed to escape competition.

 - Higher education holds itself out as a kind of universal church, outside of which there is no salvation.
 - A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
 - Under perfect competition, in the long run no company makes an economic profit.
 - EVERY MOMENT IN business happens only once. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won’t make a search engine. And the next Mark Zuckerberg won’t create a social network. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them.
 - No company has a culture, every company is a culture.
 - Whatever the career, sales ability distinguishes superstars from also-rans.

 - The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund combined.

 - The road doesn’t have to be infinite after all. Take the hidden paths.
 - Great tech opportunities happen only once.
 - Every tech story is different. Every moment in history happens only once. All successful companies are successful in their own unique way. It’s your task to figure out what that future history will be.
 - My own answer to the contrarian question is that most people think the future of the world will be defined by globalization, but the truth is that technology matters more.
 - There are still many large white spaces on the map of human knowledge. You can go discover them. So do it. Get out there and fill in the blank spaces. Every single moment is a possibility to go to these new places and explore them.
 - The business model piece is we’re always talking about competing more effectively. If you’re starting a company or career you don’t want to compete. You want to create a monopoly. We want to invest in a company that has a good plan to create a monopoly.
 - I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.

 - The most successful businesses have an idea for the future that’s very different from the present.

 - Probably the most extreme form of inequality is between people who are alive and people who are dead.
 - For Hamlet, greatness means willingness to fight for reasons as thin as an eggshell: anyone would fight for things that matter; true heroes take their personal honor so seriously they will fight for things that don’t matter.
 - As an investor-entrepreneur, I’ve always tried to be contrarian, to go against the crowd, to identify opportunities in places where people are not looking.
 - There are quite a lot of people who think my aspirations are not possible. That’s a good thing. We don’t need to really worry about these people very much, because since they don’t think it’s possible they won’t take us very seriously- and they will not actually try to stop us until it’s too late.
 - If they don’t go to law school, bright college graduates head to Wall Street precisely because they have no real plan for their careers.
 - The most fundamental reason that even businesspeople underestimate the importance of sales is the systematic effort to hide it at every level of every field in a world secretly driven by it.
 - Anti-aging is an extremely under-explored field.
 - I think in my twenties I tended to think of all people as sort of more or less alike. In now think that people are really different in all these subtle ways that are very important.
 - American government is not dominated by engineers, it is dominated by lawyers. Engineers are interested in substance and building things; lawyers are interested in process and rights and getting the ideology correctly blended. And so there is sort of no really concrete plan for the future.
 - A true bubble is when something is overvalued and intensely believed. Education may be the only thing people still believe in in the United States. To question education is really dangerous. It is the absolute taboo. It’s like telling the world there’s no Santa Claus.
 - Darwinism may be a fine theory in other contexts, but in startups, intelligent design works best.
 - The value of failure is greatly over-rated. It’s a preposterous myth.
 - All Rhodes Scholars had a great future in their past.

 - Forget startup companies. The next frontier is startup countries.
 - Everybody has a product to sell – no matter whether you’re an employee, a founder, or an investor. It’s true even if your company consists of just you and your computer. Look around. If you don’t see any salespeople, you’re the salesperson.
 - Technology and capitalism are very much linked. I think that capitalism probably works best in a technologically progressing society.
 - It is sort of a bit of a caricature of capitalism, that it’s always this zero-sum game where you have winners and losers. Silicon Valley, the technology industry at its best, creates a situation where everybody can be a winner.

 - A true bubble is when something is overvalued and intensely believed.
 - We need more pessimism that the future might be a lot worse, and we need more optimism that the future might be better.
 - In the ’30s, the Keynesian stuff worked at least in the sense that you could print money without inflation because there was all this productivity growth happening. That’s not going to work today.

 - Technology is probably the single biggest driver of productivity gains for the developed countries. For example, I think it’s much more important than free trade.
 - I think that markets classically fail in cases where there are public goods that provide benefits that people cannot capture. The big debate is how big these public goods are, where they exist, things of that sort.
 - I’m in favor of free trade, but I think if you had to make a choice between having technological progress versus free trade, you had one or the other, you should always pick technological progress. I think it’s an incredibly important variable for creating more prosperity.
