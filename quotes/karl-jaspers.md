 - Philosophic meditation is an accomplishment by which I attain Being and my own self, not impartial thinking which studies a subject with indifference.
 - Only as an individual can man become a philosopher.
 - A scientific approach means knowing what one knows and what one doesn’t. Absolute or complete knowledge is unscientific.
 - My own being can be judged by the depths I reach in making these historical origins my own.
 - On the question of the world as a whole, science founders. For scientific knowledge the world lies in fragments, the more so the more precise our scientific knowledge becomes.
 - Only a development of thought achieved through the self-education of the whole man can prevent any body of thought whatsoever from becoming a poison; can prevent enlightenment from becoming an agent of death.

 - All democracies demand common public education because nothing makes people so much alike as the same education.
 - Everything depends therefore on encountering thought at its source. Such thought is the reality of man’s being, which achieved consciousness and understanding of itself through it.
 - The Socratic teacher turns his students away from himself and back onto themselves; he hides in paradoxes, makes himself inaccessible. The intimate relationship between student and teacher here is not one of submission, but of a contest for truth.

 - Only then, approaching my fortieth birthday, I made philosophy my life’s work.
 - The history of philosophy is not, like the history of the sciences, to be studied with the intellect alone. That which is receptive in us and that which impinges upon us from history is the reality of man’s being, unfolding itself in thought.
