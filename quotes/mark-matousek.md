 - Whatever it takes to break your heart and wake you up is grace.
 - The more we remember that life is a gift-that everything changes, we’re not in control-the stronger our sense of well-being becomes.
 - When we set our hearts on knowing the truth, we assist one another in the long tender work of awakening. When the story is right, and the people we love are waiting to listen, we tell each other how to live.
 - There’s a myth among amateurs, optimists and fools that beyond a certain level of achievement, famous artists retire to some kind of Elysium where criticism no longer wounds and work materializes without their effort.
