 - Silicon Valley is the best place to start a tech company in so many ways.
 - You shouldn’t be afraid of failure – when something fails, you think, ‘What did I learn from that experience? I can do better next time.’ Then kill that project and move on to the next. Don’t get disappointed.
 - If you want to be an entrepreneur, it’s not a job, it’s a lifestyle.
 - Surround yourself with smart, dedicated people – to build something isn’t a one-man show. It’s more important to have smart people who really believe in what you’re doing than really experienced people who may not share your dream.
 - The next Google or Facebook will come from somewhere other than Silicon Valley.
 - As an entrepreneur, if you’re the originator, you need to be faster than ever.
 - Angry Birds is one of the fastest-growing online products I’ve seen, growing even faster than Skype, and the company has done a brilliant job of extending it across different platforms and merchandise.
 - It is very similar to companies like Google and other internet companies. When you go and search on Google you don’t pay for that. But sometimes you click on an advert and Google makes money on that.
 - People need to access Skype wirelessly, no matter where they are, and what happens is that we’ll be taking advantage of the rollout of Internet everywhere – WiFi and WiMax in particular.
 - Today as an entrepreneur you have more options.
 - Skype is easy enough to use so that people don’t need to be tech savvy – a lot of users just want to communicate with their friends and family, and they find this is the easiest, cheapest way.
 - With our work at Kazaa, we began seeing growing broadband connections and more powerful computers and more streaming multimedia, and we saw that the traditional way of communicating by phone no longer made a lot of sense.
 - The telephone is a 100-year-old technology. It’s time for a change. Charging for phone calls is something you did last century.
 - We have just started, and if you compare the number of people using Skype to the number using a telephone network around the world, we’re still just starting.
 - The thing about the Internet is the openness. People can link to each other themselves.
 - It’s extremely hard to build a company with a product that everyone loves, is free and has no business model, and then to innovate a business model. I did that with Kazaa, had half a billion downloads but that wasn’t a sustainable business.
 - Another differentiator is that Skype is free and simple to set up, and it costs us virtually nothing for a new user to join the Skype network, which is why we can offer the service for free.
 - When radio stations started playing music the record companies started suing radio stations. They thought now that people could listen to music for free, who would want to buy a record in a record shop? But I think we all agree that radio stations are good stuff.
 - The Chinese market is very, very unique.
 - You have 1 billion people using the Internet with 200 million of those now using broadband internet connections, so the Internet has become a powerful network. It can carry calls.
 - Look for when the environment is changing – the big shift now is mobile Internet. It’s really happening big-time. The way you interact with services on a smart phone compared to the Web is quite different, so there’s a huge opportunity.
 - And the VCR did the same thing: the movie industry thought nobody would ever watch movies any more.
 - Today, over one million people now make their living on eBay, which is astounding.
 - Video is moving online in a big way. It’s proven to be a challenging market for some companies that start out as a pure Internet company such as Joost.
 - If you can use a Web browser, you can use Skype.
 - We also have a conference call feature where up to five people can talk on one Skype call.
 - When a business becomes successful seemingly overnight, no one knows about all the months and years you’ve invested, all the projects you’ve tried before that didn’t work.
 - Then people started using it more and more and it became the most downloaded software on the internet.
 - When we look at investing, we always think about ‘how defensible is this, how likely is it that somebody is going to copy this.’ E-commerce tends to be something easy to copy because it’s execution.
 - I hope that my investment into Atomico will become my best financial investment to date.
 - They also can combine voice with instant messaging and online file sharing.
 - Some Internet operators are concerned that video services such as Netflix and YouTube consume lots of the bandwidth on the network. While there is some truth to this, my guess is that the operators wished they could provide the same kind of services with the same success as Netflix and YouTube.
 - When we started Skype, if you look at analyst reports, no one forecasted it as a big business. Also when Google started, it was not fashionable to be in search. It’s not trying to do the obvious – that’s the hard part.
 - Skype is for any individual who has a broadband Internet connection.
 - As an investor, what we’re not looking for is ‘oh this is a cool app,’ it’s ‘is this something that can become a big business?’ You need to find those that can become real businesses.
