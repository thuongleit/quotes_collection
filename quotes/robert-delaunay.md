 - Vision is the true creative rhythm.
 - Light in Nature creates the movement of colors.
 - Impressionism; it is the birth of Light in painting.
 - Our understanding is correlative to our perception.
 - Simultaneity in light is harmony, the rhythm of colors which creates the Vision of Man.

 - Light comes to us by the sensibility. Without visual sensibility there is no light, no movement.
 - I am very much afraid of definitions, and yet one is almost forced to make them. One must take care, too, not to be inhibited by them.
 - I say it is indispensable to look ahead of and behind oneself in the present. If there is such a thing as tradition, and I believe there is, it can only exist in the sense of the most profound movements of culture.
