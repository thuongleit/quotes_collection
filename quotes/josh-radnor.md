 - Time off from the news is always something I welcome.
 - And so, however many people watch this thing, that’s how many different opinions there will be about it. But I don’t feel like it has an agenda in terms of its ideology. It just presents a story like a mirror. It’s a mirror more than it is than a distorted mirror.
