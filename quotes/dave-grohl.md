 - I always loved writing songs – writing for myself and demo-ing songs, really with no intention of ever letting anyone else hear them.

 - What I really miss these days in music – is the music. I prefer to listen to melodies and songs, not just sounds.
 - Whenever I say I made a record in the garage, people just assume that I have, like, a Lear jet parked in there or something. But really there’s old luggage, a couple of bikes. It’s big enough to put one minivan in. That’s it. No dartboard. I’m so not macho.
 - I love everything about my job, except being away from the kids.
 - If there’s one thing I’m good at, it’s gathering people together to do something fun.

 - I have crazy claustrophobic dreams, weird elevator dreams where the elevator closes in and all of a sudden I am lying down – oh my God, it’s a casket. Just freaky stuff like that.

 - I’m told that my blood sugar level was twelve times the legal limit – I was sweating honey.

 - We only do what feels right. If something feels forced or contrived, then we pull back. We remain the Foo Fighters.

 - Dude, maybe not everyone loves ‘Glee.’ Me included. I watched 10 minutes and it wasn’t my thing.
