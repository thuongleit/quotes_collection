 - The world is a country which nobody ever yet knew by description; one must travel through it one’s self to be acquainted with it.
 - The difference between a man of sense and a fop is that the fop values himself upon his dress; and the man of sense laughs at it, at the same time he knows he must not neglect it.

 - Silence and reserve suggest latent power. What some men think has more effect than what others say.

 - Sincerity is the most compendious wisdom.
 - I recommend to you to take care of the minutes; for hours will take care of themselves. I am very sure, that many people lose two or three hours every day, by not taking care of the minutes.

 - History is but a confused heap of facts.
 - Persist and persevere, and you will find most things that are attainable, possible.
 - True politeness is perfect ease and freedom. It simply consists in treating others just as you love to be treated yourself.
 - In the course of the world, a man must very often put on an easy, frank countenance, upon very disagreeable occasions; he must seem pleased, when he is very much otherwise; he must be able to accost and receive with smiles, those whom he would much rather meet with swords.
 - To know a little of anything gives neither satisfaction nor credit, but often brings disgrace or ridicule.
 - In business be as able as you can, but do not be cunning; cunning is the dark sanctuary of incapacity.
 - Style is the dress of thoughts; and let them be ever so just, if your style is homely, coarse, and vulgar, they will appear to as much disadvantage, and be as ill received, as your person, though ever so well-proportioned, would if dressed in rags, dirt, and tatters.

 - Inferiority is what you enjoy in your best friends.
 - Firmness of purpose is one of the best instruments of success.
 - Real friendship is a slow grower.
 - Vulgarism in language is the distinguishing characteristic of bad company, and a bad education. A man of fashion avoids nothing with more care than that. Proverbial expressions, and trite sayings, are the flowers of the rhetoric of vulgar man.
 - Elegance of manner is the outgrowth of refined and exalted sense.
 - You must be respectable, if you will be respected.
 - The insolent civility of a proud man is, if possible, more shocking than his rudeness could be; because he shows you, by his manner, that he thinks it mere condescension in him; and that his goodness alone bestows upon you what you have no pretense to claim.

 - Women who are either indisputably beautiful, or indisputably ugly, are best flattered upon the score of their understandings.

 - Women especially as to be talked to as below men, and above children.
 - For my own part, I would rather be in company with a dead man than with an absent one; for if the dead man gives me no pleasure, at least he shows me no contempt; whereas the absent one, silently indeed, but very plainly, tells me that he does not think me worth his attention.

 - The scholar without good breeding is a pedant; the philosopher, a cynic.

 - Dispatch is the soul of business, and nothing contributes more to dispatch than method.
 - Women have, in general, but ne object, which is their beauty; upon which, scarce any flattery is too gross for them to swallow.
 - Religion is by no means a proper subject of conversation in mixed company; it should only be treated among a very few people of learning, for mutual instruction. It is too awful and respectable a subject to become a familiar one.

 - Swift speedy time, feathered with flying hours, Dissolves the beauty of the fairest brow.
 - Good manners, to those one does not love, are no more a breach of truth, than “your humble servant,” at the bottom of a challengeis; they are universally agreed upon, and understand to be things of course. They are necessary guards of the decency and peace of society.
 - If you wish particularly to gain the good graces and affection of certain people, men or women, try to discover their most striking merit, if they have one, and their dominant weakness, for every one has his own, then do justice to the one, and a little more than justice to the other.

 - A man of sense may be in haste, but can never be in a hurry.
 - People hate who makes you feel one’s inferiority.

 - A man who cannot command his temper should not think of being a man in business.
 - If originally it was not good for a man to be alone, it is much worse for a sick man to be so; he thinks too much of his distemper, and magnifies it.

 - Women’s beauty, like men’s wit, is generally fatal to the owners.
 - The only solid and lasting peace between a man and his wife is, doubtless, a separation.
 - I really know nothing more criminal, more mean, and more ridiculous than lying. It is the production either of malice, cowardice, or vanity; and generally misses of its aim in every one of these views; for lies are always detected, sooner or later.
 - Indifference is commonly the mother of discretion.
 - Remember that the wit, humour, and jokes of most mixed companies are local. They thrive in that particular soil, but will not often bear transplanting.

 - A joker is near akin to a buffoon; and neither of them is the least related to wit.
 - Prepare yourself for the world, as athletes used to do for their exercises; oil your mind and your manners, to give them the necessary suppleness and flexibility; strength alone will not do.
 - A seeming ignorance is very often a most necessary part of worldly knowledge. It is, for instance, commonly advisable to seem ignorant of what people offer to tell you; and, when they say, Have you not heard of such a thing? to answer, No, and to let them go on, though you know it already.
 - When you have found out the prevailing passion of any man, remember never to trust him where that passion is concerned.
 - May you live as long as you are fit to live, but no longer, or, may you rather die before you cease to be fit to live than after!
 - Deafness produces bizarre effects, reversing the natural order of things; the interchange of letters is the conversation of the deaf, and the only link with society. I would be in despair, for instance, over seeing you speak, but, instead, I am only too happy to hear you write.
 - Artichoke: That vegetable of which one has more at the finish than at the start of dinner.
 - Men are much more unrolling to have their weaknesses and their imperfections known than their crimes; and if you hint to a man that you think him silly, ignorant, or even ill-bred or awkward, he will hate you more and longer than if you tell him plainly that you think him a rogue.
 - In the ordinary course of things, how many succeed in society merely by virtue of their manners, while others, however meritorious, fail through lack of them? After all, it’s only barbarians who wear uncut precious stones.

 - It is reported here that the King of Prussia has gone mad and has been locked up. There would be nothing bad about that: at leastthat might of his would no longer be a menace, and you could breathe freely for a while. I much prefer madmen who are locked up to those who are not.
 - Young men are apt to think themselves wise enough, as drunken men are apt to think themselves sober enough.

 - Ugliness is a letter of credit for some special purposes.
 - Truth, but not the whole truth, must be the invariable principle of every man who hath either religion, honour, or prudence. Thosewho violate it, may be cunning, but they are not able. Lies and perfidy are the refuge of fools and cowards.
 - There is not a more prudent maxim, than to live with one’s enemies as if they may one day become one’s friends; as it commonly happens, sooner or later, in the vicissitudes of political affairs.
 - The possibility of remedying imprudent actions is commonly an inducement to commit them.
 - Buy good books, and read them; the best books are the commonest, and the last editions are always the best, if the editors are not blockheads.
 - If ever a man and his wife, or a man and his mistress, who pass nights as well as days together, absolutely lay aside all good breeding, their intimacy will soon degenerate into a coarse familiarity, infallibly productive of contempt or disgust.

 - Either a good or a bad reputation outruns and gets before people wherever they go.

 - Whenever a man seeks your advice he generally seeks your praise.
 - Manners must adorn knowledge and smooth its way in the world, without them it is like a great rough diamond, very well in a closet by way of curiosity, and also for its intrinsic value; but most prized when polished.
 - In the case of scandal, as in that of robbery, the receiver is always thought as bad as the thief.
 - Horse-play, romping, frequent and loud fits of laughter, jokes, and indiscriminate familiarity, will sink both merit and knowledge into a degree of contempt. They compose at most a merry fellow; and a merry fellow was never yet a respectable man.
 - Frequent and loud laughter is the characteristic of folly and ill manners.

 - I am very sure that any man of common understanding may, by culture, care, attention, and labor, make himself what- ever he pleases, except a great poet.

 - To please people is a great step towards persuading them.
 - There are people who indulge themselves in a sort of lying, which they reckon innocent, and which in one sense is so; for it hurtsnobody but themselves. This sort of lying is the spurious offspring of vanity, begotten upon folly.
 - In matters of religion and matrimony I never give any advice; because I will not have anybody’s torments in this world or the next laid to my charge.
 - Pray be always in motion. Early in the morning go and see things; and the rest of the day go and see people. If you stay but a week at a place, and that an insignificant one, see, however, all that is to be seen there; know as many people, and get into as many houses as ever you can.

 - Whenever I go to an opera, I leave my sense and reason at the door with my half-guinea, and deliver myself up to my eyes and my ears.

 - Our conjectures pass upon us for truths; we will know what we do not know, and often, what we cannot know: so mortifying to our pride is the base suspicion of ignorance.
 - There is nothing that people bear more impatiently, or forgive less, than contempt: and an injury is much sooner forgotten than an insult.
 - Merit and knowledge will not gain hearts, though they will secure them when gained.
 - Violent measures are always dangerous, but, when necessary, may then be looked on as wise. They have, however, the advantage of never being matter of indifference; and, when well concerted, must be decisive.

 - An ignorant man is insignificant and contemptible; nobody cares for his company, and he can just be said to live, and that is all.
 - If a man, notoriously and designedly, insults and affronts you, knock him down; but if he only injures you, your best revenge is to be extremely civil to him in your outward behaviour, though at the same time you counterwork him, and return him the compliment, perhaps with interest.

 - Pleasure is the rock which most young people split upon; they launch out with crowded sails in quest of it, but without a compassto direct their course, or reason sufficient to steer the vessel; for want of which, pain and shame, instead of pleasure, are the returns of their voyage.
 - Smooth your way to the head, through the heart. The way of reason is a good one; but it is commonly something longer, and perhapsnot so sure.

 - Speak the language of the company you are in; speak it purely, and unlarded with any other.

 - Speak of the moderns without contempt and of the ancients without idolatry; judge them all by their merits, but not by their age.
 - Sincerity w the most compendious wisdom, an excellent instrument for the speedy despatch of business. It creates confidence in those we have to deal with, saves the labor of many inquiries, and brings things to an issue in few words.
 - The herd of mankind can hardly be said to think; their notions are almost all adoptive; and, in general, I believe it is better that it should be so; as such common prejudices contribute more to order and quiet, than their own separate reasonings would do, uncultivated and unimproved as they are.
 - Gold and silver are but merchandise, as well as cloth or linen; and that nation that buys the least, and sells the most, must always have the most money.

 - Remember that whatever knowledge you do not solidly lay the foundation of before you are eighteen, you will never be master of while you breathe.
 - Many new years you may see, but happy ones you cannot see without deserving them. These virtue, honor, and knowledge alone can merit, alone can produce.
 - A certain degree of ceremony is a necessary outwork of manners, as well as of religion; it keeps the forward and petulant at a proper distance, and is a very small restraint to the sensible and to the well-bred part of the world.
 - Nothing convinces persons of a weak understanding so effectually, as what they do not comprehend.
 - In my mind, there is nothing so illiberal, and so ill-bred, as audible laughter.
 - Women who are either indisputably beautiful, or indisputably ugly, are best flattered upon the score of their understandings; but those who are in a state of mediocrity are best flattered upon their beauty, or at least their graces; for every woman who is not absolutely ugly thinks herself handsome.

 - Fear invites danger; concealed cowards insult known ones.
 - Nothing sharpens the arrow of sarcasm so keenly as the courtesy that polishes it; no reproach is like that we clothe with a smile and present with a bow.

 - It seems to me that physical sickness softens, just as moral sickness hardens, the heart.
 - In your friendships and in your enmities let your confidence and your hostilities have certain bounds; make not the former dangerous, nor the latter irreconcilable. There are strange vicissitudes in business.
