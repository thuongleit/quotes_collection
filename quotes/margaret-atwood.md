 - I’m not sure which is worse: intense feeling, or the absence of it.
 - So much for endings. Beginnings are always more fun. True connoisseurs, however, are known to favor the stretch in between, since it’s the hardest to do anything with. That’s about all that can be said for plots, which anyway are just one thing after another, a what and a what and a what.

 - I’m a strict, strict agnostic. It’s very different from a casual, ‘I don’t know.’ It’s that you cannot present as knowledge something that is not knowledge. You can present it as faith, you can present it as belief, but you can’t present it as fact.
 - Never pray for justice, because you might get some.
 - Maybe sadness was a kind of hunger, she thought. Maybe the two went together.

 - I don’t think of poetry as a ‘rational’ activity but as an aural one. My poems usually begin with words or phrases which appeal more because of their sound than their meaning, and the movement and phrasing of a poem are very important to me.
 - The animals have no need for speech, why talk when you are a word.
 - Anaesthesia, that’s one technique: if it hurts, invent a different pain.
 - Good writing takes place at intersections, at what you might call knots, at places where the society is snarled or knotted up.

 - Axiom: you are a sea. Your eye- lids curve over chaos My hands where they touch you, create small inhabited islands soon you will be all earth: a known land, a country.
 - There’s a difference between describing and evoking something. You can describe something and be quite clinical about it. To evoke it, you call it up in the reader. That’s what writers do when they’re good.
 - Speculative fiction encompasses that which we could actually do. Sci-fi is that which we’re probably not going to see.
 - It is my contention that the process of reading is part of the process of writing, the necessary completion without which writing can hardly be said to exist.
 - You will always have partial points of view, and you’ll always have the story behind the story that hasn’t come out yet. And any form of journalism you’re involved with is going to be up against a biased viewpoint and partial knowledge.
 - Choice of evils debates always produce extremism – people choose what they hope is the lesser evil, then call it good and demonize the other choice. It will be a challenge for your generation to synthesize – to move beyond Us versus Them, to We.
 - I’m not sure I really am a Humanist. I describe myself as a rigorous agnostic, which means that you cannot declare as a matter of material truth something that is in fact a matter of spiritual belief.

 - Show me a character totally without anxieties and I will show you a boring book.
 - No one knows what cuases an outer landscape to become an inner one.

 - He was deciding whether to cut her throat or love her forever.
 - Knowledge is power only as long as you keep your mouth shut.
 - What fabrications they are, mothers. Scarecrows, wax dolls for us to stick pins into, crude diagrams. We deny them an existence of their own, we make them up to suit ourselves – our own hungers, our own wishes, our own deficiencies.
 - A movie about the past is not the same as the past.
 - A Paradox, the doughnut hole. Empty space, once, but now they’ve learned to market even that. A minus quantity; nothing, rendered edible. I wondered if they might be used-metaphorically, of course-to demonstrate the existence of God. Does naming a sphere of nothingness transmute it into being?
 - Writing poetry is a state of free float.
 - When women let their hair down, it means either sexiness or craziness or death, the three by Victorian times having become virtually synonymous.

 - Here and there are worms, evidence of the fertility of the soil, caught by the sun, half dead; flexible and pink, like lips.

 - He stops, looks up at this window, and I can see the white oblong of his face. We look at each other. I have no rose to toss, he has no lute. But it’s the same kind of hunger.
 - These things sneak up on him for no reason, these flashes of irrational happiness. It’s probably a vitamin deficiency.
 - Writing of the narrative kind, and perhaps all writing, is motivated deep down, by a fear or and fascination with mortality – by a desire to make the risky trip to the underworld and to bring something or someone back from the dead.
 - We are silent, considering shortfalls. There’s not much time left, for us to become what we once intended. Jon had potential, but it’s not a word that can be used comfortably any more. Potential has a shelf-life.
 - A reader can never tell if it’s a real thimble or an imaginary thimble, because by the time you’re reading it, they’re the same. It’s a thimble. It’s in the book.
 - I felt white, drained of blood, cared for, purified. Peaceful.
 - Things might have been different if she hadn’t been able to drift; if she’d had to concentrate on her next meal, instead of dwelling on all the injuries she felt we’d done her. An unearned income encourages self-pity in those already prone to it.

 - Blondes are like white mice, you only find them in cages. They wouldn’t last long in nature. They’re too conspicuous.
 - Gardening is not a rational act. What matters is the immersion of the hands in the earth, that ancient ceremony of which the Pope kissingthe tarmac is merely a pallid vestigial remnant.
 - Walter turned on the radio: electric violins wailing, twisted romance, the four-square beat of heartbreak. Trite suffering, but suffering nonetheless. The entertainment business. What voyeurs we have all become.
 - For the children with their greedy little mouths represent the future, which like time itself will devour all now alive.

 - I was warped early by Ray Bradbury and Edgar Allan Poe. I was very fond of Franz Kafka.
 - Fiction is not necessarily about what you know, it’s about how you feel. That is the truth about fiction, and the other truth is that all science is a tool, and we use our tools not to actualise what we know, but to implement how we feel.
 - I’ve never understood why people consider youth a time of freedom and joy. It’s probably because they have forgotten their own.

 - Popular art is the dream of society; it does not examine itself.
 - But in the end, back she comes. There’s no use resisting. She goes to him for amnesia, for oblivion. She renders herself up, is blotted out; enters the darkness of her own body, forgets her name. Immolation is what she wants, however briefly. To exist without boundaries.
