 - Let everything happen to you Beauty and terror Just keep going No feeling is final.
 - Believe in a love that is being stored up for you like an inheritance, and have faith that in this love there is a strength and a blessing so large that you can travel as far as you wish without having to step outside it.
 - And now we welcome the new year, full of things that have never been.
 - Just keep going – no feeling is final.
 - The only journey is the one within.
 - I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language.
 - Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love.
 - The purpose of life is to be defeated by greater and greater things.
 - Live your questions now, and perhaps even without knowing it, you will live along some distant day into your answers.
 - Openness, patience, receptivity, solitude is everything.
 - I want to unfold. Let no place in me hold itself closed, for where I am closed, I am false...
 - If you are patient in one moment of anger, you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.
 - Do not assume that he who seeks to comfort you now, lives untroubled among the simple and quiet words that sometimes do you good. His life may also have much sadness and difficulty, that remains far beyond yours. Were it otherwise, he would never have been able to find these words.
 - Our deepest fears are like dragons, guarding our deepest treasure.
 - Be patient with all that is unsolved in your life. Learn to love the questions themselves, until some distant day, without your knowing, you will have lived into the answers.
 - Truly it is glorious, our being here.
 - Have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Do not despair if the answers don’t come immediately. Some answers are only revealed with the passage of time.
 - For one human being to love another; that is perhaps the most difficult of all our tasks, the ultimate, the last test and proof, the work for which all other work is but preparation.
 - When anxious, uneasy and bad thoughts come, I go to the sea, and the sea drowns them out with its great wide sounds, cleanses me with its noise, and imposes a rhythm upon everthing in me that is bewildered and confused.
 - Love and death are the great gifts that are given to us; mostly they are passed on unopened.
 - I am so glad you are here. It helps me realize how beautiful my world is.
 - The highest form of love is to be the protector of another person’s solitude.
 - I want to unfold. I don’t want to stay folded anywhere, because where I am folded, there I am a lie.
 - There is only one journey. Going inside yourself.
 - I am circling around God, around the ancient tower, and I have been circling for a thousand years, and I still don’t know if I am a falcon, or a storm, or a great song.
 - I live my life in widening circles that reach out across the world.
 - Live the questions now.
 - Winning does not tempt that man. This is how he grows: by being defeated, decisively, by greater and greater beings.
 - Love consists in this, that two solitudes protect and touch and greet each other.
 - You, darkness, of whom I am born- I love you more than the flame that limits the world to the circle it illumines and excludes the rest.
 - The future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.
 - But your solitude will be a support and a home for you, even in the midst of very unfamiliar circumstances, and from it you will find all your paths.
 - Let life happen to you. Believe me: life is in the right, always.
 - I want to be with those who know secret things or else alone.
 - Everything terrible is something that needs our love.
 - Once the realization is accepted that even between the closest human beings infinite distances continue, a wonderful living side by side can grow, if they succeed in loving the distance between them which makes it possible for each to see the other whole against the sky.
 - You must change your life.
 - You must give birth to your images. They are the future waiting to be born. Fear not the strangeness you feel. The future must enter you long before it happens. Just wait for the birth, for the the hour of the new clarity.
 - Our heart always transcends us.
 - If your daily life seems poor, do not blame it; blame yourself that you are not poet enough to call forth its riches; for the Creator, there is no poverty.
 - Being an artist means, not reckoning and counting, but ripening like the tree which does not force its sap and stands confidence in the storms of spring without fear that after them may come no summer.
 - Where I create, there I am true.
 - To be here is immense.
 - Go into yourself. Dig into yourself for a deep answer.
 - What we fight with is so small, and when we win, it makes us small. What we want is to be defeated, decisively, by successively greater things.
 - Is not impermanence the very fragrance of our days?
 - I implore those who love me to love my solitude.
 - Make your ego porous. Will is of little importance, complaining is nothing, fame is nothing. Openness, patience, receptivity, solitude is everything.
 - If we surrendered to earth’s intelligence we could rise up rooted, like trees.
 - I hold this to be the highest task for a bond between two people: that each protects the solitude of the other.
 - Embrace your solitude and love it. Endure the pain it causes, and try to sing out with it. For those near to you are distant...
 - Surely all art is the result of one’s having been in danger, of having gone through an experience all the way to the end, where no one can go any further.
 - Where something becomes extremely difficult and unbearable, there we also stand already quite near its transformation.
 - For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror which we are barely able to endure, and it amazes us so, because it serenely disdains to destroy us. Every angel is terrible.
 - Spring has returned. The Earth is like a child that knows poems.
 - Every happiness is the child of a separation it did not think it could survive.
 - Don’t take my devils away, because my angels may flee too.
 - Life is heavier than the weight of all things.
 - Understand, I’ll slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when I see the pale stars rising, blooming, over the oaks. I’ll pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows with only this one dream: You come too.
 - I live not in dreams but in contemplation of a reality that is perhaps the future.
 - If you will stay close to nature, to its simplicity, to the small things hardly noticeable, those things can unexpectedly become great and immeasurable.
 - Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart...
 - I could give you no advice but this: to go into yourself and to explore the depths where your life wells forth.
 - I love the dark hours of my being. My mind deepens into them. There I can find, as in old letters, the days of my life, already lived, and held like a legend, and understood.
 - Trees do not force their sap, nor does the flower push its bloom.
 - We make our way through Everything like thread passing through fabric, giving shape to images that we ourselves do not know.
 - Take your well-disciplined strengths, stretch them between the two great opposing poles, because inside human beings is where God learns.
 - This is the miracle that happens every time to those who really love: the more they give, the more they possess.
 - I am much too alone in this world, yet not alone enough.
 - A person isn’t who they are during the last conversation you had with them – they’re who they’ve been throughout your whole relationship.
 - Right in the difficult we must have our joys, our happiness, our dreams: there against the depth of this background, they stand out, there for the first time we see how beautiful they are.
 - I have patience for centuries in me and will live as though my time were very big.
 - The point is to live everything.
 - If the angel deigns to come it will be because you have convinced her, not by tears but by your humble resolve to be always beginning; to be a beginner.
 - Strangely, I heard a stranger say, I am with you.
 - We need, in love, to practice only this: letting each other go. For holding on comes easily; we do not need to learn it.
 - This is what the things can teach us: to fall, patiently to trust our heaviness. Even a bird has to do that before he can fly.
 - We are the bees of the invisible. We madly gather the honey of the visible to store it in the great golden hive of the invisible.
 - That’s love: Two lonely persons keep each other safe and touch each other and talk to each other.
 - May what I do flow from me like a river, no forcing and no holding back, the way it is with children.
 - As bees gather honey, so we collect what is sweetest out of all things and build...
 - Nearly everything that matters is a challenge, and everything matters.
 - It is clear that we must embrace struggle. Every living thing conforms to it. Everything in nature grows and struggles in its own way, establishing its own identity, insisting on it at all cost, against all resistance.
 - This is in the end the only kind of courage that is required of us: the courage to face the strangest, most unusual, most inexplicable experiences that can meet us.
 - Those doves below, the ones utterly cared for, never endangered ones, cannot know tenderness.
 - Always trust yourself and your own feelings, as opposed to arguments and discussions. If it turns out that you are wrong, then the natural growth of your inner life will eventually guide you to other insights.
 - The work of the eyes is done. Go now and do the heart-work on the images imprisoned within you.
 - How can I keep my soul in me, so that it doesn’t touch your soul? How can I raise it high enough, past you, to other things?
 - A birdsong can even, for a moment, make the whole world into a sky within us, because we feel that the bird does not distinguish between its heart and the world’s.
 - Perhaps everything terrible is in its deepest being something helpless that wants help from us.
 - It’s possible, I’m moving through the hard veins of heavy mountains, like an arc, alone; I’m so deep inside, I see no end in sight, and no distance: everything is getting near and everything near is turning to stone.
 - Since I’ve learned to be silent, everything has come so much closer to me.
 - She who reconciles the ill-matched threads Of her life, and weaves them gratefully Into a single cloth – It’s she who drives the loudmouths from the hall And clears it for a different celebration.
 - If my devils are to leave me, I’m afraid my angels will take flight as well.
 - Works of Art are of an infinite loneliness.
 - Resolve to be always beginning-to be a beginner!

 - The artist’s experience lies so unbelievably close to the sexual, to its pain and its pleasure, that the two phenomena are really just different forms of one and the same longing and bliss.
 - Your doubt can become a good quality if you train it. It must become knowing, it must become criticism.
 - But there is much beauty here, because there is much beauty everywhere.
 - Most people have turned their solutions toward what is easy and toward the easiest side of the easy; but it is clear that we must trust in what is difficult; everything alive trusts in it.

 - In the night, I wish to speak with the angel to find out if she recognizes my eyes, if she will ask me: do you see Eden? And I’ll reply: Eden burns.
 - To be loved means to be consumed. To love is to give light with inexhaustible oil. To be loved is to pass away, to love is to endure.
 - Comfort me from wherever you are–alone, we are quickly worn out; if I place my head on the road, let it seem softened by you. Could it be that even from afar we offer each other a gentle breath?
 - Life and death: they are one, at core entwined. Who understands himself from his own strain presses himself into a drop of wine and throws himself into the purest flame.
 - As the arrow endures the string, and in the gathering momentum becomes more than itself. Because to stay is to be nowhere.
 - Ah, not to be cut off, not through the slightest partition shut out from the law of the stars. The inner – what is it? if not the intensified sky, hurled through with birds and deep with the winds of homecoming.
 - I am the rest between two notes which are somehow always in discord.

 - Perhaps somewhere, someplace deep inside your being, you have undergone important changes while you were sad.
 - Do not be bewildered by the surfaces: in the depths all becomes law.
 - In one creative thought a thousand forgotten nights of love revive, filling it with sublimity and exaltation.
 - Bound by conventions, people tend to reach for what is easy. Here we must be unafraid of what is difficult. For all living beings in nature must unfold in their particular way and become themselves despite all opposition.
 - Your preparation for the real world is not in the answers you’ve learned, but in the questions you’ve learned how to ask yourself.
 - We wasters of sorrows! How we stare away into sad endurance beyond them, trying to foresee their end! Whereas they are nothing else than our winter foliage, our sombre evergreen, one of the seasons of our interior year.
 - Ah, how good it is to be among people who are reading!
 - The most visible joy can only reveal itself to us when we’ve transformed it, within.
 - I am touched by your beautiful anxiety about life...
 - Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depth of your heart; confess to yourself you would have to die if you were forbidden to write.

 - The deepest experience of the creator is feminine, for it is experience of receiving and bearing.
 - We must assume our existence as broadly as we in any way can; everything, even the unheard – of, must be possible in it. This is at bottom the only courage that is demanded of us: to have courage for the most strange, the most inexplicable.

 - Be ahead of all parting, as though it already were behind you.
 - Our task is to listen to the news that is always arriving out of silence.

 - Beauty is only the start of bearable terror.
 - Across the moment, aeons speak with aeons. More than we experienced has gone by.

 - In the difficult are the friendly forces, the hands that work on us.
 - We see the brightness of a new page where everything yet can happen.

 - Rose, oh pure contradiction, joy of being No-one’s sleep under so many lids.
 - Music: breathing of statues. Perhaps: silence of paintings. You language where all language ends. You time standing vertically on the motion of mortal hearts.

 - But learning-time is always a long, secluded time, and so loving, for a long while ahead and far on into life, is-solitude, intensified and deepened loneness for him who loves.
 - Oh longing for places that were not Cherished enough in that fleeting hour How I long to make good from afar The forgotten gesture, the additional act.

 - As people used to be wrong about the motion of the sun, so they are still wrong about the motion of the future. The future stands still, it is we who move in infinite space.
 - Joy is a marvelous increasing of what exists, a pure addition out of nothingness.
 - Losing too is still ours; and even forgetting still has a shape in the kingdom of transformation. When something’s let go of, it circles; and though we are rarely the center of the circle, it draws around us its unbroken, marvelous curve.

 - Go into yourself and see how deep the place is from which your life flows.
 - Ultimately, and precisely in the deepest and most important matters, we are unspeakably alone; and many things must happen, many things must go right, a whole constellation of events must be fulfilled, for one human being to successfully advise or help another.
 - Works of art always spring from those who have faced the danger, gone to the very end of an experience, to the point beyond which no human being can go. The further one dares to go, the more decent, the more personal, the more unique a life becomes.

 - Irony: Don’t let yourself be controlled by it, especially during uncreative moments.
 - To all that is used-up, and to all the muffled and dumb creatures in the world’s full reserve, the unsayable sums, joyfully add yourself, and cancel the count.
 - We ignore the gods and fill our minds with trash.
 - One moment your life is a stone in you, and the next moment a star!
 - You are also the physician who must watch over yourself. But in the course of every illness there are many days in which the physician can do nothing but wait.
