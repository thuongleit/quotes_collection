 - Being challenged in life is inevitable, being defeated is optional.
 - We are a product of the choices we make, not the circumstances that we face.
 - If you enter a race and finish last, you are a winner. The loser never entered the race.
 - Coasting only takes you downhill.
 - Lifeâ€™s inevitable changes are like a compulsory roller-coaster ride. You can cower and shut your eyes tight, or you can exult in the thrills.
