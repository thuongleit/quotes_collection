 - Let go of what has passed. Let go of what may come. Let go of what is happening now. Don’t try to figure anything out. Don’t try to make anything happen. Relax, right now, and rest.
 - Realizing that nothing can last, that all is as dreamlike illusion...
 - Don’t recall. Don’t imagine. Don’t think. Don’t examine. Don’t control. Rest.
 - It’s not the appearance that binds you, it’s the attachment to the appearance that binds you.
 - No thought, no reflection, no analysis, no cultivation, no intention; let it settle itself.
 - One torch can dissipate the accumulated darkness of a thousand aeons.
 - It is not the outer objects that entangle us. It is the inner clinging that entangles us.
 - Cut the mind at its root and rest in naked awareness.
