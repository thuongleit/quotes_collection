 - I used to wanna change the world. Now I just wanna leave the room with a little dignity.
 - And things are never okay. It does get better I guess, in that you grow to love yourself if you’re lucky. But it doesn’t get better because life is hard, and people aren’t always nice.
 - The only thing I can really trust is my own self-indulgence.
