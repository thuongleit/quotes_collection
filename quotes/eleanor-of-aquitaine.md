 - In a world where carpenters get resurrected, everything is possible.
 - Trees are not known by their leaves, nor even by their blossoms, but by their fruits.
 - What family doesnâ€™t have its ups and downs?
 - Grief is not very different from illness: in the impetus of its fire it does not recognise lords, it does not fear colleagues, it does not respect or spare anyone, not even itself.
 - My child, seek those things which make for peace. Cease to stir up the King against the Church, and urge upon him a better course of action. If you will promise to do this, I in return promise to entreat the merciful Lord to grant you offspring.
