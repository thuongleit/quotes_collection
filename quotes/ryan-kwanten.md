 - I have very high standards for myself and my career.
 - I’m glad acting sunk its teeth into me, because now I can’t imagine doing anything else.
 - In order to be able to give a girlfriend the amount of time she deserves, you would need time, and I just can’t give her that. So, rather than being selfish or stupid enough to go into a relationship, it’s just been easier to be single.
 - I really do feel like Los Angeles is my home now and, as cliche as this sounds, I felt like I found myself here and I really know who I am now. There was a long period like I was drifting or floating through life, and now I feel like I have a definitive target – and future.
 - Im not a big fan of the gym, I do lots of outdoor aerobics – yoga, swimming, running – but I kinda hate talking about it. We have a term in Australia, it makes you sound like a wanker.
 - I used to get a sort of sociophobia, and I still get it sometimes these days when I’m in a confined space with too many people. It’s not like I freak out or anything, it’s just that I’m far more comfortable in my own company sometimes than being surrounded by one thousand strangers.
 - I like to have a hectic schedule.
 - Sleep has never been a priority in my life.

 - Everyone in life knows what it’s like to be picked on and to feel like an outsider.
 - My life is very much consumed with work.
 - I’m very rarely in the gym. My workouts are predominantly outside, in nature.

 - Don’t feel like you’re alone because you’re not.
 - My mum is about five foot with her hair done. Without it she’s about four foot 10.
 - I’ve been acting for a long time now, but as narcissistic as this sounds – and I don’t mean it to sound – every time I see my name up there, there is real sense of pride.
 - I’m not the kind of guy that inspires madness in people.
 - I don’t necessarily find superheroes in general, for me, that appealing. I’d much prefer to play, if I was to be cast in a superhero film, I’d prefer to play the villain because there’s a reason, there’s a motive behind their madness.
 - As actors, we deal with rejection so much more than any other business. So I don’t care how much of a genius you are, if you don’t have the propensity to be able to get back up every time you get knocked down, then you’re not going to survive.
 - I’m more of a heat-of-the-moment type of guy. A friend will tell me about something coming up, maybe that weekend, and usually not an abundance of thought goes into my doing it.

 - I never want to be that guy at a dinner table saying, ‘I wish I could have dessert.’ I actually went through a stage when I would order dessert first.
 - Money has never been a huge inspiration for me.
 - I’m drawn to a good story, really, as I hope most people are. For me, it’s the story that’s going to stay with you eventually, not necessarily the genre. I go to watch a film because of the story, not because it was a Western or a comedy.
 - I’m not one of those actors who gets physically fit for a role and then loses it all again.
 - It’s easier to promote things, if you have fans.
 - I make about two movies a year outside the ‘True Blood’ schedule. I work on a great show six months a year, then outside that I get to satisfy whatever creative urges I have. It’s a great position, especially for a single guy like me.
 - The fact that ‘True Blood’ affects people in this way is incredible to me – the fact we have to go to such great lengths to hide storylines just proves the cache our show has.
 - I’m fortunate enough with the surfing to be very much at home at the water – my pulse and heart rate are slower in the water than they are on land.
 - One of my favorite actors is Paul Newman. He could tell so much with a single look, whereas some actors would need an entire five page monologue to give off the feeling of what he could say with just a single look.
 - I pride myself on breaking any box that anyone wants to put me in.
 - I’m definitely an elbow-room guy.
 - I love acting, so it’s easy when you have a passion for it. I’ve always found the harder you work, the luckier you get.
 - I’m not really comfortable with who I am to be honest. I feel more free to step into the shoes of somebody else. There’s always an element of me in there but, you know, if you give me a script and some clothes I can do anything. But, as Ryan, I’m a bit of a recluse.
 - I’ve always been relatively reserved with my social encounters.
 - Going out there and promoting myself socially doesn’t really intrigue me. I’d much rather have my work do it for me.
