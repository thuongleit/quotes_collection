 - It’s better to walk alone, than with a crowd going in the wrong direction.
 - Shoot for the moon. If you miss, shoot again.
 - I am my father’s only child. The world knows a two-dimensional Cary Grant. As charming a star and as remarkable a gentleman as he was, he was still a more thoughtful and loving father.
 - Cary Benjamin sleeps dreamily on my stomach as we’re both bonding and recuperating. He’s phenomenal.
 - My son Cary’s generation likely won’t know who my father was, but it’s something nice for him that his grandfather was an icon. I had one chance to pass along that name.
 - Dad was synonymous with his charm and wit and grace, and it was sort of the perfect way to go for him.
 - At some level it’s still hard for me to admit that my father died. I can talk about it and around it, but those two words. ‘He died.’ What can that possibly mean? That I won’t get to hear his voice again?
 - When it comes to Father’s Day, I will remember my dad for both being there to nurture me and also for the times he gave me on my own to cultivate my own interests and to nurture my own spirit.
 - It’s not what your parents give you. It’s what you do with your own stuff.
 - I fell completely in love with acting. I guess I was bitten.
 - Dad has, and had, a deservedly glowing reputation. However, this belief in ‘reputation first’ seems to have given rise to his fears of what might be rumored after his death.
 - It’s something he used to say when he was happy. It could be a very, very simple day. We might be sitting out on the front lawn. Dad loved classical music and we might be listening to some Stravinsky or something and having some tea and eggs. And he’d say, ‘Oh, good stuff, isn’t it?’
 - One of the myths about Dad was that he was mean. That simply wasn’t true. I always found him generous to a fault but he wasn’t reckless with his money, which was rather rare in Hollywood. He’d grown up with nothing and he wasn’t about to fritter it all away.
 - I have a lot of favorite films. I tend to love the silliness of ‘Bringing Up Baby.’ ‘Charade’ is fantastic. ‘His Girl Friday,’ the banter in that, that alone made me want to be a writer.
