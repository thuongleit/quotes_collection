 - What’s a good investment? Go home from work early and spend the afternoon throwing a ball around with your son.
 - It isn’t the rich people’s fault that poor people are poor. Poor people who get an education and work hard in this country will stop being poor. That should be the goal for all poor people everywhere.

 - I don’t believe the most successful people are the ones who got the best grades, got into the best schools, or made the most money.
 - You must take the first step. The first steps will take some effort, maybe pain. But after that, everything that has to be done is real-life movement.
 - Screaming at children over their grades, especially to the point of the child’s tears, is child abuse, pure and simple. It’s not funny and it’s not good parenting. It is a crushing, scarring, disastrous experience for the child. It isn’t the least bit funny.
 - I think a snob would be a person who thinks he is entitled; he has good things in his life and is entitled to them.
