 - For what pleasure can compare the pleasure of bringing joy and hope to other hearts. The more we make others happy the greater will be our own happiness and the deeper our sense of having served humanity.
 - The more we search for ourselves, the less likely we are to find ourselves; and the more we search for God, and to serve our fellow-men, the more profoundly will we become acquainted with ourselves, and the more inwardly assured. This is one of the great spiritual laws of life.
 - Our past is not the thing that matters so much in this world as what we intend to do with the future.
 - We must not only be patient with others, infinitely patient, but also with our own poor selves.
 - The troubles of this world pass, and what we have left is what we have made of our souls, so it is to this we must look to becoming more spiritual, drawing nearer to God, no matter what our human minds and bodies go through.
 - It is not preaching any rules the world wants, but love and action.
 - The time for the destruction of the world and its people hath arrived.
