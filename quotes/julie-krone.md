 - You have to set new goals every day.
 - If the stable gate is closed, climb the fence.
 - The something inside me that always fought to win, that never gave into the pain and that accepted no less than 110 percent has never been gone because that something was simply me.
 - With racing, you never rest on your laurels, and there are no counterfeits.
 - I’ve been in one Derby, and this is my third Belmont. But I’ve never thought of the fact that I haven’t won a Triple Crown race. I’m not like that. I always look at the sunshine of things.
