 - Let me issue and control a nation’s money and I care not who writes the laws.
 - The few who understand the system, will either be so interested from it’s profits or so dependent on it’s favors, that there will be no opposition from that class.
 - I care not who controls a nation’s political affairs, so long as I control her currency.
