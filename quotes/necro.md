 - Bury you with Satan, to hell then I bury ya. I’m like Lucifer the unforgiven, cast out of heaven, I much rather rule in hell than be a servant. A hell on earth survivor means you better be a earner.
 - I’m long and I’m strong! To challenge me would be so wrong!
 - Every man lives. Not every man truly dies.
