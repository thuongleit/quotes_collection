 - If I lay here If I just lay here would you lie with me and just forget the world?
 - Do the things that you always wanted to, without me there to hold you back, don’t think just do, more than anything I want to see you go, take a glorious bite out of the whole world.
 - Somehow everything I own smells of you, and for the tiniest moment it’s all not true.
