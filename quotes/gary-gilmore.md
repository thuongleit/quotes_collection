 - Death is the only inescapable, unavoidable, sure thing. We are sentenced to die the day weâ€™re born.
 - I want freedom and I realize that the only way to get it is to quit breaking the law.
 - One is inspired only in solitude.
 - I stagnated in prison a long time, and I have wasted most of my life.
