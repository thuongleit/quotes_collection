 - Write every day. Don’t ever stop. If you are unpublished, enjoy the act of writing – and if you are published, keep enjoying the act of writing. Don’t become self-satisfied, don’t stop moving ahead, growing, making it new. The stakes are high. Why else would we write?
 - How we fall into grace. You can’t work or earn your way into it. You just fall. It lies below, it lies beyond. It comes to you, unbidden.
 - My life, I realize suddenly, is July. Childhood is June, and old age is August, but here it is, July, and my life, this year, is July inside of July.
 - Nothing will get you into trouble so deep or as sad as faith.
 - The mountains have always been here, and in them, the bears.
 - I’ve heard it said that when you die you enter a room of bright light, and that you can smell bread baking just around the corner.
 - The Ploughmen is part inspired fever-dream, part adventure story, a lyric parable of not just goodand evil but of the vast and beautiful and often lonely country in-between. Kim Zupan is a wonder.
 - Ive lost much of my heart and the spark or fire that once created, or produced, the art of fiction.
 - Fiction is harder for me than nonfiction – more gratifying, as a result, when it succeeds.
 - I think a novelist must be more tender with living or ‘real’ people. The moral imperative of having been entrusted with their story looms before you every day, in every sentence.
 - The heart of it all is mystery, and science is at best only the peripheral trappings to that mystery – a ragged barbed-wire fence through which mystery travels, back and forth, unencumbered by anything so frail as man’s knowledge.
 - The seams, the laminae between the various worlds the past present and future as well as the living and the nonliving may not be as distinct and clear-cut as we have been taught or as our somewhat arbitrary clocks and calendars have led us to believe.
 - Even the largest of my dreams and ambitions, I realize with increasing dismay, were puny, measly, compared to the object of my dreaming. I would not say my life to date has been built overmuch of compromise, but still, it surrounds me.
 - To not pursue the thing one wants would be a waste of one’s life.
 - When you sign on to be an activist in northwest Montana, people in the grocery store will avoid eye contact, particularly if they’re hanging out with outspoken opponents to your views.
 - There are none among us who have not been, even for a moment, cruel to those whom we love most, as if unable, in that moment, to shoulder any longer the magnificent weight and burden, the responsibility, of that love.
 - A novel that features real people is complicated, but in the end, that extra challenge is all for the good.
 - I don’t think I’m a natural novelist. Plot is definitely one of my weaker points. I’ve been working on it a long time, and it’s not getting much better.
 - Nature, and the original system that created us, must always remain somehow with us, the bedrock of our movements and actions. What is our duty? To live a life.
 - Live long enough and all weaknesses will be illuminated, but again perhaps that is not all bad for cannot they then begin to become strengths?
 - The natural world is the only one we have. To try to not see the natural world – to put on blinders and avoid seeing it – would for me seem like a form of madness. I’m also interested in the way landscape shapes individuals and populations, and from that, cultures.
