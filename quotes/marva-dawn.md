 - Without the emotion and willingness of Spirit, our music becomes dry and dusty â€“ without life. Without doctrinal bones as a skeleton, the Body is not enfleshed in a healthy way.
 - If believers worship with gladness and passion, anyone not yet a part of the community certainly will be attracted to the One who is the object of their worship.
 - Let us make sure that the worship services we plan and conduct present that Truth in all its clarity and beauty and goodness.
 - Instead of scrambling for security in national victory and domination, in preparation for war and military aggression, we must relearn the values of cooperation and sharing, of nonviolence and support.
 - Every other religion gives you directions on how to find God, but Jesus takes you to Him.
 - The Christian life consists in what God does for us, not what we do for God.
