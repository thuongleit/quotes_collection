 - We shall never understand peace, justice and the living of life until we recognize that all people are human and that humans are the most precious things on earth.
 - Anything that is conceivable in the human mind is possible.
 - Do they believe their cause so just that they are above and beyond the truth?
 - There are some things we will always own in common. No one will ever homestead an ocean.
