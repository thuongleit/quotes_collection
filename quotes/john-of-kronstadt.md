 - A Christian must always be kind, gracious, and wise in order to conquer evil by good.
 - Love every man in spite of his falling into sin. Never mind the sins, but remember that the foundation of the man is the same – the image of God.

 - Evil and faults are corrected by good, by love, kindness, meekness, humility, and patience.

 - God is nearer to us than any man at every time. He is nearer to me than my raiment, nearer than the air or light, nearer than my wife, father, mother, daughter, son, or friend. I live in Him, soul and body. I breathe in Him, think in Him, feel, consider, intend, speak, undertake, work in Him.

 - The Saviour and the Comforter, two Persons of the Godhead: the One ever saves from sins, and the Other comforts him who is saved. Their very names are taken from their deeds, and are always actually justified. He comforts! The Holy Spirit comforts the believing soul, as a mother comforts her child.
