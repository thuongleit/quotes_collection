 - Some think that by preparing to deal with crises you make them more likely. I think the wiser judgment is the contrary. In this area at least, if you want peace or stability, it’s better to prepare for war or instability.
 - Most consequential choices involve shades of gray, and some fog is often useful in getting things done.
 - The choice is between which mistake is easier to correct: underdoing it or overdoing it.
 - We have parts of our system which are overwhelmed by regulation. It wasn’t the absence of regulation that was the problem. It was despite the presence of regulation you got huge risks built up.
