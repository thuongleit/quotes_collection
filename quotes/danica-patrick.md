 - I’ve never seen myself as a ‘girl driver.’ I’m just a driver.
 - We don’t do things we aren’t good at by nature. I wouldn’t play basketball because I’m only 5? 1". Find what you enjoy – whether it’s racing, flying a helicopter, being a doctor, or stitching clothes together. Once you’ve done that, you have the passion you need.
 - I want to win at everything. I usually don’t like things that I’m not good at, but it doesn’t mean I don’t want to win at them.

 - I’m not tall enough to be a model, but I wish I was 6-foot, because I love it. It’s kind of artsy, and I’m artsy. And I love clothes.

 - I’m a big believer in everybody being themselves. If not doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, that’s great. But if doing a swimsuit calendar is yourself, then you should be able to do it. What I do outside the car adds to who I am and expresses a different side of me.
 - Maybe back in the day you didn’t need to be the greatest looking to be on TV and you didn’t need to speak the best, but in this day and age, I think you need to be the package. You need to look the part for your sponsors, you need to be able to speak the part for the media and to big CEOs.

 - In the Lamborghini I have to avoid certain roads because of pot holes, and there’s nowhere to put my drink, no cup holder. And I’m not going to lie, it looks pretentious. I used to think it was cool to, like, drive it to dinner. Now? Like I really need to be looked at any more.

 - I would tell kids not be like me, but to try and be better than me. Because I always wanted to be better than everyone I was around. That’s what drove me. I wanted to be better than my role models. I’m super competitive.

 - The commitments, schedule and sponsor appearances don’t change. It gets more busy, because you get more popular, and the more popular you are, it actually gets more busy. They’re like, ‘Yeah, let’s use her, she’s hot right now. Let’s do a shoot!’
 - If you want to be the best in your industry you need to have a relentless dedication to your job.
 - The mistake I really learned from was in 2005, leading the Indianapolis 500. I had a decision whether or not to save enough fuel to finish the race – which meant slowing down – or going all-out for the win. I went conservative and saved enough fuel to go to the end but finished fourth.
 - To be honest, when I’m home, every day is a Friday for me. It doesn’t really matter what day it is for me. A lot of my friends actually have time off during the week, and so it doesn’t prohibit me from enjoying myself when I am home on a Monday or a Tuesday.

 - I’d love to do well on a big weekend with people watching and cheering, of course. But it’s not fair to create an expectation level before I know what is realistic. I want to finish as well as possible. Is that top 20? Top 15? Top 25? You just have to play it by ear.

 - The last time I was pulled over was in 2005. I was going 55 in a 35 mile per hour zone – which I don’t understand because you can barely even idle at 35 miles per hour. Anyway, I was ordered to go to traffic school. It was an 8-hour class and really painful.
