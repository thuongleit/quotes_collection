 - The logic of a madman is a sane man’s confusion.
 - I love Hap and Leonard and plan to write more about them, but not exclusively about them. I have always worked in film, or since the eighties, but my screenplays – though I got paid and did screenplays for Ridley Scott and John Irvin and Mark Romanek – seldom got made.
 - Hallowed be thy name, oh Lord – and shotgun do your stuff.
 - I thought I had the world by the tail. It took me a few years to realize the closest I was to having the world by the tail was being a dingle berry on one of its ass hairs.
 - I’m not poor now, but unlike some of my friends who are now rich, I haven’t embraced conservatism and religion. I’m not opposed to religion if you keep it out of my life.
 - I know the Pollock novel. Read it last year and liked it. Daniel Woodrell is awesome. I especially like the book Winter’s Bone, and the film made from it. Larry Brown is terrific, all his work, but for me Joe in particular, also a good film, but a much better novel.
 - I love Crews, but had been writing a long time before I knew of him. I learned of him because a friend thought we were similar. The reason we are is we were both heavily influenced by Flannery O’Conner. She was wonderful.
 - Enjoy it if you do, but don’t tell me how to live or teach it in school, or not allow a woman the right to choose, and so on. Yeah, all of that slips into my work. I even got a death threat the other day for not being pro gun, which just proves my point. They can kiss my ass.
 - There’s no one more obnoxious and self-righteous than the self-made man. And no one more admirable.
 - Let me tell you, if you have never seen an agitated squirrel you have seen very little, nor have you heard much, because the sound of an angry squirrel is not to be forgotten.
 - I had no idea Savage Season was the beginning of a series. I wrote the second one about three years later. The character of Hap wouldn’t stop talking to me, and then there was a third, and over the years nine novels and a collection of stories and some uncollected stories.
 - I would have fought in WW2, so I wasn’t a pacifist in the broader sense. I prefer to be a pacifist, but I think there are exceptions and times to defend yourself or your country, but that war wasn’t one of them.
 - It seems to be the heart of much of my work. I grew up seeing a lot of racism in the South, but I’ve seen it all over the world. Don’t care for it at all. I was poor, so I’m used to the underdog position.
 - We couldn’t get it off the ground as a film, but then we begin to think television, and Lowell pushed it out there and Jim and Nick were anxious to do Hap and Leonard anyway, and I had worked with them before, so it was a perfect story. I love the series. I hope there’s a second.
 - As for the writers who have influenced me they are many. Hemingway, Chandler, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Charles Beaumont, William Goldman, Flannery O’Conner, Carson McCullers, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and so many others. As a kid Kipling and Edgar Rice Burroughs, and Robert E. Howard.
 - I wouldn’t choose conscientious objector and I wouldn’t go to Canada. I did what Hap did and almost went to prison. I think the threw me a bone as the war was winding down, and I think they accepted my sincerity for being against that war.
 - Scott Sigler’s Infected is a bucking pulp pony that throws you this way and that, and just when you think you’ve got your balance, that ole pony bucks the other way. All in all, one hell of an exhilarating ride, and highly recommended.
 - I have finally become my own genre, and now that’s what publishers want. I have a wonderful publisher now, Mulholland, very innovated, very fine people working there.
 - Only our memories allow that some people ever existed. That they mattered, or mattered too much.
 - I wrote for television some, animation. Batman the Animated Series, Superman the Animated Series, Son of Batman, things of that nature were made and I’m happy about that, but now the recent film and TV stuff have validated me, as if that makes any sense.
 - They might have been all-right people doing the best they could, but I got to tell you, you got a dead cat lying in your yard you ought to bury it. That’s my motto.
 - I could always write in a wide variety. My moods change same as reader’s moods change. I really do love writing the historicals, however, but if that’s all I did I would go crazy, same with any of the other kinds of books. I need variety.
 - Don’t try to skin your rabbit and keep it as a pet too.
 - No system is better than another, but some are better for certain people. The person makes a system worthwhile, not the other way around. I blended a lot of systems I had studied over the years, Judo, wrestling, boxing, Hapkido, Kenpo, Thai Boxing, American Kickboxing, Jujitsu, Aikido.
 - It was the kind of talk that made me want to break off a limb and take to whacking her and that bunch of hypocrites across the back of the head.
 - I have always felt validated and it shouldn’t take film to do that for writer, but I’m glad it has. My plan has always been to be read more widely by doing just what I’ve always done. I wanted to break into the mainstream without becoming mainstream.
 - I think I have broken into the mainstream, and I think that may happen in a broader way, but I want to do it on my own terms, not become a standard producer.
