 - Black and white creates a strange dreamscape that color never can.
 - You have to look at the body of work you’re doing and then figure out the best way for people to digest it. You want people to come in and listen to all of it and understand the entire project. I think it’s bad when everyone’s like, “This is how you have to do it.”
 - Usually it seems like either you sacrifice something and a lot of people will pay attention, or you stay true to yourself and appeal to a smaller group of people, but now we’ve managed to do what we felt was the right thing to do in our heart and had it reach a wide audience. It feels very rare.
