 - You make history when you do business.
 - I’m living my life, not buying a lifestyle.
 - Love is something you fall into.
 - I think that art is still a site for resistance and for the telling of various stories, for validating certain subjectivities we normally overlook. I’m trying to be affective, to suggest changes, and to resist what I feel are the tyrannies of social life on a certain level.
 - We are obliged to steal pieces of language, both visual and textual.
 - You want it, you buy it, you forget it.
 - I mean, making art is about objectifying your experience of the world, transforming the flow of moments into something visual, or textual, or musical, whatever. Art creates a kind of commentary.

 - Listen: our culture is saturated with irony whether we know it or not.
 - It’s good to keep in mind that prominence is always a mix of hard work, eloquence in your practice, good timing and fortuitous social relations. Everything can’t be personalized.

 - The so-called language of Barbara Kruger is vernacular language. Obviously, I pick through bits and pieces of it and figure out to some degree how to objectify my experience of the world, using pictures and words that construct and contain me.
 - I’m trying to engage issues of power and sexuality and money and life and death and power. Power is the most free-flowing element in society, maybe next to money, but in fact they both motor each other.

 - There are so many moments and works that influence us in what we do. Movies, music, TV and, most importantly, the profound everydayness of our lives.

 - Do you know why language manifests itself the way it does in my work? It’s because I understand short attention spans.
 - Look, we’re all saddled with things that make us better or worse. This world is a crazy place, and I’ve chosen to make my work about that insanity.
 - Photography has saturated us as spectators from its inception amidst a mingling of laboratorial pursuits and magic acts to its current status as propagator of convention, cultural commodity, and global hobby.
 - Belief is tricky because left to its own devices, it can court a kind of surety, an unquestioning allegiance that fears doubt and destroys difference.
 - I have frequently said, and I will repeat again, in the manner of any well-meaning seriality, that I’m interested in mixing the ingratiation of wishful thinking with the criticality of knowing better.
 - If I bring up political power, personal power, it sounds like they’re my terms, and they’re not.
 - All the gossip and craziness becomes a kind of sustained narrative which, in turn, can become history. It’s scary.
 - Images are made palpable, ironed flat by technology and, in turn, dictate the seemingly real through the representative.

 - Seeing is no longer believing. The very notion of truth has been put into crisis. In a world bloated with images, we are finally learning that photographs do indeed lie.

 - I’m an artist who works with pictures and words. Sometimes that stuff ends up in different kinds of sites and contexts which determine what it means and looks like.

 - I think there are different ways of being rigorous, and I am asking people to be as rigorous in their pleasure as in their criticism.
 - I think pictures and words have the power to make us rich or poor.
 - I think architecture is one of the predominant orderings of social space. It can construct and contain our experiences. It defines our days and nights. It literally puts us in our place.

 - I just say I’m an artist who works with pictures and words.
 - There’s a moment of recognition. It’s that white-light kind of stuff that just “works.” I love that. And you know it when it happens, whether it’s a movie, music, a building, a book.
 - Warhol’s images made sense to me, although I knew nothing at the time of his background in commercial art. To be honest, I didn’t think about him a hell of a lot.
 - I worked with someone else’s photos; I cropped them in whatever way I wanted and put words on top of them. I knew how to do it with my eyes closed. Why couldn’t that be my art?
 - I think people have to set up little battles. They have to demonize people whom they disagree with or feel threatened by. But it’s the ideological framing of the debate that scares me.

 - I’m trying to deal with ideas about histories, fame, hearsay, and how public identities are constructed.
 - The different aspects of my activity, whether it’s writing criticism, or doing visual work that incorporates writing, or teaching, or curating, is all of a single cloth, and I don’t make any separation in terms of those practices.
 - You know, one of the only times I ever wrote about art was the obituary of Warhol that I did for the Village Voice.
 - I think what I’m trying to do is create moments of recognition. To try to detonate some kind of feeling or understanding of lived experience.

 - Although my art work was heavily informed by my design work on a formal and visual level, as regards meaning and content the two practices parted ways.
