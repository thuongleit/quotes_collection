 - I’ll never kick dogs, I’ll never hurt a child, I’ll never slap a woman – three things I won’t do on film.
 - One day, something happened. It made life very precious to me.
 - I tried to learn the languages – Italian, Spanish, and German – not to successfully. Working on a European set isn’t a hell of a lot different from working on an American set.
 - Being born with a pair of beady eyes was the best thing that ever happened to me.
 - You go where the work is. It can be in my own back yard, Israel, Spain, or Yugoslavia. We may have the greatest technical efficiency in the world, but our artistic values are not necessarily the best.
 - I don’t care where I work. Films are an international business – not an American institution.
 - Audiences just naturally hate me on screen. I could play a role in a tuxedo, and people would think I was rotten. You can do much more with a villain part.
 - I’d like to do more comedy, but i think my forte is still in the heavy. I’d love to do a comic lead, a musical.
