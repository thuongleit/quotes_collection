 - God, send me an angel from the heavens above. Send me an angel to heal my broken heart from being in love, ’cause all I do is cry. God, send me an angel to wipe the tears from my eyes.
 - I started playing instruments. Writing didn’t come until later. I didn’t know how to play a keyboard but I’d listen to hits off the radio, learn them, then my hands would be ready to play.
 - When I see something I end up making a song about it and that’s the way it is. There have been plenty of times when I’ve been in the studio and they were like, “Hey, why don’t you make a song about such and such,” and I just can’t. I’ve gotta have it in my heart.
