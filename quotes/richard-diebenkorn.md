 - Don’t be a Pollyanna!
 - Attempt what is not certain. Certainty may or may not come later. It may then be a valuable delusion.
 - My freedom will be so much the greater and more meaningful, the more narrowly I limit my field of action and the more I surround myself with obstacles.
 - Do search, but in order to find other than what is searched for.
 - Mistakes can’t be erased, but they move you from your present position.
 - I trust the symbol that is arrived at in the making of the painting. Meaningful symbols aren’t invented as such, they are made or discovered as symbol later.
 - My freedom consists in my moving about within the narrow frame that I have assigned myself for each one of my undertakings.
 - All paintings start out of a mood, out of a relationship with things or people, out of a complete visual impression.

 - I would like the colors, their shapes and positions to be arrived at in response to and dictated by the condition of the total space at the time they are considered.
 - I have found in my still-life work that I seem to be able to tell what objects are important to me by what tends to stay in the painting as it develops.
 - I want painting to be difficult to do.
 - As a work progresses, its power to elicit and dictate response mounts. There seems to be an optimum moment when this power is at its greatest which just precedes the point where ‘elicit’ is no longer apt usage. ‘Dictates’ is the word for this condition and tyranny is the adversary.
