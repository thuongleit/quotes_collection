 - All fear is imaginary, reality is its antidote.
 - Necessary, since every moment in our lives is marked by death, like a shadow from another realm, it appear to us like a vanishing point for everything. How can one meditate on live without meditating too on its brevity, its precariousness, its fragility?
 - Atheism is a way of humility. Itâ€™s to think oneself to be an animal, as we are actually and to allow oneself to become human.
