 - If you can’t say it clearly, you don’t understand it yourself.
 - The Intentionality of the mind not only creates the possibility of meaning, but limits its forms.
 - There is no success or failure in Nature.
 - How do we get from electrons to elections and from protons to presidents?
 - We do not live in several different, or even two different, worlds, a mental world and a physical world, a scientific world and a world of common sense. Rather, there is just one world; it is the world we all live in, and we need to account for how we exist as part of it.
 - Dualism makes the problem insoluble; materialism denies the existence of any phenomenon to study, and hence of any problem.
 - Nowadays nobody bothers, and it is considered in slightly bad taste to even raise the question of God’s existence. Matters of religion are like matters of sexual preference: they are not discussed in public, and even the abstract questions are discussed only by bores.

 - The reason that no computer program can ever be a mind is simply that a computer program is only syntactical, and minds are more than syntactical. Minds are semantical, in the sense that they have more than a formal structure, they have a content.
 - Where questions of style and exposition are concerned I try to follow a simple maxim: if you can’t say it clearly you don’t understand it yourself.

 - There are clear cases in which understanding literally applies and clear cases in which it does not apply; and these two sorts of cases are all I need for this argument.
 - I want to block some common misunderstandings about understanding: In many of these discussions one finds a lot of fancy footwork about the word understanding.
 - My car and my adding machine understand nothing: they are not in that line of business.
 - Many people mistakenly suppose that the essence of consciousness is that of a control mechanism.
 - Whatever is referred to must exist. Let us call this the axiom of existence.
 - I will argue that in the literal sense the programmed computer understands what the car and the adding machine understand, namely, exactly nothing.
