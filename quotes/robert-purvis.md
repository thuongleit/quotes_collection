 - I am proud to be an American Citizen.
 - It is the safeguard of the strongest that he lives under a government which is obliged to respect the voice of the weakest.
 - I elect to stay on the soil of which I was born and on the plot of ground which I have fairly bought and honestly paid for. Don’t advise me to leave, and don’t add insult to injury by telling me it’s for my own good; of that I am to be the judge.
