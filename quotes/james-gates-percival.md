 - There are moments of life that we never forget, which brighten and brighten as time steals away.
 - Green sods are all their monument; and yet it tells A nobler history than pillared piles, Or the eternal pyramids.
 - The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness.
 - Sweet flower, thou tellest how hearts as pure and tender as thy leaf, as low and humble as thy stem, will surely know the joy that peace imparts.
 - How awful is that hour when con, science stings.
 - I am one who finds within me a nobility that spurns the idle pratings of the great, and their mean boasts of what their fathers were, while they themselves are fools effeminate.
 - The thundering voice that wrings, in one dark, damning moment, crimes of years!
 - Night steals on; and the day takes its farewell, like the words of a departing friend, or the last tone of hallowed music in a ministerâ€™s aisles, heard when it floats along the shade of elms, in the still place of graves.
