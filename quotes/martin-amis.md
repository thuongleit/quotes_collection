 - When the past is forgotten, the present is unforgettable.

 - My 12-year-old daughter said to me, “Enough with the subtitles, Daddy, for crying out loud.” Because they always seem to cloud the issue rather than clarify it.
 - Probably human cruelty is fixed and eternal. Only styles change.

 - There’s a lot of anti-intellectualism in Britain. And the writer’s views on this or that are really of less importance, as they see it, than that of the man in the street.
 - No novel has ever changed anything, as far as I can see. And the great satirists, like Swift and Dickens, tend to write about abuses and injustices that have already been partially corrected – you write about it after it’s over.
 - Everyone is right up there at the very brink of their pain limit.
 - You use a different part of your heart with girls.
 - Insects are what neurosis would sound like, if neurosis could make a noise with its nose.

 - Don’t dumb down; always write for your top five percent of readers.

 - Bullets cannot be recalled. They cannot be uninvented. But they can be taken out of the gun.
 - We all have names we don’t know about.
 - Life is made of fear. Some people eat fear soup three times a day. Some people eat fear soup all the meals there are. I eat it sometimes. When they bring me fear soup to eat, I try not to eat it, I try to send it back. But sometimes I’m too afraid to and have to eat it anyway.
 - He was in a terrible state- that of consciousness.
 - Vidal gives the impression of believing that the entire heterosexual edifice – registry offices, ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ the disposable diaper – is just a sorry story of self-hypnosis and mass hysteria: a hoax, a racket, or sheer propaganda.

 - At its grandest, political correctness is an attempt to accelerate evolution.
 - More will mean worse.
 - You can’t be up the reader’s ass, as many a writer I think is – cute as hell, ingratiating as hell. But that’s not loving the reader in the right way. That’s toadying to the reader.
 - Like fundamentalist Judaism and medieval Christianity, Islam is totalist. That is to say, it makes a total claim on the individual.

 - You see tragedy requires persons of heroic stature. It works on the principle of people being more than humansuper-humanand also being only too human. But there just aren’t many great figures around now, so the tragic mechanisms can’t work.
 - Much modern prose is praised for its terseness, its scrupulous avoidance of curlicue, etcetera. But I don’t feel the deeper rhythm there. I don’t think these writers are being terse out of choice. I think they are being terse because it’s the only way they can write.
 - I would say that the writers I like and trust have at the base of their prose something called the English sentence. An awful lot of modern writing seems to me to be a depressed use of language. Once, I called it “vow-of-poverty prose.” No, give me the king in his countinghouse. Give me Updike.
 - Who would want the socialist Utopia? Especially if you were at all artistic – you want all those inequalities, because that’s what makes life interesting.

 - It’s hard to make progress with grief.
 - On any longer view, man is only fitfully committed to the rational – to thinking, seeing, learning, knowing. Believing is what he’s really proud of.

 - I say the sentences again and again in my head until they sound right.
 - Is there any good reason why we cannot extend our multi-cultural generosity to include another dimension? That of time. The past, too, is another country.

 - Screw-top wine has improved the quality of life by about ten percent, wouldn’t you say?
 - When I see a lot of young faces in the audience, it’s just sort of sinking in how important that is. Because you’re old enough now to identify them very strongly as being young – whereas before, of course they were young, because you were young. Now it’s not like that.

 - He was an artist when he saw society: it never crossed his mind that society had to be like this; had any right, had any business being like this. A car in the street. Why? Why cars? This is what an artist has to be: harassed to the point of insanity or stupefaction by first principles.
