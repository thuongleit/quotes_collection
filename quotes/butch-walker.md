 - I’m not stupid, I realise selling it is not as important as it used to be that way, I think it’s more important to get your music out there and if people want to hear it an mp3 form or whatever I’m fine with that, I just don’t enjoy the sound of it at home for personal taste.
 - I’m a big vinyl listener, I’m a big audiophile. I have a really nice stereo set up at home with a hi-fi and really nice turntable and it’s a big deal to me to listen to music in it’s purest form like that.
 - I would have never thought in a million years that I would appeal to an Avril fan. But I’m glad that I do because a lot of them aren’t jaded or cynical.
 - It’s just for some reason I’ve got just as many fans that only like me when I’m yelling or being funny or whatnot, and jumping up and down on a pogo stick while playing a fancy lead guitar. And they get mad when I sing a heartfelt emotional song and if there’s an album full of them.
 - I guess the internet and the power of people finding things out for themselves is great.
