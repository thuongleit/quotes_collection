 - When you finally embrace the gift of your sexual orientation it IS the end; the end of shame, fear and oppression. You leave the darkness of the closet and begin a life of honesty, authenticity and freedom.
 - My morality and faith are choices. My sexual orientation however isn’t.
 - When we choose to live authentically we chip away at others prisons of pretend and create an opportunity for them to walk out of darkness into freedom.
 - It’s better to live one day on this planet being true to yourself than an entire lifetime which is a lie.
 - The enemy is not individuals, churches, ‘ex-gay’ organisations or political parties; the enemy is ignorance. Change is created by focusing our energies on overcoming the latter instead of attacking the former.
