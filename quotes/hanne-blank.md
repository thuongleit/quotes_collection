 - There is no wrong way to have a body.
 - Real women are fat. And thin. And neither. And both. And otherwise.
 - You have the right to not have to constantly manage how you look for other people’s sake. You aren’t here to decorate the world for other people. You’re here to live in it for yourself, no matter what that looks like.
 - We don’t just want what we want because we want it; we want what we want because that’s what we’ve learned to want.
