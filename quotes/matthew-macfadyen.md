 - No one will guide you in the right direction, in the end you have to learn for yourself. You have to grow up yourself.
 - Nobody’s really unsympathetic, I think. People do good and bad things. If a character’s totally unsympathetic, they’re not real and I’m not interested. Even the real monsters have to have a spark of something you can relate to.
 - I was quite a shy child. I would get terribly nervous and throw up before my birthday party. And then I would be fine. I feel the same now. I get nervous, then it’s fine.
 - I just loved the whole idea of being an actor.
 - Nobody’s just arrogant. I’ve met people who are embattled and dismissive, but when you get to know them, you find that they’re vulnerable – that that hauteur or standoffishiness is because they’re pedaling furiously underneath.
 - The actor in me would always like to be more dashing, or slimmer, or have nicer hair.
 - I can’t throw books away. My wife is always telling me to get rid of some.

 - I did four or five years in telly, and by the end of it was drained. I was a bit sick of myself. I didn’t feel like an actor anymore. That sounds silly, but when you’re doing a play you’re using different muscles, and it blew all the cobwebs away.
 - I’ve worried more and more as the years have gone on. The more you’re seen to be doing well, the more stress there is. You feel you ought to consider things more, and be more fussy – there’s further to fall. All these little worries.

 - I would hate not to do a play every couple of years. I think it’s not me.
 - I think people ought to do what they feel useful at the time. If I do things because I ought to do them, I switch off.
 - The security comes, as an actor, in knowing that you’re not in control. If you try to control your career, or how people perceive you, you’ll make yourself unhappy, because life doesn’t work like that. So much is luck. It’s much better to let yourself off, to think, ‘There’s nothing I can do.’
