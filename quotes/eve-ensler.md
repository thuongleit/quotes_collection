 - Go so far away that you stop being afraid of not coming back.
 - Give voice to what you know to be true, and do not be afraid of being disliked or exiled. I think that’s the hard work of standing up for what you see.
 - Cherish your solitude. Take trains by yourself to places you have never been. Sleep out alone under the stars.
 - The clitoris is pure in purpose. It is the only organ in the body designed purely for pleasure.
 - Everything you deny is actually killing you on some level. You see something, you feel something wrong with your body, you pretend it’s not happening, it goes on, it grows, it gets worse.
 - I think so much of neoliberalism and capitalism has caused people to live in a state of greed, fear and consumption that is covering up so much of what we really want.
 - When you bring consciousness to anything, things begin to shift.
 - One of the most radical things women can do is to love their body.
 - Geography does not define you – love does.
 - Unless men are active allies, we’ll never end violence against women and girls.
 - Good is towing the line, being behaved, being quiet, being passive, fitting in, being liked, and great is being messy, having a belly, speaking your mind, standing up for what you believe in, fighting for another paradigm, not letting people talk you out of what you know to be true.
 - Security is elusive. It’s impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure.
 - I wake up every day and I think, ‘I’m breathing! It’s a good day.’
 - Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn’t exist.
 - When I wrote ‘The Good Body,’ I turned 40 and suddenly had this stomach. It seemed like the end of the world. Because I didn’t value my body. I was constantly judging it, but I also didn’t live in it.
 - What happens when someone throws you against a wall or tells you you’re a jackass or puts you down or calls you bad names? It goes into your body. We hold it in our body. If we don’t have a way to let that go and release that, it becomes sickness eventually.
 - Stop trying to fix your body. It was never broken.
 - Terence McKenna says, “The culture is not your friend.” I am not sure we can change this culture. But I think we can rise above it and create a new world. That’s why I so deeply believe in alternative spaces. That’s why I believe in the power of art and activism.
 - The devastation of neoliberalism is so multi-fold, whether it’s violence against women or desperate economic inequality or the destruction of the planet.
 - We live in a racist world. Everywhere there is racism. We say to White people, “You really have to examine how you behave in the world. You are responsible for deconstructing internalized racism and being part of a ongoing process of decolonizing yourself.”
 - If the theatre has taught me anything, it’s that when things change in the body, in the body politic, in the body of the world, in the body of the earth, in the body of the person, there’s change. You never go back.
 - Denial is really death. People think that when you’re connected with other people it’s more painful. The opposite is true. When you’re connected to the river you have despair, but you also have joy, and there’s a flow in the river.
 - I think the greatest illusion we have is that denial protects us. It’s actually the biggest distortion and lie. In fact, staying asleep is what’s killing us.
 - I am so grateful to be alive. It’s ridiculous to be alive.
 - Writing and giving voice to what I am feeling makes me happy. And supporting people in finding their voice, passion, outrage and resistance. There is nothing better than that.
 - I think we have made progress. There’s no doubt about it, we have moved forward. But there’s some essential, core thing that has not been deconstructed. And I’m telling you, it’s connected to the body. I know it is.
 - Anorexia was my attempt to have control over my body and manipulate my body and starve my body and shape my body. It was not a very good relationship. It was the sort of relationship my father had to my body. It was a tyrannical, “you’ll do what I tell you” relationship.
 - I want to touch you in real time not find you on YouTube, I want to walk next to you in the mountains not friend you on Facebook.
 - The people who are on the front lines every day in hospitals, nurses, the people who are running clinics, the people who are taking care of your children, those are the people who are the lovers of the world, are the good of the world.
 - When you listen to other women’s stories, you begin to understand your own better, and you begin to find ways back through and with each other.
 - Once you are diagnosed with cancer, time changes. It both speeds up insanely and stops altogether.
 - Cancer was the most terrifying, arduous, painful thing, but it was also a profound gift in the sense that I was holding so much in my body for so many years that was dark and terrifying which was preventing my coming back into myself.
 - I believe in fierce love, pushing the edge, calling the robbers, the corporates, the elites, the pillagers and insanely wealthy to task, going whatever distance we need to go now to protect our earth and each other.
 - The minute someone tells you you have cancer, it’s kind of like you die. You really do die. It’s like you get that you’re mortal.
 - I live with that contradiction daily. It is a constant struggle. I struggle very deeply. I don’t think I’ve said this to anyone, but I’ve wondered if I just want to give up this world and live in the Congo and just be there. But I don’t think that’s what they need from me.
 - Looking at it, I started crying. Maybe it was knowing that I had to give up the fantasy, the enormous life consuming fantasy, that someone or something was going to do this for me – the fantasy that someone was coming to lead my life, to choose direction, to give me orgasms.
 - Theater has an incredible capacity to move people to social change, to address issues, to inspire social revolution.
 - Women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth, we come from them. They are mothers, they are visionaries, they are the future. If we can figure out how to make women feel safe and honor women, it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
 - I think being an activist and an artist is an interesting contradiction, because so often they are at odds with one another. When you write as an artist you have to clean the palate of your own politics in creating characters and activism is kind of the exact opposite.
 - I am not saying people shouldn’t be held accountable for terrible acts. But holding people in prisons does not necessarily make them responsible or accountable. It makes them bad. It makes them evil. It puts an end to any process of transformation. It hardens them spiritually and psychologically.
 - People didn’t feel so much shame around it and that they didn’t feel so much humiliation around it. And the other thing that people have given me a lot of feedback about – something I’m very excited about – is all the stuff around chemo as an “empathetic warrior.”
 - I’m a nomad. I have a place in New York in the Flatiron District, and I have a place in Paris in Ile Saint-Louis, and I spend a lot of time in Congo.
 - I believe in irony. And if V-Day has taught me anything, it’s that if you go out with artistic, outrageous irony and humor, people are drawn to it.
 - Since cancer, I feel like I have dreams rather than ambitions, visions rather than plans.
 - I think what’s been true across the board is the universal patriarchy, the fear of women ever being born back into complete sexuality and life-force. This manifests itself in different cultural variances, but that’s really what’s going on everywhere.
 - I think we need to teach pleasure. What beautiful touch means. What reciprocity means. What being connected and what intimacy means. Boys get out there at a young age and the performance posturing is so great and ends up being hard and aggressive.
 - Danger lurks when people are dissociated and detached from their own story or feelings.
 - We have not yet made violence against women abnormal, extraordinary, unacceptable. We have not yet come to see it as a pathological issue.
 - There is a global epidemic where one out of three women will be beaten or sexually assaulted in their lifetimes? How are we going to build a future of love and connection? And why would this not be of utmost concern to men?
 - The cancer in me became an awareness of the cancer that is everywhere. The cancer of cruelty, the cancer of carelessness, the cancer of greed.
 - I think the world is always improving and always not improving. I think that both are simultaneously happening all the time. I don’t think it’s one motion unfortunately – I wish we could say it’s better, better, better – but I think it’s better, bad, better, bad – you know?
 - I have been a depressed person most of m life. I was always in the throes of self-hatred.
 - Between the combination of Judeo-Christian religious ‘be good be good be good’ and Capitalist ‘something’s wrong with you, buy this’ and the parental upbringing, which is ‘you’re wrong, you’re not thin enough, you’re not smart enough’ I mean, hello! We don’t have a shot.
 - The only point of having power it seems to me is to empower others. The only point of leadership is to inspire.
 - I’d stop calling it “chemotherapy.” I’d call it “transformational juice.” Infusion suites would become “transformational suites” or “journey rooms.”
 - The love is all around us. I made a life of love.
 - Money doesn’t make you special, it makes you lucky. Be generous, be crazy, be outrageous.
 - Dance is holy, sexual, and it’s a way of being very powerful and a little dangerous without being violent.

 - If you are divided from your body, then you are divided from the body of the world.
 - For many years now, I feel like my own body struggle has been linked and connected with women I meet in the world. I think we’re in this together.
 - Why don’t we bring everyone up to be caring and compassionate, to believe that we are connected with everyone and everything around us?
 - I feel very passionate that we need CAT scanners in every country in the world. There’s not a CAT scanner in all of eastern Congo. People don’t use the word “cancer” because they don’t get diagnosed. They just die.
 - I think to be cut off from your heart is the greatest tyranny in the world.
 - I think all my work’s been about how do women get back into our bodies; how do men get back. We’re all disassociated.
 - I got to a nine-hour surgery, I lost lots of body parts and rearranged, I got really months of infection that I lost 30 pounds. But the idea of pumping poison into my bloodstream just – I couldn’t, I couldn’t.
 - It seems to me there’s this tyranny that’s not accidental or incidental, to make women feel compelled to look like somebody they’re not. I think the effort is being made to get us to turn our time and attention to this instead of important political issues.
 - I really want to help stop violence toward women.
 - The mechanism of violence is what destroys women, controls women, diminishes women and keeps women in their so-called place.
 - I think so much of my early life, even though I grew up White and middle class, I was completely shattered by the horrifically violent atmosphere I grew up in. I am a consequence of violence. That opened a door to many realities that I would not have experienced had I not survived what I did.
 - I think that anytime you get clear about what your mission is or what your focus wants to be, things start to come together in your life.
 - Some days I would get so exhausted, nauseous, in pain – just from going back through things. It’s almost as if I had the experience and then the meta-experience.
 - I think violence against women in America has become ordinary – it’s been made absolutely acceptable.
 - If you are connected to your own internal being, it is very hard to be screwing and destroying and hurting another human being, because you’ll be feeling what they’re feeling. If you’re separated, it’s not a hard thing to do at all.
 - I honestly never understood how violence against women became a women’s issue. 95 percent of the violence men are doing to women.
 - I think one of the problems with the capitalist mainstream is this: no matter what you create to respond or resist it they will buy it.
 - I came out of the nine-hour surgery and I had tubes in every direction, and those nurses at the Mayo Clinic, I could cry for four days at the kindness of those nurses. The care, the detail of the care, the attention that just never wavered, never complained. The love.

 - Well, the tyranny of masculinity and the tyranny of patriarchy I think has been much more deadly to men than it has to women. It hasn’t killed our hearts. It’s killed men’s hearts. It’s silenced them; it’s cut them off.
