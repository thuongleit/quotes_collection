 - Love is an earthquake that relocates the center of the universe.
 - Real love is always fated. It has been arranged before time. It is the most meticulously prepared of coincidences. And fate, of course, is simply a secular term for the will of God, and coincidence for His grace.
 - There is no trick of a magician or spell of a witch doctor, no drug or mesmerism or bribery or torture or coercion that can compare in power with the force for change unleashed in the human breast through the touch of love.
 - It is easier to diminish God than it is to enlarge one’s heart.
 - To keep a vow, means not to keep from breaking it, but rather to devote the rest of one’s life to discovering what the vow means, and to be willing to change and to grow accordingly.
 - True worship has less to do with offering sacrifices than with being a sacrifice ourselves.
 - Pure suffering has a consciousness, a tongue, a heart all its own and even the memory of it is but a pale unreality when compared with the actual experience.
 - How tragic that the very thing that could set us free-playing the fool-is the thing we will not do. When we’re afraid to be fools, we end up being afraid to be anything.
