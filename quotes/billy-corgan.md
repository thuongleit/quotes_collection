 - I hate how in magazine pictures, they always stick me somewhere in the back. It means they don’t think I’m the cute one.

 - I’ve rarely done anything that’s overtly self-destructive without consciously knowing what I’m doing. And then of course, the astute journalist jumps forward and says, “Why are you being calculated?” Calculated seems to assume a sinister intent. My intent is always for artistic effect.

 - Beware of those angels with their wings glued on.

 - When you move artistically, the natural inclination is to denounce everything that’s gone before.

 - You have to be willing to deal with the ups and downs of the music, the ups and downs of the audience.
 - People try to make a big deal, like I don’t want to play my old songs. That’s not it. I don’t want to play my old songs if that’s my only option. That’s a different thing.
 - You’ve got to be ready to be in a great relationship.
