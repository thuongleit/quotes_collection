 - A traveler enters the world into which he travels, but a tourist brings his own world with him and never sees the one he’s in.
 - At a certain point memory becomes a beach strewn with landmines, all life’s many losses buried in those sands.
 - The last best hope of life is that at some point during living it, all that you did wrong will suddenly teach you to do right.
