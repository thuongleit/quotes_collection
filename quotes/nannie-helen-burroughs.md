 - To struggle and battle and overcome and absolutely defeat every force designed against us is the only way to achieve.
 - At times we feel wounded, hurt, disappointed, disgusted, resentful, sick of it all. At other times we feel skeptical, outraged, robbed, beaten. We chafe, hate, overlook. Then again we feel like ignoring, defying and fighting for every right that belongs to us as human beings.
 - Education and justice are democracy’s only life insurance.
 - Anything that is as old as racism is in the blood line of the nation. It’s not any superficial thing-that attitude is in the blood and we have to educate about it.
 - Aspire to be, and all that we are not God will give us credit for trying.
