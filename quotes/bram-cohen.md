 - Lawyers can’t tell you you can’t do something. They can warn you about risks, and in extreme cases tell you that something is such a bad idea you’ll need to get someone other than them to do it but the judgment call of whether the risk is worth it is the entrepreneur’s.
 - You get so tired of having your work die. I just wanted to make something that people would actually use.

 - I’ve accomplished more working on my own than I ever did as part of a team.
