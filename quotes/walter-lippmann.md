 - The common interests very largely elude public opinion entirely, and can be managed only by a specialised class.
 - Private property was the original source of freedom. It still is its main bulwark.
 - Creative ideas come to the intuitive person who can face up to the insecurity of looking beyond the obvious.
 - We are told about the world before we see it. We imagine most things before we experience them. And those preconceptions, unless education has made us acutely aware, govern deeply the whole process of perception.
 - But what is propaganda, if not the effort to alter the picture to which men respond, to substitute one social pattern for another?
 - There are at least two distinct selves, the public and regal self, the private and human.

 - A really good diplomat does not go in for victories, even when he wins them.
 - In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs.

 - Run against the grain of a nation’s genius and see where you get with your laws.
 - The public must be put in its place, so that it may exercise its own powers, but no less and perhaps even more, so that each of us may live free of the trampling and the roar of a bewildered herd.
 - The news and the truth are not the same thing.
 - The public interest may be presumed to be what men would choose if they saw clearly, thought rationally, acted disinterestedly and benevolently.
 - Between ourselves and our real natures we interpose that wax figure of idealizations and selections which we call our character.
 - There is nothing disastrous in the temporary nature of our ideas. They are always that. But there may very easily be a train of evil in the self-deception which regards them as final. I think God will forgive us our skepticism sooner than our Inquisitions.

 - In a democracy, the opposition is not only tolerated as constitutional, but must be maintained because it is indispensable.

 - The facts we see depend on where we are placed and the habits of our eyes.
 - The news is not a mirror of social conditions, but the report of an aspect that has obtruded itself.
 - We must remember that in time of war what is said on the enemy’s side of the front is always propaganda and what is said on our side of the front is truth and righteousness, the cause of humanity and a crusade for peace.
 - Yet this corporate being, though so insubstantial to our senses, binds, in Burkes words, a man to his country with ties which though light as air, are as strong as links of iron. That is why young men die in battle for their countrys sake and why old men plant trees they will never sit under.
 - When distant and unfamiliar and complex things are communicated to great masses of people, the truth suffers a considerable and often a radical distortion. The complex is made over into the simple, the hypothetical into the dogmatic, and the relative into an absolute.
 - The present crisis of Western democracy is a crisis in journalism.

 - A large plural society cannot be governed without recognizing that, transcending its plural interests, there is a rational order with a superior common law.
 - The unions are the first feeble effort to conquer the industrial jungle for democratic life. They may not succeed, but if they don’t their failure will be a tragedy for civilization, a loss of cooperative effort, a baulking of energy, and the fixing in American life of a class-structure.

 - True opinions can prevail only if the facts to which they refer are known; if they are not known, false ideas are just as effective as true ones, if not a little more effective.
 - Social movements are at once the symptoms and the instruments of progress. Ignore them and statesmanship is irrelevant; fail to use them and it is weak.
 - The unexamined life, said Socrates, is unfit to be lived by man. This is the virtue of liberty, and the ground on which we may justify our belief in it, that it tolerates error in order to serve truth.
 - Our conscience is not the vessel of eternal verities. It grows with our social life, and a new social condition means a radical change in conscience.
 - Our life is managed from behind the scenes: we are actors in dramas that we cannot interpret. Of almost no decisive event can we say: this was our own choosing. We happen upon careers, necessity pushing, blind inclination pulling. If we stop to think we are amazed that we should be what we are.
 - The wiser a man is, it seems to me, the more vividly he can see the future as part of the evolving present. He doesn’t break the flow of life, he directs it, hastens it, but preserves its continuity.
 - Inevitably our opinions cover a bigger space, a longer reach of time, a greater number of things, than we can directly observe. They have, therefore, to be pieced together out of what others have reported and what we can imagine.

 - He has honor if he holds himself to an ideal of conduct though it is inconvenient, unprofitable, or dangerous to do so.
