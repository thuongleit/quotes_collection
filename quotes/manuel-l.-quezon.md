 - I want our people to be like a molave tree, strong and resilient, standing on the hillsides, unafraid of the rising tide, lighting and the storm, confident of its strength.
 - I prefer a government run like hell by Filipinos to a government run like heaven by Americans.
 - My loyalty to my party ends where my loyalty to my country begins.
 - I would rather have a country run like hell by Filipinos than a country run like heaven by the Americans, because however a bad Filipino government might be, we can always change it.
