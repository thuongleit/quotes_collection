 - There is a much more exact correspondence between the natural and moral world than we are apt to take notice of.
 - The principle we call self-love never seeks anything external for the sake of the thing, but only as a means of happiness or good: particular affections rest in the external things themselves.
 - Thus self-love as one part of human nature, and the several particular principles as the other part, are, themselves, their objects and ends, stated and shown.

 - Every man hath a general desire of his own happiness; and likewise a variety of particular affections, passions, and appetites to particular external objects.
