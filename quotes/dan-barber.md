 - The greatest lesson came with the realization that good food cannot be reduced to single ingredients. It requires a web of relationships to support it.
 - Clean plates don’t lie.

 - The history of food has never had a better biographer. Required reading for anyone who eats.
 - For the past 50 years, we’ve been fishing the seas like we clear-cut forests. It’s hard to overstate the destruction. Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love – the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish – they’ve collapsed.
