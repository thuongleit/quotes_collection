 - The way I deal with arthritis is to keep moving. As long as I can play hard tennis, as long as I can ski or ride a horse – all kinds of things can come your way. As long as you can, do it. People who retire die. My dad retired and died shortly after. Just keep moving.

 - Health food may be good for the conscience but Oreos taste a hell of a lot better.
