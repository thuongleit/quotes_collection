 - We know not through our intellect but through our experience.
 - The body is our general medium for having a world.
 - The flesh is at the heart of the world.
 - Language transcends us and yet we speak.
 - Our body is not in space like things; it inhabits or haunts space. It applies itself to space like a hand to an instrument. And when we wish to move about, we do not move the body as we move an object.
 - Our own body is in the world as the heart is in the organism: it keeps the visible spectacle constantly alive, it breathes life into it and sustains it inwardly, and with it forms a system.
 - Visible and mobile, my body is a thing among things; it’s caught in the fabric of the world, and its cohesion is that of a thing. But, because it moves itself and sees, it holds things in a circle around itself.
 - Speech is not a means in the service of an external end. It contains its own rule of usage, ethics, and view of the world, as a gesture sometimes bears the whole truth about a man.
 - The body is to be compared, not to a physical object, but rather to a work of art.
 - We should be sensitive to the thread of silence from which the tissue of speech is woven.
 - The world is nothing but ’world-as-meaning.
 - My own words take me by surprise and teach me what to think.
 - I may speak many languages, but there remains one in which I live.
 - I will never know how you see red and you will never know how I see it. But this separation of consciousness is recognized only after a failure of communication, and our first movement is to believe in an undivided being between us.
 - The phenomenological world is not the bringing to explicit expression of a pre-existing being, but the laying down of being. Philosophy is not the reflection of a pre-existing truth, but, like art, the act of bringing truth into being.
 - Nothing determines me from outside, not because nothing acts upon me, but, on the contrary, because I am from the start outside myself and open to the world.
 - We must therefore rediscover, after the natural world, the social world, not as an object or sum of objects, but as a permanent field or dimension of existence.
 - The photograph keeps open the instants which the onrush of time closes up forthwith; it destroys the overtaking, the overlapping, the metamorphosis of time.
 - Socrates reminds us that it is not the same thing, but almost the opposite, to understand religion and to accept it.
 - The perceived world is the always-presupposed foundation of all rationality, all value, and all existence.
 - I live in the facial expressions of the other, as I feel him living in mine.
 - To ask for an explanation is to explain the obscure by the more obscure.
 - To understand is to experience harmony between what we aim at and what is given, between the intention and the performance – and the body is our anchorage in the world.
 - I discover vision, not as a ‘thinking about seeing,’ to use Descartes expression, but as a gaze at grips with a visible world, and that is why for me there can be another’s gaze.
 - Because we are in the world, we are condemned to meaning, and we cannot do or say anything without its acquiring a name in history.
