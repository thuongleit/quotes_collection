 - Having a Christian worldview means being utterly convinced that biblical principles are not only true but also work better in the grit and grime of the real world.
 - Redemption is as comprehensive as Creation and Fall. God does not save our souls while leaving our minds to function on their own. He redeems the whole person. Conversion is meant to give new direction to our thoughts, emotions, wills and habits.
 - Competition is always a good thing. It forces us to do our best. A monopoly renders people complacent and satisfied with mediocrity.

 - My aim in homeschooling is to give my children the ability to be an adult learner, a skill set that will last the rest of their lives.
 - In Gnosticism, the physical world did not ultimately matter – which meant physical suffering did not matter either. Seeking ‘enlightenment’ meant cultivating an attitude of detachment, even indifference.

 - Developing a Christian worldview means submitting our entire self to God, in an act of devotion and service to Him.
 - Christian adults need to think about talking to our own children as a form of cross-cultural missions. Cultural change happens so quickly that teens are exposed to ideas and worldviews very different from those of previous generations.
 - During the first 13 centuries after the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, no one thought of setting up a creche to celebrate Christmas. The pre-eminent Christian holiday was Easter, not Christmas.

 - The most consistent versions of materialism deny the reality of anything beyond matter – no soul, no spirit, no will, no mind. This is called reductionism: Humans are reduced to biochemical machines.
 - Christians must go beyond criticizing the degradation of American culture, roll up their sleeves, and get to work on positive solutions. The only way to drive out bad culture is with good culture.
 - There are unprecedented numbers of movements for human rights and freedoms. But the dominant worldviews in academia, like materialism and naturalism, deny the reality of freedom, reducing humans to robots. So where does the concept of human rights come from?
 - Literary theory has become a parody of science, generating its own arcane jargon. In the process, tragically, it discourages love of literature for its own sake.
 - Darwinism has become our culture’s official creation myth, protected by a priesthood as dogmatic as any religious curia.
 - When people commit themselves to a certain vision of reality, it becomes their ultimate explainer. It serves to interpret the universe for them, to guide their moral decisions, to give meaning and purpose to life, and all the other functions normally associated with a religion.
 - The word ‘tolerance’ once meant we all have the right to argue rationally for our deepest convictions in the public arena. Now it means those convictions are not even subject to rational debate.

 - To be intellectual does not require one to be alienated and oppositional.
 - All of science is largely formalized common sense.
 - We need to understand enough of modern thought to identify the ways it blocks us from living out the Gospel the way God intends, both in terms of intellectual roadblocks and in terms of economic and structural changes that make it harder to live by Scriptural principles.
 - The whole point of building theoretical systems is to explain what humans know by pre-theoretical experience. That is the starting point for any philosophy. That is the data it seeks to explain. If it fails to explain the data of experience, then it has failed the test. It has been falsified.
 - Mitchell claimed that her materialist view leads to “humbleness.” But it is not humbling; it is dehumanizing. It essentially reduces humans to robots.
 - A part is always too limited to explain the whole. You might picture a worldview as trying to stuff the entire universe into a box. Invariably, something will stick out of the box. Its categories are too “small” to explain the world.
 - We do not create marriage from scratch. Instead, in the elegant language of the marriage ceremony, we ’enter into the holy estate of matrimony.

 - When the only form of cultural commentary Christians offer is moral condemnation, no wonder we come across to non-believers as angry and scolding.
 - An idol is not necessarily something concrete, like a golden calf. It can also be something abstract, like matter. Is matter part of the created order? Sure it is. So the philosophy of materialism qualifies as an idol in the biblical sense.

 - You don’t have to be a Christian to recognize that materialism does not match reality. Materialism is not true to universal human experience – what we all know about ourselves.
 - Homeschoolers are the ultimate do-it-yourselfers. They are self-motivated and self-directed, independent-minded and creative. They are not content to turn their education of their children over to the government.
 - I discovered that Christianity does have the resources to meet the challenges posed by competing worldviews after all.
 - The human mind inherently seeks intelligible order. Thus the conviction that such an order exists to be found is a crucial assumption.
