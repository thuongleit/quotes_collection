 - Technique conquers all.
 - It’s not what you do, but HOW you do it. Because in the end everyone knows almost as much, just not the same way.
 - When you get a black belt, it’s not the number of techniques you know, but how well you know them.
 - Always work on the things you’re not good at, because once you develop skills in those areas, you have no more fears.
 - If you don’t care about losing, you will focus on technique.
