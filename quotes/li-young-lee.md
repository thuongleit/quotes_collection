 - People who read poetry have heard about the burning bush, but when you write poetry, you sit inside the burning bush.
 - Every time you write a poem it’s apocalyptic. You’re revealing who you really are to yourself.
 - Could it be in longing we are most ourselves?
 - The problem with memory is that is changes whatever it touches. It is never that accurate. As a result, I end up modifying and revising my own experiences. It’s myth making.
 - While all bodies share the same fate, all voices do not.
 - We suffer each other to have each other a while.
 - Memory is sweet. Even when it’s painful, memory is sweet.
 - A bruise, blue in the muscle, you impinge upon me. As bone hugs the ache home, so I’m vexed to love you, your body the shape of returns, your hair a torso of light, your heat I must have, your opening I’d eat, each moment of that soft-finned fruit, inverted fountain in which I don’t see me.

 - In writing poetry, all of one’s attention is focused on some inner voice.
 - A door jumps out from shadows, then jumps away. This is what I’ve come to find: the back door, unlatched. Tooled by insular wind, it slams and slams without meaning to and without meaning.
 - Brimming. That’s what it is, I want to get to a place where my sentences enact brimming.
 - Our bodies look solid, but they arent. Were like a fountain. A fountain of water looks solid, but you can put your fingers right through it. Our bodies look like things, but theres no thingness to them.
