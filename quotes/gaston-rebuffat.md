 - A la Verte on devient montagnard.
 - Climbing is, above all, a matter of integrity.
 - Rain is disagreeable, but snow is as much part of the mountain as are sunshine and clear skies.
 - Consider what you want to do in relation to what you are capable of doing. Climbing is, above all, a matter of integrity.
