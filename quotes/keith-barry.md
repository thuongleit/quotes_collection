 - By combining elements such as hypnosis, magic, neurolinguistic programming and psychology, I can make it appear that I can hack into people’s brains.
 - Studying neuro-linguistic programming is what teaches you how to implant and extract thoughts. Mixing psychology, hypnotism and magic somewhat goes into this area called mentalism, which is what I mostly do. It’s magic of the mind.
 - I don’t pretend that I can read minds. I don’t believe anybody can read minds. In other words, I don’t believe in psychics.
 - Some brains are easy to hack into, and other brains are nearly impossible to hack into because they are so complex.
 - Magic is all about directing attention. If I didn’t want you to look at my right hand then I don’t look at it.
 - I’m going to show you all how easy it is to manipulate the human mind once you know how.
 - I like pushing the envelope. I like pushing myself and the audience, whether it’s a TV show or live. I like to throw people over the edge of the cliff and scare the wits out of them, but then pull them back and make them safe.
 - TWINS by Nefesch is a fantastic piece of truly impromptu mentalism which will only be performed by fearless performers. Highly recommended!
