 - Those willing to die will live, and those willing to live will die.
 - A man needs a friend to share goals with, a woman to share his heart with, and a nation to serve with all of his heart. That’s the best life one can live.
 - I can be approached, but never pushed; befriended but never coerced; killed, but never shamed.
 - Don’t make a hasty movement. Be like a mountain. Move silently and cautiously.
 - The soldier who fights to death never dies, but the soldier who fights for existence never truly exists.
