 - A prison becomes a home when you have the key.
 - The cool, grey city of love.
 - What silence rules the ghostly hours That guard the close of human sleep!
 - Thy Banners gleam a little, and are furled; Against thy turrets surge His phantom towâ€™rs; Drugged with his Opiates the nations nod, Refusing still the beauty of thine hours; And fragile is thy tenure of this world Still haunted by the monstrous ghost of God.
 - Let him who is worthy by reason of his clear eye and unjaded heart wander across these borders of beauty and mystery and be glad.
