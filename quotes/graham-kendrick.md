 - My Lord, what love is this that pays so dearly. That I, the guilty one, may go free!
 - Worship is at heart a person offered to God, claiming no rights, making no more selfish demands than a dead man does, but living fully, richly and wholly to God and by His power.
 - He turns our weaknesses into His opportunities.
 - Worship is God’s enjoyment of us and our enjoyment of him.
 - To be converted to faith in Jesus Christ is to return to the worship of the true God, and to dethrone all rivals to his authority.
 - The genuiness of our worship cannot be measured in decibels of sound, and although it is vital that we express our love for God vocally, He looks to see the evidence in our lives.
 - Worship has been misunderstood as something that arises from a feeling which “comes upon you,” but it is vital that we understand that it is rooted in a conscious act of the will, to serve and obey the Lord Jesus Christ.
