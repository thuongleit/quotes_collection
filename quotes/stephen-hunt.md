 - If you’re not living on the edge you’re taking up too much space.
 - Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
 - Not many people like him, he’s an angry man. He’d go after his own shadow.
 - All I have left is my anger at the foolishness of the world. The unnecessary cruelties, the pomposity and vanity of people who should know better. Most of the time I just want to shake some sense into the world.
