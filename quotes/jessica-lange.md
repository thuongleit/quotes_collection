 - I never shot on sets, but if I was traveling somewhere or on location, I would always have my camera, and I’d always be – it’s that kind of fly on the wall approach to photography, though. I don’t engage the subject. I like to sneak around, skulk about in the dark.
 - As an actor, you have to have trust and believe that somebody is taking care of you or watching your back. With a part like this, especially with where we’re going with it, I can’t pull any punches. I can’t do it halfway, especially when you’re dealing with madness and this descent into madness.
 - There was a period of time when I was very political, when I was at the university. It was like the late ’60s, early ’70s and I was a dissident like everybody else I guess. Now I follow it but there’s nothing that really grabs me. The most fascinating thing to me right now is China.
