 - I don’t want to live in the kind of world where we don’t look out for each other. Not just the people that are close to us, but anybody who needs a helping hand. I cant change the way anybody else thinks, or what they choose to do, but I can do my bit.
 - Don’t forget – no one else sees the world the way you do, so no one else can tell the stories that you have to tell.
 - Every time you do a good deed you shine the light a little farther into the dark. And the thing is, when you’re gone that light is going to keep shining on, pushing the shadows back.
 - Look inside yourself for the answers – you’re the only one who knows what’s best for you. Everybody else is only guessing.
 - You’ve got to find yourself first. Everything else’ll follow.
 - Our lives are stories, and the stories we have to give to each other are the most important. No one has a story too small and all are of equal stature. We each tell them in different ways, through different mediums – and if we care about each other, we’ll take the time to listen.
 - We’re all made of stories. When they finally put us underground, the stories are what will go on. Not forever, perhaps, but for a time. It’s a kind of immortality, I suppose, bounded by limits, it’s true, but then so’s everything.
 - I do believe in an everyday sort of magic – the inexplicable connectedness we sometimes experience with places, people, works of art and the like; the eerie appropriateness of moments of synchronicity; the whispered voice, the hidden presence, when we think we’re alone.
 - But that’s what we all are-just stories. We only exist by how people remember us, by the stories we make of our lives. Without the stories, we’d just fade away.
 - It’s easy to believe in magic when you’re young. Anything you couldn’t explain was magic then. It didn’t matter if it was science or a fairy tale. Electricity and elves were both infinitely mysterious and equally possible – elves probably more so.
 - When all’s said and done, all roads lead to the same end. So it’s not so much which road you take, as how you take it.
 - I want to be magic. I want to touch the heart of the world and make it smile. I want to be a friend of elves and live in a tree. Or under a hill. I want to marry a moonbeam and hear the stars sing. I don’t want to pretend at magic anymore. I want to be magic.
 - I was going through the motions of life, instead of really living, and there’s no excuse for that. It’s not something I’ll let happen to me again.
 - Life is like art. You have to work hard to keep it simple and still have meaning.
 - You can’t stand up to the night until you understand what’s hiding in its shadows.
 - It’s all a matter of paying attention, being awake in the present moment, and not expecting a huge payoff. The magic in this world seems to work in whispers and small kindnesses.
 - The real problem is, people think life is a ladder, and it’s really a wheel.
 - Wisdom never comes to those who believe they have nothing left to learn.
 - That’s the thing about magic; you’ve got to know it’s still here, all around us, or it just stays invisible for you.
 - Every time we fix something that broken, whether it’s a car engine or a broken heart, that an act of magic. And what makes it magic is that we choose to create or help, just as we can choose to harm.
 - It’s the questions we ask, the journey we take to get to where we are going that is more important than the actual answer.
 - The stronger a woman gets, the more insecure the men in her life feel. It doesn’t work that way for a woman. We celebrate strength – in our partners as well as in ourselves.
 - There’s bad apples in whatever way you want to group people – doesn’t matter if it’s religious, political or social. The big mistake is generalizing.
 - Books and music saved me as a teenager because it was through them that I realized that I wasn’t alone in my obsessive love for words and music.
 - If you’re not ready to die, then how can you live?
 - We’re so quick to cut away pieces of ourselves to suit a particular relationship, a job, a circle of friends, incessantly editing who we are until we fit in.
 - Like legend and myth, magic fades when it is unused – hence all the old tales of elfin kingdoms moving further and further away from our world, or that magical beings require our faith, our belief in their existence, to survive. That is a lie. All they require is our recognition.
 - Remember the quiet wonders. The world has more need of them than it has for warriors.
 - I hate the thought of her being forced into a box that doesn’t fit her. Of having her wings cut off, her sight blinded, her hearing muted, her voice stilled.
 - It’s all those stories and how they braid together that tells us who and what and where we are.
 - One expected growth, change; without it, the world was less, the well of inspiration dried up, the muses fled.
 - I don’t actually talk about my books much, because I find if I talk about them I don’t want to write them anymore. I write to find out what happens. You know how you read a book? That’s what I’m doing except I’m just doing it a lot slower because it takes a lot longer to do.
 - Let it go on record that any confusion arose simply because we lacked certain commonalities of reference.
 - We’re all made of stories. When they finally put us underground, the stories are what will go on.
 - I wouldn’t like to live in a world where everything’s as cut-and-dried as most people think it is.
 - You wouldn’t want any creative process to lose its sense of fun and adventure, but that doesn’t mean you can’t take it seriously as well.
 - The fey wonders of the world only exist while there are those with the sight to see them.
 - Not everything has to mean something. Some things just are.
 - In the dark attics of our minds, all times mingle.
 - Without mysteries, life would be very dull indeed. What would be left to strive for if everything were known?
 - It is so easy for your people to forget that everything has a spirit, that all are equal. That magic and mystery are a part of your lives, not something to store away in a child’s bedroom, or to use as an escape from your lives.
 - The family we choose for ourselves is more important than the one we were born into; that people have to earn our respect and trust, not have it handed to them simply because of genetics.
 - You don’t have to be Michelangelo to teach basic art, just as you don’t have to be Shakespeare to be able to teach the correct use of language.
 - I don’t know what’s waiting for us when we die – something better, something worse. I only know I’m not ready to find out yet.
 - Everybody’s got the potential for great good and great wrong in them, but it’s the choices we make that define who we really are.
 - There is no plan, no future laid out for any of us beyond what we make for ourselves.
 - A name can’t begin to encompass the sum of all her parts. But that’s the magic of names, isn’t it? That the complex, contradictory individuals we are can be called up complete and whole in another mind through the simple sorcery of a name.
 - You can take the woman outta the trash, but you can’t take the trash out a the woman.
 - Only fools think they’re wise; the rest of us just muddle through as we can.
 - Magic lies in between things, between the day and the night, between yellow and blue, between any two things.
 - There’s never an easy route to the things that matter.
 - Magic’s never what you expect it to be, but it’s often what you need.
 - I can’t imagine it now, but I must’ve been innocent at some time in my life. A baby don’t just get itself born bad, do it?
 - We end up stumbling our way through the forest, never seeing all the unexpected and wonderful possibilities and potentials because we’re looking for the idea of a tree, instead of appreciating the actual trees in front of us.
 - The magic in this world seems to work in whispers and small kindnesses.
 - What I want to do is travel deep and deeper into the dreamlands, to find that place that I know is waiting for me here. My home.
 - The past scampers like an alley cat through the present, leaving the paw prints of memories scattered helter-skelter.
 - Children are the brightest treasures we bring forth into this world, but too large a percentage of the population continues to treat them as inconveniences and nuisances, when they’re not treating them as possessions or toys.
 - Fortune-telling doesn’t reveal the future; it mirrors the present. It resonates against what your subconscious already knows and hauls it up out of the darkness so you can get a good look at it.
 - Let me give you some advice: Try to approach things without preconceived ideas, without supposing you already know everything there is to know about them. Get that trick down and you’ll be surprised at what’s really all around you.
 - There are as many stories to be told as there are people to tell them about; only the mean-spirited would consider there to be a competition at all.
 - It’s not all about getting your own way. Sometimes there’s a bigger picture.
 - Often the magical elements in my books are standing in for elements of the real world, the small and magical-in-their-own-right sorts of things that we take for granted and no longer pay attention to, like the bonds of friendship that entwine our own lives with those of other people and places.
 - Witchery is merely a word for what we are all capable of – heightened nightsight, an empathy shared with the beasts, a utilization of the more obscure abilities of our minds. Nothing that science can’t explain away. Wizardry is spells and enchantments. Fairy tales.
 - If you don’t believe that the world has a heart, then you won’t hear it beating, you won’t think it’s alive and you won’t consider what you’re doing to it.
 - We call them faerie. We don’t believe in them. Our loss.
 - There’s stories and then there’s stories. The ones with any worth change your life forever, perhaps only in a small way, but once you’ve heard them, they are forever a part of you. You nurture them and pass them on, and the giving only makes you feel better. The others are just words on a page.
 - The beginning of a friendship, the fact that two people out of the thousands around them can meet and connect and become friends, seems like a kind of magic to me. But maintaining a friendship requires work. I don’t mean that as a bad thing. Good art requires work as well.

 - How hard would it be to ask children what they see in their heads? How big should the house be in comparison to the family standing in front of it? What is it about the anatomy of the people that doesn’t look right? Then let them try it again. Teach them to learn how to see and ask questions.
 - I like living in the city where I have all my books and music and can go out to buy that night’s dinner or easily see a band. But I also like the wild places, especially hiking in the desert and the Eastern woodlands. Do I have to choose?
 - The thing with pretending you’re in a good mood is that sometimes you can.
 - Inside us lies every possibility that is available to a sentient being. Every darkness, every light. It is the choices we make that decide who or what we will be.

 - I don’t think the world works on merit.

 - Everything is the way it is because we’ve all agreed that’s the way it is.

 - It’s not the work or the personality of the founder of a religion that’s important, but what its followers do with what they learn.
