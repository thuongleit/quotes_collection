 - You’re only human. You live once and life is wonderful, so eat the damned red velvet cupcake.
 - I can’t think of any better representation of beauty than someone who is unafraid to be herself.
 - If you knew everyone’s story, you would love them. You can’t really hate anyone if you know everything that happened to them between their birth and now; why they became the way they became; why they have walls up or down. If you truly know someone, you’d get it.
 - I know that when you’re a teenager – sometimes when you’re an adult – what sets you apart can sometimes feel like a burden and it’s not. A lot of the time, it’s what makes you great.
 - My absolute favorite kind of people in the world are people that are passionate about something.
 - What sets you apart can feel like a burden, but it’s not.

 - Anyone who’s making a huge impact or speaking out about what they believe in or who’s brave enough to be themselves is a superhero to me.

 - If I feel strongly about anything, I get overwhelmed with emotion.
 - The idea that you can’t be attractive and funny at the same time is something that I hate.
 - As an actor, you have to just think about the truth of your character. You have to think about how to play the character in the way that you know it needs to be played in your heart and why you were hired.
 - Not to be confused with Spider-Man’s other girlfriend Mary Jane Watson, who is a skank and doesn’t love him like I do.
 - I don’t believe that everyone else really cares what I do all the time. I think in general you have to follow your own path and your own heart and not worry about what everybody else wants you to do. They should be worried about what they’re going to do.
 - I’m just trying to keep my head above water as I learn how to act. I feel like I have so much to learn, it’s insane. The only thing I know is that I don’t know or have a grasp on anything other than this one thing that’s within me, whatever that is, so I’m just trying to trust that.
 - We’re always too skinny, or too fat. Too tall, or too short. We’re shaming each other, and we’re shaming ourselves, and it sucks.

 - You know how sports teach kids teamwork and how to be strong and brave and confident? Improv was my sport. I learned how to not waffle and how to hold a conversation, how to take risks and actually be excited to fail.
 - I try not to look at stories on the Internet because I don’t want to psych myself out. I kinda half to stay off the Internet. I’m not thick-skinned enough. I get too sensitive. I don’t want it to effect what I’m doing.
 - I had massive anxiety as a child. I was in therapy. From 8 to 10, I was borderline agora-phobic. I could not leave my mom’s side. There was a lot of fear, but it was also very exciting.
 - On the first day of middle school I wore high-heeled shoes that you weren’t allowed to wear. I remember being so embarrassed because in every class I went to they kept pointing out that I couldn’t wear these shoes. I wanted to call my mom and have her bring me new shoes!

 - I’ve got a great family and great people around me that would be able to kick me in the shins if I ever for one minute got lost up in the clouds. I’ve been really lucky in that sense.
 - I can’t help moving my face – reacting – when I watch a movie, because I’m really inhabiting a character. I know this is weird, but it demonstrates what I love about cinema: it allows you to live a different life, to have a different experience, to disappear for two hours. I think it’s wonderful.
 - There’s this Ryan Gosling quote that I steal all the time – I watched an interview with him in Cannes – and he said picking roles is like listening to songs on the radio: There can be a lot of really great songs in a row, but then one comes on that just makes you want to dance.
 - I’m not there to be the token sexy girl. I don’t know that I would ever be able to pull that off. It’s nice that those characters I’ve played feel uncomfortable as well because it’s so much more realistic.
 - Sometimes I definitely shut people out. I can be that sort of girlfriend who crosses her arms, shakes her head and says, “Nope, I’m not telling you what’s wrong. I’m fine.”

 - Sometimes you’re not like the person you’d want to hang out with. Would I really want to hang out with me full time? No, you’ve gotta find people who balance you out.

 - You won’t hear me saying I have no body issues because I wouldn’t be human if I didn’t.
 - I like to look like a person. It drives me crazy when you see women in movies playing teachers, and they have biceps. It totally takes me out of the movie. I start thinking, Wow, that actress playing this part really looks great!
 - I’ve been looking at that in myself lately. Often, joking for me is a way of diffusing the awkwardness of a situation, so it’s kind of exhilarating to be a part of projects where there’s nothing funny or lighthearted.
 - I have dreams of being a producer, being behind a camera, eating seven tacos for every meal, and making movies that affect people the way they affect me. I don’t even need to be in them.

 - I think there are plenty of soulmates out there. That’s what I choose to believe.
 - My parents always put more of an emphasis on who I was as opposed to what I achieved. They were never like, “You won that! You did this!” It was all about, “You’ve got a good heart. You’re a good friend. You’re a good daughter.” So that other stuff in no way defines my sense of self.
 - I’m just learning every day and I hope to continue that until the day I die. I’m just trying to learn and experience as much as I possibly can. I look at acting, at how I look at being involved in a job and living my life and prioritising.

 - I used to do Facebook but you get a little too wrapped up in that stuff. Its more distracting than anything so I don’t any more. I left it behind. I detoxed!

 - When I did TV, I only did little guest parts, and it hasn’t been that long. There is a kind of pressure in this job that comes from your work every day being there forever. But this is all part of the brand-new world that I’m discovering.
