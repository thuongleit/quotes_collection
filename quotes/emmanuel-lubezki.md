 - I see an incredible abuse of close-ups in many films these days. Why is that?
 - The language of film is further and further away from the language of theater, and is closer to music. It’s abstract but still narrative. Everything feels less rehearsed. It’s more experimental than classical.
 - Every time you start a movie is to explore with a director and if you can with the actors and with the other collaborators and try to figure out what’s the best way to tell the specific story.
 - If I’m collaborating with an artist I like to give them my point of view and if they don’t want to take any of my recommendations it’s fine, but it’s hard otherwise.
