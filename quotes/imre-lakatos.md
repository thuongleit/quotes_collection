 - Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind.
 - There is no falsification before the emergence of a better theory.
 - It is not that we propose a theory and Nature may shout NO; rather, we propose a maze of theories, and Nature may shout INCONSISTENT.
 - Blind commitment to a theory is not an intellectual virtue: it is an intellectual crime.
 - Man’s respect for knowledge is one of his most peculiar characteristics. Knowledge in Latin is scientia, and science came to be the name of the most respectable kind of knowledge.
 - The classical example of a successful research programme is Newton’s gravitational theory: possibly the most successful research programme ever.
 - Einstein’s results again turned the tables and now very few philosophers or scientists still think that scientific knowledge is, or can be, proven knowledge.
 - Intellectual honesty consists in stating the precise conditions under which one will give up one’s belief.
 - Research programmes, besides their negative heuristic, are also characterized by their positive heuristic.
 - Mathematics does not grow through a monotonous increase of the number of indubitably established theorems but through the incessant improvement of guesses by speculation and criticism, by the logic of proofs and refutations.
 - In degenerating programmes, however, theories are fabricated only in order to accommodate known facts.
 - The proving power of the intellect or the senses was questioned by the skeptics more than two thousand years ago; but they were browbeaten into confusion by the glory of Newtonian physics.
 - The positive heuristic of the programme saves the scientist from becoming confused by the ocean of anomalies.
 - No experimental result can ever kill a theory: any theory can be saved from counterinstances either by some auxiliary hypothesis or by a suitable reinterpretation of its terms.
 - It would be wrong to assume that one must stay with a research programme until it has exhausted all its heuristic power, that one must not introduce a rival programme before everybody agrees that the point of degeneration has probably been reached.
 - If even in science there is no a way of judging a theory but by assessing the number, faith and vocal energy of its supporters, then this must be even more so in the social sciences: truth lies in power.
 - Belief may be a regrettably unavoidable biological weakness to be kept under the control of criticism: but commitment is for Popper an outright crime.
 - Indeed, this epistemological theory of the relation between theory and experiment differs sharply from the epistemological theory of naive falsificationism.
