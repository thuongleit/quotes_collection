 - If you think it’s simple, then you have misunderstood the problem.
 - The first law of computer science: Every problem is solved by yet another indirection.
 - The most important single aspect of software development is to be clear about what you are trying to build.
 - Design and programming are human activities; forget that and all is lost.
 - When done well, software is invisible.
 - Java isn’t platform independent; it is a platform.
 - The most fundamental problem in software development is complexity. There is only one basic way of dealing with complexity: divide and conquer.
 - Proof by analogy is fraud.
 - Nobody should call themselves a professional if they only knew one language.
 - A program that has not been tested does not work.
 - Our civilization depends critically on software, and we have a dangerously low degree of professionalism in the computer fields.
 - It is my firm belief that all successful languages are grown and not merely designed from first principles.
 - The standard library saves programmers from having to reinvent the wheel.
 - However, when Java is promoted as the sole programming language, its flaws and limitations become serious.
 - Most of the programmers in ten years will be us, and we won’t get much smarter.
 - Anybody who comes to you and says he has a perfect language is either naive or a salesman.
 - Certainly not every good program is object-oriented, and not every object-oriented program is good.
 - Defining OO as based on the use of class hierarchies and virtual functions is also practical in that it provides some guidance as to where OO is likely to be successful.
 - Any verbose and tedious solution is error-prone because programmers get bored.
 - It’s easy to win forgiveness for being wrong; being right is what gets you into real trouble.
 - Too many managers and executives try to reduce programming to a low-level assembly-line activity. That’s inefficient, wasteful, costly in the long run, and inhumane to programmers.
 - There’s an old story about the person who wished his computer were as easy to use as his telephone. That wish has come true, since I no longer know how to use my telephone.
 - Always think about how a piece of code should be used: good interfaces are the essence of good code. You can hide all kinds of clever and dirty code behind a good interface if you really need such code.
 - I would encourage nonproprietary standards for tools and libraries.
 - I like doing research that has an impact. If I went to a company to make what they call ‘real money,’ I’d be just trying to make a system work as fast as possible to meet the product and serice deadlines.
 - An organization that treats its programmers as morons will soon have programmers that are willing and able to act like morons only.
 - To many managers, getting rid of the arrogant, undisciplined, over-paid, technology-obsessed, improperly-dressed etc. programmers would appear to be a significant added benefit.
 - Some software is actually pretty good, by any standard. Think of the Mars Rovers, Google, and the Human Genome Project. Now, that’s quality software!
 - Clearly, I reject the view that there is one way that is right for everyone and for every problem.
 - There are more useful systems developed in languages deemed awful than in languages praised for being beautiful – many more.
 - I find languages that support just one programming paradigm constraining.
 - I do not think that safety should be bought at the cost of complicating the expression of good solutions to real-life problems.
 - It is easy to study the rules of overloading and of templates without noticing that together they are one of the keys to elegant and efficient type-safe containers.
 - People who passionately want to believe that the world is basically simple react to this with a fury that goes beyond what I consider appropriate for discussing a programming language.
 - Destructors for virtual base classes are executed in the reverse order of their appearance in a depth-first left-to-right traversal of the directed acyclic graph of base classes.
 - I assume that a sufficiently skilled will be able to do anything not explicitly forbidden by the hardware.
