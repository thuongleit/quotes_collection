 - All girls over age 14 remove pubic hair. The only touching is to remove hair. That’s grim.
 - Effectively, it makes the greasepaint permanent, blurring the lines not only between public and private but also between the authentic and contrived self. If all the world was once a stage, it has now become a reality TV show: we mere players are not just aware of the camera; we mug for it.
 - Sexualization is the performance of sexuality, the performance of sexiness. Girls are super good at that now.
 - Girls are removing pubic hair before fully having it. They would say I feel cleaner, it’s for me, but then they’d say if a boy saw pubic hair down there they’d head for the hills.
