 - There is nothing to fear except the power you give to your own demons.
 - You see, the what ifs are as boundless as the stars.
 - Honestly, I had no idea that the heart could cause such trouble and strife. It could be broken and still mend. It could be wounded and still heal. It could be given away still returned, lost and found. It could do all that and still you lived, though according to some, only just.
 - It had struck me that the world was full of holes, holes which you could fall into, never to be seen again. I couldnâ€™t understand the difference between disappearance and death. Both seemed the same to me, both left holes. Holes in your heart holes in your life.
