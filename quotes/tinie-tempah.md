 - I’m merely a fan of fashion from high end to streetwear, from Nike to Comme des Garcons.
 - People used to say poems were different to songs but I don’t think they are.

 - My goal, my aim is to be a superstar, but not in a cheesy way. I want to go to America and do what they do. But better!
 - I was well brought up, my parents are still together. I lived in a council estate, but I don’t anymore; I saw my parents buy a nice house and move me to a nice area.
 - If I go to an awards ceremony, I wear a suit, of course I do. I am proud to be there. If there are young kids looking at pictures of me, I want them to feel that they should long for the opportunity to go somewhere really smart and wear a beautiful suit, rather than to reject that.
 - I can wear a suit, sweatpants, a long tee shirt, and a denim jacket all at the same time.
 - I think it’s imperative to have faith or religion, because it’s good to have morals, to be kind to others.

 - I’m a big fan of Paco Rabanne’s 1 Million.
 - I’m so down to earth, I’m bringing gravity back.
 - I’m really big on family. I’ll love catching up with my cousins. Everyone’s in their twenties, so they’re all on their grind at the moment, but when we get the time, I’ll fly everybody to Amsterdam or Ibiza, and we can just hang for a week, chill, do nothing.
 - This is the kind of fashion I grew up on – a good pair of trainers, great denim – and I will always love high-end streetwear.
 - If people are not listening to you as individuals, it’s always good to get together and make a stand for something.
 - I’m a bit of a mummy’s boy.
 - I’ve definitely done something that’s made my mum and dad forever proud.

Even my principal – I sold out the O2 Arena in London, and he came out to see me, which was really cool. I actually put a picture with him on my Instagram, and I think and he’s wearing one of my snapbacks.
 - Hopefully, young people will see that you can be young and make the sacrifices to follow your dreams.

 - As a young guy from south London, I wanted to be able to make myself stand out.
 - At the end of the day, I’m a human being and I just think that’s what it is. Challenging stereotypes by just being who I am.
 - I don’t think I’ve had to change anything, really, apart from being more serious and focussed on my drive. One thing I’ve realised is that you get out what you put in and because of that my work rate has increased ten fold.
 - I feel like I’m indirectly showing people, not that there’s another way, but just that if you really have a dream, you should try and give it a go.
 - You have to do a show, an interview, you’ve got to go straight back on the road to another location, make a track and edit things like footage etc. It’s non stop. I really respect the hustle and work rate of Chipmunk, as well as N-Dubz and Tinchy Stryder.
 - I’ve seen how much effort has to go into a tour, the performance and also how to look after yourself, not just physically, but mentally too.
 - Being able to travel the world is pretty cool. There are places that I’ve always wanted to go to but being able to go there as somebody who’s a musician and is recognised as one is cool.
 - I don’t want to achieve less than my mum and dad.
 - Maybe when it comes to my music, or my performances, I’m a little more aggressive because I want everything to be perfect. But not in normal, day-to-day life.

 - I definitely believe in God.
 - Gone are the days when you’d have to tune in to a mad illegal radio station late at night to be able to hear the rapper of your choice. That’s all changed now. That’s all gone out of the window. And I feel like I represent that change. I represent the era of iPods and Shuffle and things like that.
 - The way everyone in London is right up against each other makes it very real to you growing up, the fact that people have different lives to you. And that causes problems; of course it does.
 - I was like 14 and decided I wanted to be a rapper, so I needed a hip rapper name. I was with one of my friends in class and literally went through a thesaurus. I saw “temper” and thought, “I like this, but it’s too much.” My friend was like, “What about Tinie for tiny,” and that was that.
 - I watched my parents go from having very basic jobs to educating themselves, to buying a house. They set a really good bar for what they wanted their kids to achieve.
 - I’m into everything. My iPod is very eclectic – if you kept it on shuffle, you’d be amazed. For example, I was forced to grow up on Dolly Parton. My mum was obsessed by her. She bought all this memorabilia for the front room. It’s ridiculous.

 - I first became interested in style when I was 16 and I had my first couple of gigs. I realised I couldn’t look like the people I was performing to. Not in a condescending way, but just that it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing.
 - I like to think I don’t make music for ignorant people.
 - Nigeria is like everywhere, really: there are some beautiful places that have been invested in and others that haven’t been.
 - I grew up in an eclectic house where people were listening to all types of different music. I also think being educated, eloquent and knowing how to talk for yourself in the industry makes you go a long way.
 - I work with a trainer called Ruben Tabares. He’s a nutritionist, strength and conditioning coach, and an athlete. So I literally just train like an athlete.

 - I’m actually going to the gym, working on getting not fatter, just a bit bulkier.
 - I’m quite a fan of British designers.
 - There’s this other girl called Lykke Li from Sweden – I really want to collaborate with her, that’d be great. Obviously Kanye West as well, and Drake would be pretty amazing.
 - When I got a little older I was obsessed Lil Wayne. But then it was just as many British rappers – Dizzee Rascal I would always listen to.

 - Sometimes I would bring some of my music to the school and perform on the playground, and they’d think, “There goes Patrick, trying to entertain everyone as usual.”

 - A lot of young people have all these aspirations but many of them don’t believe they’re possible.
 - When I was about 14 I remember thinking when it came to proposing to my future girlfriend, I’d make a CD with all her favourite songs and a message that said, ‘Will you marry me?’ Shows you what a romantic I was. No one listens to CDs any more. It’s all about iTunes.
