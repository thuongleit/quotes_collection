 - The gloves are like a second skin. They are part of me. An extension of me. I become hyperreal.
 - I get so fed up with the making of an album taking over my life – it’s all I can think about or talk about. You find yourself in a rut and lacking inspiration and it’s hard to get out of that because I’m working alone in the studio.
 - Some people think electronic music is cold, but I think that has more to do with the people listening than the actual music itself.
 - I took my life in my hands and social media has just helped me do that more.
 - I just love crafting and shaping sounds. Actually, many of the sounds that I work with start off as organic instruments – guitar, piano, clarinet, etc. But I do love the rigidity of electronic drums.
 - I’m never gonna go into a studio and work for a whole year non-stop. Just every day on my own in the studio working, it’s just too damn hard.
 - It’s been so amazing. I’ve always struggled with this barrier that I felt like I’d had up until blogging came along. Just one comment from somebody really sparks something in me. It doesn’t need to be this huge war between me and the listeners anymore. I really thrive on that.
 - I never had any social life, just played the piano and studied, studied, studied.
 - My grand plan is that I can master having a better life by making sure I have a regular flow of songs. Then I can give myself time to tour or celebrate or write a film score.
 - Once I actually get in the studio and I start working, I’m fine, but it’s just getting there and these hours of torment with myself and self doubt, thinking ‘I’m useless’ and ‘Who am I, conning myself into thinking I can do it again.’
 - Everything stems from real experiences but I do also have a very vivid imagination. A song lyric gets easily carried away with itself and can end up somewhere I’d never have predicted.
