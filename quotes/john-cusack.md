 - Sometimes you meet people and you feel like you’ve known them for a long time.
 - There are some good people. But a good chunk of them will lie for no reason at all – it’ll be ten o’clock and they’ll tell you it’s nine. You’re looking at the clock and you can’t even fathom why they’re lying. They just lie because that’s what they do.
 - If you’re looking at things with the right set of eyes, people are endlessly fascinating. And then, of course, if you look at it the wrong way, then the whole world is horrible and tedious and boring. That’s the battle, really – to keep looking at the world in the right way.
 - If you’re going to get into social criticism with absurdity and satire, you can’t be politically correct when you do that.
 - The elderly have so much to offer. They’re our link with history.
 - You can only really judge yourself in comparison to other people. How bad you are, but you’re not as bad as someone else. So it’s degrees of losing.
 - I always liked it when people go back in time to discover things about themselves, like with ‘A Christmas Carol’ and you’re getting a tour of your life by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.
 - I think that taking night trains or meeting someone on the road is pretty romantic. I’ve done a couple of things like that. I’ve surprised someone in Paris. And hopefully, when you surprise someone, they’re happy to see you.
 - I’m a paranoid schizophrenic. I am my own entourage!
 - I force people to have coffee with me, just because I don’t trust that a friendship can be maintained without any other senses besides a computer or cellphone screen.
 - Texas women have an amazing sense of purpose when they lose it. They’re the best girls in the world – they’re loyal and fun, but when they get mad, they’ll try to kill you.

 - The minute you realize that your options are unlimited, things just start falling into place all around you.

 - If you’re a movie star, there’s a cycle you go through: adoration, adulation, you’re used, and then you’re discarded. And it happens again and again, always in that sequence.
 - It’s something we, guys, have all done. Made tapes for girls, trying to impress them, to meet them on a shared plane of aesthetics. Read them someone else’s poetry because they do poetry better than you could do it, because you’re too awkward to do it.
 - I think any actor can probably identify with being a professional liar. You don’t always look at yourself that way, but I know a lot of days I do.
 - I don’t agonize over decisions as much these days. The criteria of what’s important to me is clear.
 - You just try to get the best jobs that you can get. Sometimes I produce my own movies, so that’s your own sort of vision. That helps things. I don’t know what it is. Probably just circumstance. I’ve definitely been aware of the fact that I want to do different things.
 - With acting, you wanna see if you can get into trouble without knowing how you’re gonna get out of it. It’s like the exact opposite of war, where you need an exit strategy. When you’re acting, you should get all the way into trouble with no exit strategy, and have the cameras rolling.
 - It’s like those high-school yearbook photos that everyone would rather not see: Oh my God, look at that mullet hair. I have those photos too, but for me, they’re, like, entire movies. And they show them on cable.
 - I grew up in Evanston and lived in Chicago for a long time, in Old Town and Wrigleyville. I did three films when I was in high school. The first was ‘Class,’ with Rob Lowe. I had a supporting role in that.
 - People try to keep their past, like kind of holding on to their past. Every Springsteen song talks about that.
 - I have a bit of a rebellious nature.
 - Well, acting itself is a form of rebellion, always. Getting up there in front of people, telling stories – you’re kind of going against the grain to begin with, wanting to do that, don’t you think? Why else would you do it? Except maybe as kind of a way to affirm your very existence.
 - The more you expose yourself as a celebrity, the less interesting you are to watch in your work, because if you’re putting yourself out there all the time, you’re not holding anything back.
 - Any time you stop looking at evil as a black and white thing, it’s helpful. So the fact that there won’t be any obligatory Islamic terrorist stereotypes in movies any more, that’d be helpful.
 - Usually I do everything reverse. I practice something in movies and then I try it in real life.
 - It’s supposed to feel good to throw a brick at the right people. There is a long tradition of naming and ridiculing and shaming and calling the villains what they are. Usually it was the artistocracy of the day and satire was the only way to speak truth to power.
 - I was raised Irish Catholic, but I don’t consider myself Irish Catholic: I consider myself me, an American.

 - I think poets tell better history than historians. Historians lie all the time but the poets can get to truth of it.
 - I think everything has some politics to it. It’s just whether or not it admits to it. Politics is weird. I don’t even know what that means any more.
 - All my romantic stories are a scrambled version of that first one.
 - Death is a billion-dollar business. They can’t even pass a law where it takes seven days to get a gun. Why don’t you have to go through the same kind of screening you do to get a driver’s license? It’s totally insane.
 - It never hurts to be involved in any political or activist organization. I can never see how participation would be a bad thing. The key is being true to what you participate with and who.
 - I think that Poe is so resonant because he represents that part of us that is in misery or sorrowful or wants to explore the darkness. He wrote a great story called ‘The Imp of the Perverse’ about the instinct towards self-destruction. Poe is the godfather of Goth literature and that whole movement.
 - Hitler was so modern, in that he was obsessed with being famous. He was caught up with this rush to be have achieved greatness before turning 30.

 - Most movies, once the action starts there’s no more characters. You say a couple of dumb lines and then there’s just explosions until the end.

 - When applied to politics and taken to its extreme, kitsch is the mask of death. Fascism was all aesthetics. There was no core principle to it. There was no truth to it.
 - There’s also some element of coming of age during the Reagan administration, which everybody has painted as some glorious time in America, but I remember as being a very, very dark time. There was apocalypse in the air; the punk rock movement made sense.
 - Acting can be pretty challenging. I can’t say making a romantic comedy is challenging, but to do anything well, you have to put yourself into it.

 - I remember once acting really cool on a bus with this girl named Stephanie. When I got home, I realized that I had a really big zit on my forehead. If you have acne problems, you really shouldn’t be acting like Don Juan.
 - I don’t walk around talking about my life and spouting my philosophy to people I don’t know. I mean, if I get to know them, I’ll talk for hours. I guess I like a lower-key scene.

 - It’s a very frightening time when something as basic as due process is seen as somehow radical.
 - Probably Lloyd in ‘Say Anything’ is the closest to me – or to who I was at the time. It was just a great love story about people in the ’80s, and we all tried to make it feel as real as possible. It was such a wonderful time. We didn’t leave anything in the gym; we put it all out there.

 - My job is to just express something that I want to express. And if I’m ahead or behind the curve, that’s for others to decide.
 - I don’t agonize over decisions as much these days. The criteria of what’s important to me is clear. The insecurity that you feel, and the paranoia that you feel, have been around for a long time – you know it’s a liar because it’s been lying to you all along – every time you start something new.
 - I try not to dwell on the past. I’m not a big go-back-and-try-to-relive-your-past kinda person.
 - Getting trapped back in the ’80s, it’s almost like a comic nightmare, which for me is a very real nightmare. Every time I flip through the cable, I have flashbacks.
 - If I’m in something that I think is kinda good, it stays with me like a fever dream for a long time afterwards. I don’t recall the finished product so much as the feeling of making it.

 - I’m definitely nostalgic about the music of my youth; The Clash and Fishbone and that whole music scene. I still have all that music to this day. There was some great music going on in the late 70s and 80s.
 - The ages two to 15 I spent at different stages of shortness. I didn’t become a tall person until I was 16.
