 - The plural of anecdote is not data.
 - Humans are a part of nature, not apart from nature.
 - Animals are not property or “things” but rather living organisms, subjects of a life, who are worthy of our compassion, respect, friendship, and support.
 - Often, the greater our ignorance about something, the greater our resistance to change.

 - It’s bad biology to rob nonhuman animals of their emotional lives.
 - Let us remember that animals are not mere resources for human consumption. They are splendid beings in their own right, who have evolved alongside us as co-inheritors of all the beauty and abundance of life on this planet.
 - All animals, including humans, have a right to lives of dignity and respect, without forced intrusions.

 - I would like to believe that it is, and will continue to be, human compassion for other beings that will result in our giving them the protection they deserve, because of who they are, not because of what they can do for us or because some law tells us what we have to do.
 - Some people say they love animals and yet harm them nonetheless; I’m glad those people don’t love me.
