 - Try to make at least one person happy every day. If you cannot do a kind deed, speak a kind word. If you cannot speak a kind word, think a kind thought. Count up, if you can, the treasure of happiness that you would dispense in a week, in a year, in a lifetime!
 - If you want to make friends, go out of your way to do things for other people – things that require time, energy, unselfishness, and thoughtfulness.

 - If you feel an aversion to a person – that is, an unexplainable feeling of dislike or distaste for him – it is the most dangerous time for a proper opinion of him, his character, or his actions. Any judgment you pass upon him at such a time is bound to be unfair.

 - Only a kind person is able to judge another justly and to make allowances for his weaknesses. A kind eye, while recognizing defects, sees beyond them.
