 - I’d rather feel pain than nothing at all.
 - No one knows I lost my soul long ago.
 - If you can’t stand the way this place is take yourself to higher places.
 - If you feel so empty So used up, so let down If you feel so angry So ripped off so stepped on You’re not the only one Refusing to back down You’re not the only one So get up.
 - I try to live without you, everytime I do I feel dead.
