 - I’ve had some movies that have been ridiculed, but that’s OK with me. I don’t feel that really defines me. Should I change who I am to be popular?

 - When you try to portray people’s lives, you try to make sure you don’t portray them as clowns and that you give them a level of dignity. You don’t try to change their persona, but you try to understand that they had unique problems, set in a century that you don’t live.
 - Sometimes it takes a partner to say, “What is it you want?” because I think we operate in life and sometimes we don’t know. We’re all in some kind of maze going after the cheese at the end, and we get it and we go, “What is it that we want?”
