 - There are no coincidences.
 - Dig deep. Find your way to your soul.
 - There’s something about sitting alone in the dark that reminds you how big the world really is, and how far apart we all are. The stars look like they’re so close, you could reach out and touch them. But you can’t. Sometimes things look a lot closer than they are.
 - Maybe it needed to be broken. Sometimes things have to break before you can fix them.
 - This isn’t going to be some freaky pagan sex thing, is it?

 - High school sucked. It was a universal truth, and whoever said these were supposed to be the best years of your life was probably drunk or delusional.
 - Ethan: I love you, I whispered in her ear. She held my face in her hands and leaned back so she could look at me. Lena: I don’t think I could ever love anything the way I love you.
 - I said it, just like that. No stupid jokes, no changing the subject. For once, I wasn’t embarrassed, because it was the truth. I had fallen. I think I had always been falling. And she might as well know, if she didn’t already, because there was no going back now. Not for me.

 - Fate decides until challenged by the fated.
 - Stairway to Hell or Yellow Brick Road? Why don’t you give your Magic 8 Ball a shake and see if it’s ready to play again.

 - The thing about fate is, are you the master of your fate, or are the stars?
 - Fate is a wheel that turns without our hand.
 - I care. They bother me. And that’s why I’m stupid. That makes me exponentially more stupid than stupid. I’m stupid to the power of stupid.
 - I’d never really thought past the whole dying-for-the-sake-of-the-world part of things. When you’re alive, you don’t dwell on how you’re going to spend your time once you’re dead. You just figure you’re gone, and the rest will pretty much take care of itself.
 - Darkness, real darkness, was more than just a lack of light.

 - Sharpie? A mischievous smile spread across her face. I thought you said you couldn’t control your powers. Beginner’s luck.
 - Do you believe in love after last sight?
 - Even in the slippery blur of heat and arms and noise, Lena affected everything in her wake, a pull as powerful as the moon to the tides, or the planets to the sun. I was caught in her orbit, even as she pulled away from mine.
 - I had never been this mad at her before. It was one thing to be attacked by someone you hated, but this was something else. This was the kind of hurt that could only be inflicted by someone you loved, who you thought loved you. It was sort of like being stabbed from the inside out.
 - Why would you stick someone you love down in a lonely hole in the dirt? Where it’s cold, and dirty, and full of bugs?

 - It almost felt like she was sucking it all out of me, like she sucked on that sticky red lollipop, the one she kept licking as she drove.
 - Lena’s hair was sticking out in about fifteen directions, and her eyes were all small and puffy from crying. So this was what girls looked like in the morning. I had never seen one, not up close.
 - Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.
 - You’re incredibly, absolutely, extremely, supremely, unbelievably different.
 - Got it. Demon. Death. Doom.
 - Just as I lay back, she sat up. I sat up, and she flopped back down. Awkward. That was my every move when it came to her. Now we were both lying down, staring up at the blue sky.
 - I loved her, atom by atom, one burning cell at a time.
 - It smelled like aging wood and creosote, plastic book covers, and old paper. Old paper, which my mom used to say was the smell of time itself.
 - I may have been a Wayward, but my way was full of people who loved me. They were the only way I knew.

 - Ethan thought he was doing the right thing. He knew it was crazy. And he didn’t want to go, but he had to anyway. Ethan was like that. Even if he was dead. He saved the world, but he shattered mine. What now?
 - Age-appropriate makeup? Who are you people? What makeup is age-appropriate for a seven-year-old?
 - And you couldn’t control who you loved, even if you wanted to. That had been Genevieve’s problem with Ethan Carter Wate. It had been Uncle Macon’s problem with Lila, Link’s with Ridley. Probably even Ridley’s with Link. Love was how all these knots started to unravel in the first place.
 - I’d ridden to school with Link every day since kindergarten, when we became best friends after he gave me half his Twinkie on the bus. I only found out later it had fallen on the floor.
 - The ways I could hurt her and hurt myself. Those two things were intertwined somehow. It’s hard to explain, but when you were as closed off as I was the past few months, opening felt as wrong as stripping naked in church.

 - It’s hard to imagine a place like that really exists. People have been judging me my whole life.

 - So why did I think about her every second? Why was I so much happier the minute I saw her? I felt like maybe I knew the answer, but how could I be sure? I didn’t know, and I didn’t have any way to find out. Guys don’t talk about stuff like that. We just lie under the pile of bricks.
