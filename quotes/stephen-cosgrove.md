 - Never judge someone By the way he looks Or a book by the way it’s covered; For inside those tattered pages, There’s a lot to be discovered.
 - You may see all that is around you But you may feel nothing at all. So try and close your eyes so tight And listen to the night time fall.
 - When you’re feeling lonely and no one is around Remember to look inside yourself and a best friend will be found.
 - So when you’re cold From the inside out And don’t know what to do, Remember love and friendship, And warmth will come to you.
 - As you walk through forests or the meadows of your mind, Stop and talk to those you fear Good friendships you may find.
 - A friend cannot be owned That is plain to see Friendships must be shared, Just like our friend, Ruby.
 - Short is short and Tall is Tall You are what you are That is All!
 - As you walk, hop, hobble, or wheel Meeting people of different kinds, Remember that being handicapped Is only a state of mind.
