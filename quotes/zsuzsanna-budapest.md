 - The Goddess is Alive. Magic is afoot.
 - Mythology is the mother of religions, and grandmother of history.
 - The purpose of ritual is to wake up the old mind in us, to put it to work. The old ones inside us, the collective unconscious, the many lives, the divine eternal parts, the senses and parts of the brain that have been ignored.
 - Religion controls inner space; inner space controls outer space.
 - Every new social structure strives to come up with some kind of mythology of divine origin for its values and aims.
