 - Schizophrenia demons live in my head.
 - Rock music pays off. Rock music takes me on a joyride. Rock music keeps me off the hell city bus. Rock music will always look out for me. But I will not let my torture profanity demon shoot it down.
 - Here’s what I’m going to have to say to all of you. If some of you have demons in your head who talk to you in profanity or whatever, don’t let your demon shoot down your rock music, don’t let your demon keep you off the joy bus. So like I say, Rock music pays off.
 - I’m doing what I want to do, and I don’t care what you think you need!
 - Quit shouting those rerun songs at me.
