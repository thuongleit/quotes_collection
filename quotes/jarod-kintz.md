 - You could empty the trash and my love for you still wouldn’t fit inside. But just because it won’t fit, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t empty the trash.
 - I find out a lot about myself by sleeping. Dreams, they are who I am when I’m too tired to be me.

 - The wind blew my words away from you. So while I told you I love you, the phrase was carried in the opposite direction and landed 333 miles away in the ears of a confused farmer. He was nice, though. He sent me a kind letter saying that while he was flattered, I wasn’t really his type.
 - I know a thing or two about love. Well, maybe just a thing. A big, blurry thing, like Bigfoot.
 - I saw this beautiful girl the other day. She had an ass behind her that seemed to go on for days. In fact, I’m still going on about her.
 - People always ask me if I’m into sports, and I say, “Well, isn’t writing a sport? If you’re doing it right, and you have a deadline, you should be sweating.”?

 - A Kiss is a terrible name for a piece of chocolate shaped like a water droplet, because kisses are hot and would melt chocolate – even if it is wearing an astronaut suit made out of tinfoil.
 - I think it would be neat to meet a man who slept with one eye open, especially if that man was a Cyclops.
 - I wonder if rooms in an insane asylum have Do Not Disturb signs for the doors. I should hope not, because knock or no knock, every occupant in those rooms is already disturbed.
 - I’m very close to my dad. He’s about six inches away right now and snoring in my ears.

 - I blew the love trumpet until my cheeks were blue. Then I paid 34 bucks for a taxicab ride home so I could admire my receding hairline in the mirror.

 - The sunset faded and blended from pink to peach to mango in a smoothie in the sky. For as long as she doesn’t love me, I will love her.

 - I believe the love shared between two people shouldn’t be secretly shared with a third. Not even if I am vacationing on the moon, and that third person is my clone.
 - I got a new car. I just need to put it together. They’re easier to steal piece by piece.
 - I want to spend less time talking about myself, and more time listening to what other people have to say about me.

 - I have good news and I have bad news. The good news is that your house hasn’t burned down, you don’t have cancer, and your daughter hasn’t been raped or murdered. The bad news is that I ran over your dog. And your son. And his wife. But not before I ran out of gas to achieve all of that.

 - Some people try to change the world one life at a time. Others try to change the world one death at a time. And I try to change the world one bucket full of dirt at a time.
 - Leave the cage open. If you love someone, give them a chance to leave. You can always lock them up again should they return to you.
 - The reason it’s hard for men to say “I love you” is because those three words represent 10% of the average man’s vocabulary.

 - If loving someone is putting them in a straitjacket and kicking them down a flight of stairs, then yes, I have loved a few people.

 - With a palindrome of a name, like Bob, I’d be both right thinking and dyslexic. Would you love me more as a Bob, or as a Bob?

 - The good, the bad, and the ugly basically sums up my sex life. Except that I’ve never had the good.

 - I said I’d drive to her place. But she lives in her car, so I don’t see why she couldn’t just drive her place to my place.
 - I hate when I’m at the grocery store and the person checking me out asks, “Paper or plastic?” It’s offensive. As if I’m going to sleep with her just because she has a clever pick up line.

 - I promised her the world, but instead I bought her a globe.
 - I want to be a naughty pirate, because when I put on that eye patch, it barely covers my genitals.

 - I want to hang from a tree the way Spanish moss hung from my father’s face, like the mustache he was so embarrassed he couldn’t grow.
 - My father sacrificed his life for our family when I was growing up. He was one of the bravest, wisest, and most unselfish goats I have ever known, and I will miss his cheese dearly.
 - When I’m in a relationship, I love like a burrito. And if you’re a taco, don’t talk to me. At our core we may seem similar, but trust me, we are two different items on the menu.
 - When our dreams were nothing more than pancake batter, I was there for her, making breakfast.
 - There’s nothing funny about war. Well, aside from this joke Orafoura told me: What did WWI say to WWII? I wish I could tell you the punch line, but the restaurant was so noisy that I didn’t hear it. But I laughed anyway, because I’ll bet it was pretty funny.
 - I want to upholster the inside lining of my nostrils with leather, to have that “new car smell” all the time.

 - If sharks really can smell blood, then I’d imagine they’re all salivating over my erection right now.
 - One thing I often get carried away with is piggyback rides.
 - I made a graph of my emotions, a chart, and when I looked it over I was amazed to notice that the day Agatha broke up with me looked identical to the stock market crash of 1929. I thought I was the Irving Fisher of love.
 - I want to meet a guy named Art. I’d take him to a museum, hang him on the wall, criticize him, and leave.

 - She says he says, but she could be lying to me, and he could be lying to her, so I can’t believe her, even if I could believe her.
 - Love is the jelly to sunshine’s peanut butter. And if I tell you that I’m in sandwich with you, I’m not just saying it to get in your Ziploc bag.

 - The only gift I have to give, is the ability to receive. If giving is a gift, and it surely is, then my gift to you is to allow you to give to me.
 - I told her, “I admire your mustache madam, but I wonder, what’s for dessert?” Knowing her and knowing me, she probably thought I meant I love you.

 - I want to never stop growing as a person. I’d love to be well over 8 feet tall.
 - Grandpa always used to make me ride in the bed of his pickup truck, so he could keep up his conversations with the 100-pound sack of manure he kept buckled up in the passenger seat. Grandpa said all they ever talked about was grass, but I know Grandpa used to do a little flirting, too.
 - Half of what I write is garbage, but if I don’t write it down it decomposes in my head.

 - Love is like a door knob that I’ve mistaken for a shower handle, and I’m trying to turn up the heat on our relationship, but the handle won’t turn and I’ve got shampoo in my eyes and my wetsuit is dry and I started crying just as the zookeeper asked me to leave.
 - I made a nap this afternoon. I made it out of two pillows, a bed, a sheet, a blanket, and exhaustion.
