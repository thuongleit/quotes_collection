 - I believe the reason I love painting so much is that it forces one to be objective.
 - What I want to show in my work is the idea which hides itself behind so-called reality.
 - I am seeking for the bridge which leans from the visible to the invisible through reality.

 - When spiritual, metaphysical, material, or immaterial events come into my life, I can only fix them by way of painting.
 - If you wish to get hold of the invisible you must penetrate as deeply as possible into the visible.
 - There is nothing I hate more than sentimentality.

 - The stronger and more intense my desire becomes to capture and record that which is unsayable, the more tightly my mouth stays shut.

 - What matters is real love for things of the world outside us and for the deep secrets within us.

 - What are you? What am I? Those are the questions that constantly persecute and torment me and perhaps also play some part in my art.

 - My figures come and go, suggested by fortune or misfortune. I try to fix them divested of their apparent accidental quality.
 - I passed blindly many things which belong to real and political life.
