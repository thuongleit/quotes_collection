 - It’s not who you know, it’s who you blow. I don’t have a hole in my jeans for nothing.
 - I don’t work off lights and angles; I work off emotions. A mood that I create.
 - Like Robert Mapplethorpe, Helmut Newton, and so many others before me, sexual imagery has always been a part of my photography.
 - I like using snapshot cameras because they’re idiot-proof. I have bad eyesight, and I’m no good at focusing big cameras.
 - It’s insane, the internet. Totally craziness. Like a little cancer. People can just do whatever they want, say whatever they want, be totally anonymous. It’s totally out of control.
 - People go, ‘What do you want to do?’ What do you want to do? What are you feeling? Going into a shoot not fully knowing what I want to do – that excitement, that thing that happens, is just so powerful and makes such great pictures.
 - I always say I make pictures rather than take pictures.
 - I want my photos to be fresh and urgent. A good photograph should be a call to arms.
