 - Do you know what separates adults from children? Self-discipline. We don’t want to go to work, we don’t want to do our chores, and we don’t want to make unpleasant decisions, but we do all those things because we’re aware of the consequences which will follow if we don’t.
 - Put your badass face on and follow me.
 - Need some help, Ass Kicker?
 - I think you’re confused as to the nature of our relationship. You and I, we don’t get along. You’re a psychopathic control freak. You order me around and I want to kill you. I’m a pigheaded insubordinate ass. I drive you mad and you want to strangle me.
 - I can’t give you the white picket fence, and if I did, you’d set it on fire.
 - Maybe if I prayed to Miss Marple, she’d hook me up with a clue.
 - People around me die. They drop like flies. I’ve gone through life leaving a trail of dead bodies behind me. My mother is dead, my guardian is dead, my aunt is dead – because I killed her, and when my real father finds me, he’ll move heaven and earth to make me dead.
 - All men are liars. All women are liars, too.

He galloped through the steak house, skidded on the floor, smashed into my chair, and dropped a dead rat on my lap. Awesome.
 - No matter what happens, you will always be Pack. Because you have that loyalty and restraint. Not human, not whatever, but Kate. Unique and different, but not separate.

 - Big bad merc, down with a basic hip toss. In your place I’d be blushing.
 - Black hair, angelic face, and devil eyes.
 - I don’t trust tragedies much. It’s easy to make a person sad by showing him something tragic. We all recognize when sad things happen: someone dies, someone loses a loved one, young love is crushed. It’s much harder to make a man laugh-what’s funny to one person isn’t funny to another.

 - Half-man, half-beast, all nightmare. The shapeshifter warrior form.
 - Go home, kiss your wives, hug your children and put your affairs in order, because tomorrow I will burn your neighborhood to the ground. We will kill you, your families, your neighbors, your pets, and anyone who will stand in our path. An attack on my family will not go unpunished.
 - But she was funny sometimes, and never boring. God, it would almost be worth it to see her face when she realized that I had saved her ass again. Actually it was quite a nice ass, come to think of it. In fact, my memory of the ass and its owner seemed to be remarkably clear.
 - And just when I thought the pain had dulled, my mind would betray me and bring Dad back to life in my dreams. Sometimes I didn’t realize that he was dead until I awoke and then it was like a punch in the stomach. And sometimes I knew in my dream that I was dreaming, and I woke up crying.
 - Yep, Atlanta was burning. Again.
 - Kate Daniels, trained negotiator. When in possession of some valuable information, give it away to the first sexy man you see with no guarantee of return.

 - It’s awful to be rich and mind-boggingly handsome and have women fawn over you. My heart bleeds for you. Poor dear, how do you manage?
 - I’d give him a cup of coffee and a big helping of a knuckle sandwich. Generosity was a virtue and I was in the mood to be extremely virtuous.
 - Technically, the dance worked best when done naked, but I didn’t feel like prancing in the nude into Morrigan Hound’s arms. I’m sure he’d be thrilled to see me.
 - Ve haf vays of making you gif us your DNA sample.
 - There is no such thing as privacy between a deity and his worshipper. There are no secrets, no glossed-over failures. Only promises kept and abandoned, sins committed and imagined, and raw emotion. How many of us are ready to have our lives judged? What would happen if we were found wanting?
 - You look like Curran. You have that pissy exasperated look on your face.
 - Kate Daniels, deadly swordmaster. Fear my twitching pinkie.
 - Curran and I mixed about as well as glycerin and nitric acid: put us together, shake a bit, and hit the deck as we exploded.
 - I could have fixed almost everything else, but death defeated me every time.
 - Look at my big teeth. I’m an apex predator. My genetic material is awesome.
 - Living in your dreams meant bitter disappointment when you woke up.
 - I got a dog-training book. It says Grendel needs mental stimulation, so I tried to train him, but I think he must be retarded.
 - I love you, and you’re the measure of my wrath. Declan.
 - Peope, especially unhappy people, want a cause. They want something to belong to, to be a part of something great and bigger, and to be led. It’s easy to be a cog in a machine: you don’t have to think, you have no responsibility. You’re just following orders, doing as you’re told.
 - Every time I think you’ve reached the limits of arrogance, you show me new heights. Truly, your egotism is like the Universe – ever expanding.
 - Life was too short and ended too suddenly. If you didn’t take advantage of what you had today, tomorrow it might be ripped from you.

 - Some women waited for a night in shining armor. She, apparently, had ended up with a knight in black jeans and leather, who wanted to chase her down and have his evil way with her.

 - I stopped the blade two inches before it touched Andrea’s neck. Because she was my best friend, and sticking knives into your best friend’s windpipe was generally considered to be a social faux pas.
 - Having a fling with you doesn’t appeal to me. You’re handsome, but you’re too inexperienced to be good in bed. Having ridden many horses doesn’t make you a good rider; it just proves that you can’t recognize a good one or don’t know how to keep her.
 - Failure happened. The trick was to accept the risk and try anyway.
 - Wiggles hissed as I crossed the floor toward the throne. She fixed me with her empty hateful eyes and smelled the air, her long tongue shivering through the slit of the lipless mouth. Nice to see you too, sweetheart. Remember my cattle prod?

 - Getting a lecture on restraint from the woman who threw a hissy fit and blew up Babylon.
 - I picked up the phone and dialed Andrea’s extension. “Yes?” “He glued the chair to my ass.” Silence.
 - Derek favored his left side. His horse refused to bear him. I couldn’t blame the horse. I wouldn’t want his demonic, undead-blood-smeared, wolf-smelling ass riding me, either. But it made us slow.

 - He was going to take a dive into this lake. He just didn’t know it. Cerise rose, finding footing in the soft mud. The water came up to just below her breasts and her wet shirt stuck to her body. William’s gaze snagged on her chest. Yep, keep looking, Lord Bill. Keeeeeep looking.
 - He gave an impression of coiled power, a contained violence that if released, would explode with terrifying intensity.

 - Rose pictured him standing at the boundary of the Ogletree house in that enormous fur cape, with a giant sword sticking over his shoulder, roaring at the top of his lungs and then being upset that nobody came out, and laughed.
 - I gave him my best cryptic smile. He did not fall down to his feet, kiss my shoes, and promise me the world. I must be getting rusty.

 - The idiot had shot their own dog. That’s what happened when the destructive potential of a man’s weapons exceeded his intelligence.
