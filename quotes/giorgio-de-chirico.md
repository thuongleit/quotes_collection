 - There is much more mystery in the shadow of a man walking on a sunny day, than in all religions of the world.
 - When I close my eyes my vision is even more powerful.
 - If a work of art is to be truly immortal, it must pass quite beyond the limits of the human world, without any sign of common sense and logic. In this way the work will draw nearer to dream and to the mind of a child.
 - We must hold enormous faith in ourselves.
 - One must picture everything in the world as an enigma, and live in the world as if in a vast museum of strangeness.
 - Although the dream is a very strange phenomenon and an inexplicable mystery, far more inexplicable is the mystery and aspect our minds confer on certain objects and aspects of life.

 - To become truly immortal, a work of art must escape all human limits: logic and common sense will only interfere. But once these barriers are broken, it will enter the realms of childhood visions and dreams.
 - Art is the fatal net which catches these strange moments on the wing like mysterious butterflies, fleeing the innocence and distraction of common men.
 - It used to be that painters were crazy and sculptors clever. Today itâ€™s the other way around.
