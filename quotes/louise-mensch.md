 - Of course women can have it all – if they want it all. I won’t hear any defeatist talk. If you just dwell on problems, you won’t get anywhere fast.
 - Money gives you the power to do whatever you want to do. I like the idea of being in complete control of my life.
 - I want to retire very early, by the time I am 40, and go to live in Italy.
 - Abuse directed at women is always sexual or violent.
 - I like motivational books, because I like the go-getting American spirit – your destiny is in your own hands, life is what you make it, don’t accept your limitations, jump before you’re pushed, leap before you look.
 - In my view, the future of politics is, without a doubt, social liberalism married to economic conservatism. Which means we have to make an economic argument to social liberals, that it’s OK to vote for us. But we won’t run the economy into the ground at the same time.
 - Kane and Abel’ is the best popular fiction of all time. As a kid, I wanted to be prime minister when I read ‘First Among Equals.

 - The nature of the internet is that you don’t know who is behind the screen.
 - Once you are a proper, serious law-maker, you can’t break the laws you’re writing.
 - What I enjoy doing is challenging stereotypes of what people believe a Tory must be. You don’t have to say every Tory is in it for themselves – it’s pathetic caricaturing that has no place in the 21st century, and if we can challenge that stereotype, then great.
 - I have no ambitions to be a cabinet minister, or prime minister. I wouldn’t wish being prime minister on my worst enemy.

 - Your moral stance depends on what you think is being aborted. If you don’t believe it to be a person but part of a woman’s body, of course you will be pro-choice. I would be virulently pro-choice if I didn’t believe it to be a person.
 - I’m not embarrassed about the novels I wrote when I was younger, but I couldn’t write them today because of my religion.

 - Are you trivialising the sisterhood if you dye your hair or have your eyebrows threaded? I’d say the answer to that is no. But equally, it’s a perfectly valid feminist thing to say there is a certain amount of attention on a woman’s appearance, and I don’t wish that to be the focus or a distraction.
 - I fundamentally believe that politics is counterintuitive. The left think they’re helping working people by providing more rights, but all that actually happens is you create poverty and despair, because jobs go to your competitors who have fewer rights for workers.
