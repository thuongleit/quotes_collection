 - But if you can expand that consciousness, make it grow, then when you read about that book, you’ll have more understanding; when you look out, more awareness; when you wake up, more wakefulness; as you go about your day, more inner happiness.

 - My cow is not pretty, but it is pretty to me.

 - Intuition is knowingness, and this field of unbounded knowing, of knowingness, is within every human being. You start tapping into that and it becomes an ocean of solutions.
 - Negativity is the enemy of creativity. For instance if you’re filled with depression, you can hardly even get out of bed, let alone feel like creating something. If you are filled with bitter, selfish anger, this occupies the mind and leaves little room for creative ideas.
 - The mantra that you’re given in Transcendental Meditation you keep to yourself. The reason being, true happiness is not out there, true happiness lies within.
 - We only dream of images we already have inside of us.
 - New mysteries. New day. Fresh doughnuts.

 - Meditation is to dive all the way within, beyond thought, to the source of thought and pure consciousness. It enlarges the container, every time you transcend. When you come out, you come out refreshed, filled with energy and enthusiasm for life.
 - Every single thing in the world that was made by anyone started with an idea. So to catch one that is powerful enough to fall in love with, it is one of the most beautiful experiences. It’s like being jolted with electricity and knowledge at the same time.
 - All my movies are about strange worlds that you can’t go into unless you build them and film them. That’s what’s so important about film to me. I just like going into strange worlds.
 - Music deals with time and timing. It’s so magical, but when you get into it, every little sound and every little space between the sounds, it’s critical, so critical. And if it’s not there, it not only feels wrong, but it ruins things.
 - See, a painting is much cheaper than making a film. And photography is, you know, way cheap. So if I get an idea for a film, there are many ways to get it together and go realise that film. There’s really nothing to be afraid of.
 - Eraserhead is my most spiritual movie. No one understands when I say that, but it is.
 - A lot of artists think they want anger. But a real, strong, bitter anger occupies the mind, leaving no room for creativity.
 - You need contrast and conflict in order to tell a story. Stories need to have dark and light, turmoil, all those things. But that does not mean the filmmaker has to suffer in order to show the suffering. Stories should have the suffering, not the people.
 - Negativity is the enemy of creativity.
 - Stories always have held conflicts and contrasts, highs and lows, life and death situations. And there can be much suffering in stories, but now we say the artist doesn’t have to suffer to show suffering. You just have to understand the human condition, understand the suffering.

 - Absurdity is what I like most in life.
 - Domestic violence and violence against women in general seems to be a big problem everywhere in the world. It seems to me this problem comes from stress, pent up anger, frustration, and all kinds of negativity within human beings.
 - It’s better not to know so much about what things mean or how they might be interpreted or you’ll be too afraid to let things keep happening.
 - Absurdity is what I like most in life, and there’s humor in struggling in ignorance. If you saw a man repeatedly running into a wall until he was a bloody pulp, after a while it would make you laugh because it becomes absurd.
 - Cigarettes are pretty much my worst vice, and I even stopped smoking for 20 years. I spend most of my free time with my family and working on art.
 - Happy accidents are real gifts, and they can open the door to a future that didn’t even exist. It’s kind of nice sometimes to set up something to encourage or allow happy accidents to happen.

 - Dark things have always existed but they used to be in a proper balance with good when life was slower.
 - I let the actors work out their ideas before shooting, then tell them what attitudes I want. If a scene isn’t honest, it stands out like a sore thumb.
 - I find the joy of the ‘doing’ increases. Creativity increases. Intuition increases. The pleasure of life grows. And negativity recedes.
 - A film is its own thing and in an ideal world I think a film should be discovered knowing nothing and nothing should be added to it and nothing should be subtracted from it.
 - The artist doesn’t have to suffer to show suffering. Have it on the screen but have the people come out of the theater into a world of peace, of a beautiful world. They don’t have to suffer in their lives.
 - I truly believe there is a field of peace within and that it can be enlivened and brought to the surface to be enjoyed by all.
 - I have no problem getting financing. I have a problem catching ideas that I fall in love with for the next feature.
 - If we didn’t want to upset anyone, we would make films about sewing, but even that could be dangerous. But I think finally, in a film, it is how the balance is and the feelings are. But I think there has to be those contrasts and strong things within a film for the total experience.
 - The only thing that disturbs me is that many psychopaths say they had a very happy childhood.
 - Be true to yourself. Don’t take no for an answer. And start your Transcendental Meditation.
 - I like things that go into hidden, mysterious places, places I want to explore that are very disturbing. In that disturbing thing, there is sometimes tremendous poetry and truth.
 - My mother refused to give me coloring books as a child. She probably saved me, Because when you think about it, what a coloring book does is completely kill creativity.
 - I look at the world and I see absurdity all around me. People do strange things constantly, to the point that, for the most part, we manage not to see it. That’s why I love coffee shops and public places – I mean, they’re all out there.
 - This whole world is wild at heart and weird on top.

 - Some things we forget. But many things we remember on the mental screen, which is the biggest screen of all.
 - It makes me uncomfortable to talk about meanings and things. It’s better not to know so much about what things mean. Because the meaning, it’s a very personal thing, and the meaning for me is different than the meaning for somebody else.
 - Desire for an idea is like bait. When you’re fishing, you have to have patience. You bait your hook, and then you wait. The desire is the bait that pulls those fish in-those ideas.
 - If a scene isn’t honest, it stands out like a sore thumb.
 - In the world there’s a thing called collective consciousness. All of us billions of human beings together create that collective consciousness. With all the problems in our world, you can see that the collective consciousness is not so high.
 - Cinema is a medium that can translate ideas. But wood can translate ideas, too. You have wood and then you get a chair. Some ideas are for different things.
 - You don’t dive for specific solutions; you dive to enliven that ocean of consciousness. Then your intuition grows and you have a way of solving those problems-knowing when it’s not quite right and knowing a way to make it feel correct for you. That capacity grows and things go much more smoothly.
 - I love child things because there’s so much mystery when you’re a child.
 - It’s crazy to close doors to any genres.

 - Transcendental Meditation is not a religion, it’s not against any religion, it’s for human beings, no matter what color, what religion, what walk of life. If you’re a human being, it will work for you. And you will be very glad you found this technique and took advantage of it.
 - I thought when I started meditation that I was going to get real calm and peaceful and it’s going to be over. It’s not that way; it’s so energetic. That’s where all the energy and creativity is.
 - Humor is very interesting to me. My films are not comedies, but there’s comedy in them from time to time, absurdities, just like in real life.
 - I love Christmas tree bulbs, and I started putting them in my paintings. You’ve got to plug this painting in, and it’s got a rig in the back, so that each one can be replaced if it burns out.
 - I’m not a musician, but I play music. So it’s a strange thing.
 - I’m lost in a transition. The old is dead, and I don’t know what the new is. The only way to find the new is to start different things and see if there’s something that can come out of experimentation. It’s somewhat unsettling, but it’s a hopeful thing in a way. I’ve been here before, lots of times.
 - My rule of thumb is, what Siskel and Ebert like, I don’t, and vice versa.
 - One change of attitude would change everything. If everyone realized that it could be a beautiful world and said, ‘let’s not do these things anymore – let’s have fun.’

 - The concept of absurdity is something I’m attracted to.
 - I always say that intuition is the number one tool for an artist.
 - You could say that spirituality is bliss, and bliss is physical happiness, emotional happiness, mental happiness, and spiritual happiness. And it’s intense. It’s an intense happiness. It brings you together with everything.

 - I don’t like Thomas Edison. I’m a fan of Nicolai Tesla.
 - With each experience of the unbounded ocean of consciousness, you infuse it into your life and therefore expand whatever consciousness you had to begin with.
 - The interesting thing that happens for many people when they first start meditating is that they’ll be doing it for a few months, and they will begin to change, but the experience is so subtle that they’re not even aware of it.
 - I felt I should have been the happiest person in the world. But I looked inside, and that happiness was only on the surface, not so deep. Beneath it was hollow. Up until that time, I had been thinking meditation was a joke, a fad and a waste of time.
 - Somewhere in talking and rehearsing, there is a magical moment where actors catch a current, they’re on the right road. If they really catch it, then whatever they do from then on is correct and it all comes out of them from that point on.

 - We’re like lightbulbs. If bliss starts growing inside you, it’s like a light; it affects the environment.
 - Life is filled with abstractions, and the only way to make heads or tails of it is going through intuition.
 - Anger, stress, tension, depression, sorrow, hate, fear – these things start to retreat. And for a filmmaker, having this negativity lift away is money in the bank. When you’re suffering you can’t create.
 - I always say Philadelphia, Pennsylvania is my biggest influence. But for painters, I like many, many painters, but I love Francis Bacon the most, and Edward Hopper.
 - I don’t think that people accept the fact that life doesn’t make sense. I think it makes people terribly uncomfortable. It seems like religion and myth were invented against that, trying to make sense out of it.
 - Films are 50 percent visual and 50 percent sound. Sometimes sound even overplays the visual.
 - Intuition is the key to everything, in painting, filmmaking, business – everything. I think you could have an intellectual ability, but if you can sharpen your intuition, which they say is emotion and intellect joining together, then a knowingness occurs.
 - My movies are film-paintings – moving portraits captured on celluloid. I’ll layer that with sound to create a unique mood – like if the Mona Lisa opened her mouth, and there would be a wind, and she’d turn back and smile. It would be strange and beautiful.
 - Stories hold conflict and contrast, highs and lows, life and death, and the human struggle and all kinds of things.
 - We all have at least two sides. The world we live in is a world of opposites. And the trick is to reconcile those opposing things. I’ve always liked both sides. In order to appreciate one you have to know the other. The more darkness you can gather up, the more light you can see too.
 - I’ve said many, many, many unkind things about Philadelphia, and I meant every one.
 - A filmmaker doesn’t have to suffer to show suffering. You just have to understand it. You don’t have to die to shoot a death scene.
 - Digital video is so beautiful. It’s lightweight, modern, and it’s only getting better. It’s put film into the La Brea Tar Pits.
 - I love super crispy, almost burned, snapping-crispy bacon.
 - The big treasury is an ocean of infinite creativity. It’s a creativity that creates everything that is a thing – it’s mighty powerful creativity.

 - Mystery is the number one conjurer of ideas.
 - Someday, hopefully very soon, ‘diving within’ as a preparation for learning and as a tool for developing the creative potential of the mind will be a standard part of every school’s curriculum.
 - Every human being has consciousness, but not every human being has the same amount. The potential for each one of us human beings is infinite consciousness. This is called supreme enlightenment, and it just needs unfolding by transcending each day. The more consciousness we have, the better life is.
 - Surface cures are not going to get rid of the torment that’s inside.
 - I like making films because I like to go into another world. I like to get lost into another world.
 - Every time I hear sounds, I see pictures. Then, I start getting ideas. It just drives me crazy.
 - In today’s world of fear and uncertainty, every child should have one class period a day to dive within himself and experience the field of silence-bliss-t he enormous reservoir of energy and intelligence that is deep within all of us. This is the way to save the coming generation.
 - To me, a story can be both concrete and abstract, or a concrete story can hold abstractions. And abstractions are things that really can’t be said so well with words.
 - As a kid, I was always building things. My father had a shop in the house, and we built things – we were kind of a project family. I started out as a painter, and then painting led to cinema, and in cinema, you get to build so many things, or help build them.
 - I long for a kind of quiet where I can just drift and dream. I always say getting inspiration is like fishing. If you’re quiet and sitting there and you have the right bait, you’re going to catch a fish eventually. Ideas are sort of like that. You never know when they’re going to hit you.
 - Meditation is not a selfish thing. Even though you’re diving in and experiencing the Self, you’re not closing yourself off from the world. You’re strengthening yourself, so that you can be more effective when you go back into the world.
 - I have been ‘diving within’ through the Transcendental Meditation technique for over 30 years. It has changed my life, my world. I am not alone. Millions of other people of all ages, religions, and walks of life practice the technique and enjoy incredible benefits.
 - The artist does not have to suffer to show suffering.
 - I just love musicians. They’re not all super-happy all the time, but when they’re playing they’re happy, and it’s such a beautiful thing.

 - I like to feel like you can bite my paintings. Not to eat them, to hurt them. I like to feel like I’m painting with my teeth.
 - So much of what happened to me is good fortune. But I would say: Try to get a job that gives you some time; get your sleep and a little bit of food; and work as much as you can. There’s so much enjoyment in doing what you love. Maybe this will open doors, and you’ll find a way to do what you love.
 - Everyone is on the internet but they’re not all talking with each other. There are groups upon groups out there, but they don’t talk to one another. So while the internet brings everyone into a shared space, it does not necessarily bring them together.
 - I have to make what I see, whether it’s a painting, a table, or a movie, or it’s like a death and what would be the point of that?
 - When you get an idea and you fall in love with it there’s not a whole lot of choice. You’re going down a street and you meet this girl and you know it doesn’t have to make any sense. Bingo! You’re in love.
 - A lot of painters listen to music, I think, while they paint. But I hate to do that. It’s a horror. I can’t really listen to the music. I’m not really concentrating on it, and I’m not really concentrating on the painting.
 - I would rather not make a film than make one where I don’t have final cut.
 - Been trying the soapy water and instant coffee method. Works somewhat, but boy it tastes terrible. I don’t know how you guys can stand it. I’m going back to milk and espresso for my cappas.
 - Sometimes I get ideas for lyrics in anyplace, but I work a lot in the studio. So I collect little bits of lyrics. I go through the box of lyrics I have and see if something fits.
 - Because you make a world that didn’t exist before, and you can go into that world deeper and deeper. It’s unbounded out there. One film takes you into one area, another film takes you into another area. There could be trillions, zillions of worlds that exist in the big space.
 - In film, life-and-death struggles make you sit up, lean forward a little bit. They amplify things happening, in smaller ways, in all of us. These things show up in relationships. They show up in struggles and bring them to a critical point.
 - I like darkness and confusion and absurdity, but I like to know that there could be a little door that you could go out into a safe life area of happiness.
 - It’s so freeing, it’s beautiful in a way, to have a great failure, there’s nowhere to go but up.

 - Let’s get rid of the suffering and bring real peace, which is not just the absence of war, but the absence of all negativity.
 - Death in my mind isn’t a finality. There’s a continuum: It’s like at night, you go to sleep and in the daytime you wake up, or whenever you wake up, and it’s a new day.
 - People think in Hollywood there’s a family, where everybody gets together talks about stuff and we all know each other, and it’s just not that way at all to me.
 - I think that commercials can really ruin a song. You know that the person sold the song for a good deal of money, and that was the tradeoff. But, music and picture can marry in a beautiful way, and the reverse also.
 - Don’t make a film if it can’t be the film you want to make. It’s a joke, and a sick joke, and it’ll kill you.

 - Consciousness-based education, which I am helping to promote, is basically the same education that good schools are giving today with Transcendental Meditation added for the students, teachers, staff, and principal.
 - There’s always fear of the unknown where there’s mystery.
 - I love industry. Pipes. I love fluid and smoke. I love man-made things. I like to see people hard at work, and I like to see sludge and man-made waste.
 - Unfortunately, my ideas are not what you’d call commercial, and money really drives the boat these days. So I don’t know what my future is. I don’t have a clue what I’m going to be able to do in the world of cinema.
 - I have a profound admiration for Fellini. I met him lately and he’s just fantastic. I feel very close to him even though he’s very Italian. But his films could have been made in every country. When I say, I feel close to him, then also because we’re both born on January 20th.
 - Transcendental meditation is like a car, a vehicle that allows you to go within. It’s a mental technique.
 - The ideas dictate everything.
 - I think that ideas exist outside of ourselves. I think somewhere, we’re all connected off in some very abstract land. But somewhere between there and here ideas exist.
 - I’m not a real film buff. Unfortunately, I don’t have time. I just don’t go. And I become very nervous when I go to a film because I worry so much about the director and it is hard for me to digest my popcorn.
 - An artist makes a painting, and nobody bugs him or her about it. It’s just you and your painting. To me, that’s the way it should be with film as well.
 - I always loved smokestack industry, and I love towns or cities that have grown up around factories.
 - Music as background to me becomes like a mosquito, an insect. In the studio we have big speakers, and to me that’s the way music should be listened to. When I listen to music, I want to just listen to music.
 - I think part of the reason ideas haven’t come in is that the world of cinema is changing so drastically, and in a weird way, feature films I think have become cheap. Everything is kind of throwaway. It’s experienced and then forgotten.

 - Many things happen that we don’t know the significance of until a little bit later.

 - I believe in creative control. No matter what anyone makes, they should have control over it.
 - Being in darkness and confusion is interesting to me. But behind it you can rise out of that and see things the way the really are.
 - I like to remember things my own way. How I remembered them, not necessarily the way they happened.
