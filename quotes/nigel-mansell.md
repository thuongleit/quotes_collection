 - I’ve tried everything other than jumping out of a plane, but nothing gives you an adrenaline rush like racing a car.
 - I’ve been in motorsport my whole life since I was eight years of age.
 - I consider myself one of a very small handful of drivers in the world that are top drivers. The best one? I don’t think anybody can say they’re the best one because, from one week to the next, you can be on form or off form a little bit.
 - I think life is full of challenges and problems. I don’t believe that anyone is perfect. We all make mistakes. It’s not a bed of roses, and you have to work real hard at it.
 - The first race is really just something that we will all need to get through. Until people see the cars in action I don’t think they will understand how quick they will be, which means they are going to be tiring to drive.
 - Racing a thoroughbred grand prix car in front of a home crowd will be a surreal and mighty experience.
 - The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger.
 - Firstly the cars aren’t too complicated. They have no traction control, for example, which means you can spin if you try too hard and damage your tires if you’re not careful with your driving style.
 - Everything in Formula 1 has been sterilised now, the whole thing is controlled too much.
 - The hunger and desire to go racing, however, never leaves your blood but the right opportunity has never really come along – until now that is.
 - The Masters is going to be an awesome challenge.
 - Alain will do everything in his power to win, he doesn’t like getting beaten by anyone and least of all me.
 - I’ve always been reasonably fatalistic.
 - Fitness will be a major factor in the first race and I think that will play into the hands of drivers who have been racing recently, rather than people like me who haven’t raced properly for a decade. I’am not one of the favourites to start with.
 - Every GP Masters race will stand out because we will be available for fans, media and sponsors.
 - The format of the race weekend is also very well thought out. We have enough practice time to get the cars well set-up and have a proper qualifying session where we can do as many laps as we like, which is great for the drivers and spectators.
