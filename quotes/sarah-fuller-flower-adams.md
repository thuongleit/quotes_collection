 - Nearer, my God, to Thee.
 - He sendeth sun, he sendeth shower, alike theyâ€™re needed to the flower; and joys and tears alike are sent to give the soul its nourishment.
 - That which you bestow freely and willingly will bring you all the happy luck that a grateful universe knows how to return.
 - God I bring each wounded child to Thee.
