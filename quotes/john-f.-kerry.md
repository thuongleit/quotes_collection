 - The hope is there. The sun is rising. Our best days are yet to come.
 - Values spoken without actions taken are merely slogans.
 - Climate change is real. The science is compelling. And the longer we wait, the harder the problem will be to solve.
 - You can’t play sports without losing sometimes and, in losing, you learn something about grace and how to act under pressure.
 - War on terror is far less of a military operation and far more of an intelligence-gathering, law-enforcement operation.
 - I believe America’s best days are ahead of us because I believe that the future belongs to freedom, not to fear.
 - And now that the Greatest Generation is getting older, I think it is the responsibility of all Americans to make sure we do our part for America’s seniors. You have earned the best of America – and we need to make sure you get the protection and health care you deserve.
 - How do you ask a man to be the last man to die in Vietnam? How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake?
 - I know something about killing. I don’t like killing. And I don’t think a state honors life by turning around and sanctioning killing. Now, that’s just a personal belief that I have.
 - Our troops are terrorizing women and children in the dark of night in Iraq.
 - NAFTA recognizes the reality of today’s economy – globalization and technology. Our future is not in competing at the low-level wage job; it is in creating high-wage, new technology jobs based on our skills and our productivity.
 - I want to fully fund education, No Child Left Behind, special-needs education. And that’s how we’re going to be more competitive, by making sure our kids are graduating from school and college.
 - Values are not just words, values are what we live by. They’re about the causes that we champion and the people we fight for.
 - It’s pretty standard fare in political discourse. You misconstrue what somebody said. You isolate a statement, you lend your interpretation to it and then feign moral outrage. And Democrats have been doing it for years.
 - Middle class Americans don’t ask for special favors, they just want basic fairness, and a President who fights for that ideal.
 - I mean does Israel want a third Intifada?
 - Those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire.
 - This fight against drilling in the Arctic Refuge is a fight about our principles. Its about standing up for our environment, our families and our future, and I wont give up this fight.
 - I know something about aircraft carriers for real.
 - I don’t want to claim that God is on our side. As Abraham Lincoln told us, I want to pray humbly that we are on God’s side.
 - I’m an internationalist. I’d like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the directive of the United Nations.
 - I’m not insensitive to the jobs. I’m desperately concerned about those jobs. But you don’t fix them by pandering to people and telling them you’re going to shut the door. You have to grow jobs.
 - Patriots don’t go to Russia. They don’t seek asylum in Cuba. They don’t seek asylum in Venezuela. They fight their cause here. Edward Snowden is a coward. He is a traitor. And he has betrayed his country. And if he wants to come home tomorrow to face the music, he can do so.
 - It’s time we framed every question – every issue – not in terms of what’s in it for ‘me,’ but what’s in it for all of us?
 - I commanded a naval gunboat patrolling the Mekong Delta. Then when I came home after two tours of duty, I decided that the same sense of service demanded something more of me.
 - There are issues of war and peace. And then, there are issues of life and death like this one that are no less morally compelling than war itself.
 - There is no greater breach of the public trust than knowingly misleading the country into war. In a democracy, we simply cannot tolerate the abuse of this trust by the government.
 - We must retool our nation to prepare for the challenge we already face to maintain our position in the global economy. And this much is certain: America will not have national security without economic security.
 - I’m fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there’s a lot of poetry in it. There’s a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you’d better listen to it pretty carefully, ’cause it’s important.
 - Folks, Sarah Palin said she could see Russia from Alaska. Mitt Romney talks like he’s only seen Russia by watching ‘Rocky IV.’
 - As I have said for two years now, when Osama Bin Laden and al-Qaeda were cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, it was wrong to outsource the job of capturing them to Afghan warlords who a week earlier were fighting against us.
 - Politics has always been the art of the possible. Today it’s too often the art of the probable – tinkering around the edges without any greater vision, without a sense of optimism and imagination.
 - Today, if you’re an American business, you actually get a benefit for going overseas. You get to defer your taxes. So if you’re looking at a competitive world, you say to yourself, “Hey, I do better overseas than I do here in America.”
 - I’m sick and tired of these despicable Republican attacks that always seem to come from those who never can be found to serve in war, but love to attack those who did. I’m not going to be lectured by a stuffed suit White House mouthpiece standing behind a podium.
 - My definition of patriotism is to defend your country with the truth, no matter the consequences.
 - The problems of health care can be solved if we stop giving tax cuts to those who have the most, and start making health care affordable for those working harder and harder for too little.
 - No one is going to question my commitment to the defence of our nation. I don’t know what it is these Republicans, who didn’t serve in any war, have against those of us who are Democrats who did.
 - I personally didn’t see personal atrocities in the sense I saw somebody cut a head off or something like that. However, I did take part in free-fire zones, I did take part in harassment and interdiction fire, I did take part in search-and-destroy missions.
 - We must uphold the promise of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, and Clinton and never allow the President and his Republican friends to threaten Social Security by putting it on the Wall Street trading block.
 - We are not interested in a proxy war. Our objective is to change Russia’s behavior.
 - I don’t know what compassionate conservative means. Does it mean cutting kids out of after school programs, Does it mean drilling in the arctic wildlife refuge? Does it mean sending kids to Iraq without body armor that’s state of the art?
 - What we need to do is raise the minimum wage. We also need to hold onto equal pay. Women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do. That’s not right in America.
 - It’s hard to say that something is legitimate when a whole portion of the country can’t vote and doesn’t vote.
 - Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.
 - You don’t value families if you force them to take up a collection to buy body armor for a son or daughter in the service.

 - If we can’t have a serious conversation without politicizing it on cable TV and making it a scoring point for one day, we’re in trouble.
 - Unlike Washington, which is stuck in ideological gridlock, Americans feel the impact of climate change in their own hometowns and they know something must be done.
 - I will never conduct a war or start a war because we want to; the United States of America should only go to war because we have to. And if you live by that guidance, you’ll never have veterans throwing away their medals or standing up in protest.
 - We need a new approach to national security.
 - I’m proud of my medals. I always was proud of them.
 - Medicare is paid for by the American taxpayer. Medicare belongs to you. Medicare is for seniors, who many of them are on fixed income, to lift them out of poverty.
 - American can do better, and help is on the way.
 - There the Bush Administration has offered only a merry-go-round policy. They got up on their high horse, whooped and hollered, rode around in circles and ended right back where they’d started.
 - What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States.
 - The American spirit wears no political label. In service to others and yes, in sacrifice for our country, there are no Republicans; there are no Democrats; there are only Americans.
 - Terrorist organizations with specific political agendas may be encouraged and emboldened by Yasser Arafat’s transformation from outlaw to statesman.
 - I don’t think losing 3 million jobs, having deficits as far as the eye can go, having 2 million people lose their health insurance, turning your back on kids in schools and not funding No Child Left Behind represents a vision.
 - You’d be amazed at the number of people who want to introduce themselves to you in the men’s room. It’s the most bizarre part of this entire thing.
 - Our military is overextended. Nine out of 10 active-duty Army divisions are either in Iraq, going to Iraq or have come back from Iraq. One way or the other, they’re wrapped up in it.
 - If America is at war, I won’t speak a word without measuring how it’ll sound to the guys doing the fighting when they’re listening to their radios in the desert.
 - Republican secretaries of state from Kissinger to Baker, Powell to Rice, President Bush, 71 United States Senators all supported President Obama’s new START treaty, but not Mitt Romney.
 - Here I am in the state of New Mexico. George Bush is still in the state of denial. New Mexico has five electoral votes. The state of denial has none. I like my chances.
 - We are a nation of laws and liberties, not of a knock in the night. So it is time to end the era of John Ashcroft. That starts with replacing the Patriot Act with a new law that protects our people and our liberties at the same time.

 - In American elections there are no losers, because whether or not our candidates win or lose, the next morning we wake up as Americans.

 - And it is time for those who talk about family values to start valuing families.
 - I know that our country is strongest when we lead the world, when we lead strong alliances. And that’s the way Eisenhower and Reagan and Kennedy and others did it.
 - I am not a spokesperson for the church and the church is not a spokesperson for the United States of America. I’m running for president and I’m running to uphold the Constitution, which has a strict separation of church and state.
 - Think about this: terrorism, epidemics, poverty, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction-all challenges that know no borders-the reality is that climate change ranks right up there with every single one of them.
 - I still believe Americas destiny is to become a living testament to what free human beings can accomplish by acting in unity.
 - I promise just to serve two terms. Republicans do it differently. They just have the son repeat the father’s whole first term.
 - It’s one thing to be certain, but you can be certain and you can be wrong.
 - It appears that with the deadline for exile come and gone, Saddam Hussein has chosen to make military force the ultimate weapons inspections enforcement mechanism. If so, the only exit strategy is victory, this is our common mission and the world’s cause.
 - From the moment I take office, I will stand up to the special interests and stand with hardworking families so that we can give America back its future and its ideals.
 - I’m a Catholic, raised a Catholic. I was an altar boy. Religion has been a huge part of my life. It helped lead me through a war, leads me today.
 - There is a much cheaper way, less complicated way to bring Iraq and Saddam Hussein to its knees: it is simply to send the Bush economic team over there and let them run the country.
 - As the saying goes, I have big heels to fill.
 - The best way to begin genuine bipartisanship to make America stronger is to work together on the real crises facing our country, not to manufacture an artificial crisis to serve a special interest agenda out of touch with the needs of Americans.
 - Jesus did not help just the sick who could afford to pay for it.
 - President Clinton was often known as the first black president. I wouldn’t be upset if I could earn the right to be the second.
 - Mitt Romney says he believes in America and that he will restore American exceptionalism. I have news for him, we already have an exceptional American as president and we believe in Barack Obama.
 - I saw courage both in the Vietnam War and in the struggle to stop it. I learned that patriotism includes protest, not just military service.
 - The measurement in this race is not where you come from, it is “what do you fight for.”

 - The big hang-up was George Bush wanted to get life lines, you know, so he could call somebody.
 - I will never cede the authority of our country or our security to any other nation. I’ll never give a veto over American security to any other entity – not a nation, not a country, not an institution.
 - I know there are a lot of musicians and a lot of artists, and there are a lot of writers and other people who inspire young people, but I’d like to see somebody in political life be able to connect and make these choices that we need to make in Washington real in terms of people’s lives.
 - You just don’t invade another country on phony pretext in order to assert your interests!

 - The Future Belongs to Freedom, Not to Fear.
 - We deserve a president of the United States who will write laws for all Americans, not for campaign contributors. And I intend to be a president for all Americans who takes back the flag of our country because it doesn’t belong to any party, doesn’t belong to any president.
 - I look forward to standing up and holding George Bush accountable for pushing seniors off of Medicare into HMOs.

 - I would rather be the candidate of the NAACP than the NRA.

 - America deserves a real discussion about real policy.
 - Those who try to stifle the vibrancy of our democracy and shield policies from scrutiny behind a false cloak of patriotism miss the real value of what our troops defend and how we best defend our troops. We will ask questions and we will defend our democracy.
 - President Obama has made it his mission that we welcome our troops home with care and concern and the respect they deserve. That is how an exceptional nation says thank you to its most exceptional men and women.

 - The Ukrainian people should not be coerced. Make no mistake: the US stands together with the Ukrainians aspiring for democracy.

 - We do not need to divide America over who served and how. I have personally always believed that many served in many different ways.
