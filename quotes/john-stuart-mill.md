 - Those only are happy who have their minds fixed on some object other than their own happiness; on the happiness of others, on the improvement of mankind, even on some art or pursuit, followed not as a means, but as itself an ideal end. Aiming thus at something else, they find happiness by the way.

 - The individual is not accountable to society for his actions in so far as these concern the interests of no person but himself.
 - A general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another, and as the mould in which it casts them is that which pleases the dominant power in the government.
 - In its narrowest acceptation, order means obedience. A government is said to preserve order if it succeeds in getting itself obeyed.
