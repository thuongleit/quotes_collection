 - Being touched and caressed, being massaged, is food for the infant; food as necessary as minerals, vitamins, and proteins. Deprived of this food, the name of which is love, Babies would rather die. And often they do.
 - Birth may be a matter of a moment, but it is a unique one.

 - This tragic brow, these closed eyes, eyebrows raised and knotted.
