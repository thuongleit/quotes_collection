 - Every abstract picture of the world is as impossible as a blueprint of a storm. Don’t be ashamed because you’re human: be proud! Inside you, vaults behind vaults open endlessly. You will never be finished, and that’s as it should be.
 - We always feel younger than we are. I carry inside myself my earlier faces, as a tree contains its rings. The sum of them is me. The mirror sees only my latest face, while I know all my previous ones.
 - It is still beautiful to hear the heart beat but often the shadow seems more real than the body.
 - It’s always so early in here, before the crossroads, before the irrevocable choices. Thank you for this life! Still I miss the alternatives. The sketches, all of them, want to become real.
 - A ship’s engine far away on the water expands the summer-night horizon. Both joy and sorrow swell in the dew’s magnifying glass. Without really knowing, we divine; our life has a sister ship, following quietly another route. While the sun blazes behind the islands.
 - I am carried in my shadow like a violin in its black case.
 - In the middle of life, death comes to take your measurements. The visit is forgotten and life goes on. But the suit is being sewn on the sly.
 - A person shows himself for an instant as in a photograph but clearer and in the background something which is bigger than his shadow.
 - I am still the place where creation does some work on itself.
