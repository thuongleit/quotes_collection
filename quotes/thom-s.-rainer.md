 - So if we approach church membership from the perspective of entitlement, we have it upside down. You always ask first what you can do for your church.
 - Faith and optimism are contagious.
 - Some churches would rather die than to get out of the comfort of the past.
 - The concept of an inactive church member is an oxymoron. Biblically, no such church member really exists.
 - Confident and courageous leaders have no problems pointing out their own weaknesses and ignorance.
 - Churches should evaluate everything they do to determine how it can be done better.
 - Weak leaders of churches blame people and circumstances. Breakout church leaders accept responsibility and see Godâ€™s possibilities in even difficult situations.
 - Passion means making the choice to do that for which we can make the greatest difference. It means saying no to opportunities that may be good but not the best. It means that the best path is not always the easiest path.
 - Healthy church membership means you find your joy in being last, instead of seeking your way and being first.
