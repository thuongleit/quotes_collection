 - Why accept failure when success is free?
 - Wise men change, fools stay the same.
 - If you associate yourself with peer pressure or complacency, you’re destined for failure.
 - The energy in the daytime is so different because everyone is so unhappy and depressed and you can pick up on that energy psychokinetically. So I like to come out at night. Everything’s settled, you can see more.
 - Whatever an individual chooses to do with themselves, long as it doesn’t affect me and they’re respectful with it, I don’t care what they do. Because I’m not perfect and I have flaws, so who would I be to be judgmental?
