 - Theology is faith seeking understanding, but understanding is more than theoretical. If we really grasp who and where we are as disciples, we should know how to live out our faith.
 - Desire for God without doctrine is blind; doctrine without desire is empty.
 - Sola scriptura means at least this: that the church’s proclamation is always subject to potential correction from the canon. It is for this reason that we resist simply collapsing the text into the tradition of its interpretation and performance.
 - Christianity is neither a system of ideas nor of morality but a way, a way of life.
 - Pride does not listen. It knows.

 - Being a systematic theologian allows me to indulge all my interests – in literature, film, art, music – by relating them all to God.

 - I’m interested in the history of ideas and how these ideas take on flesh and influence culture, and the church.
