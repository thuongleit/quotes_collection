 - You never need to apologize for how you chose to survive.
 - All this time I drank you like the cure when maybe you were the poison.
 - I’m scared you will realize I’m just bones and questions and leave me for something solid.
 - My battered heart will always be where the ocean meets the sand, I will break over and over Every day. That is the best and worst part of me.
 - I will love you when you are a still day. I will love you when you are a hurricane.
 - I want a tattoo of the first morning we woke up together. I want the memory to hurt.
 - If anyone else were to kiss me, all they would taste is your name.
