 - To be or not to be?? That is not the question. What is the question? The question is not one of being, but of becoming. ‘To become more or not to become more’ This is the question faced by each intelligence in our universe.
 - The greatest tragedy of life is that, having paid that awful price of suffering “according to the flesh that his bowels might be filled with compassion,” and being now prepared to reach down and help us, he is forbidden because we won’t let him. We look down instead of up.
 - See that your difference makes a difference.
 - Come to him. He turns no penitent one away. Would you, if you had paid so much in suffering? Would you ever give up? All the doors that are locked against the Lord are locked by us.
