 - This is a very fickle and faithless generation.
 - My Lord, it is a very hard sentence. For my part, I am the innocentest person of them all, only I have been sworn against by perjured persons.
 - I do not care so much for the death of my gunner, as for other passages of my voyage, for I have good friends in England that will bring me off for that.
 - I have been sworn against by perjured and wicked people.
 - I would rather my soul broil in hell than I do you any harm.
