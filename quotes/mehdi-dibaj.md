 - For me, life is an opportunity to serve Him, and death is the privilege of getting to be with Him.
 - I would rather have the whole world against me but know that the Almighty God is with me, be called an apostate but know that I have the approval of the God of glory.
 - Men choose a religion, but a Christian is chosen by Jesus Christ.
 - What a privilege to live for our Lord and to die for Him as well.
