 - Nothing is impossible to the willing heart.
 - The world ’s a theatre, the earth a stage, Which God and Nature do with actors fill.
 - Seven cities warred for Homer, being dead, Who, living, had no roof to shroud his head.
 - Then marriage may be said to be past in all quietnesse, when the wife is blind, and the husband deafe.
 - Content’s a kingdom, and I wear that crown.
 - That Time could turn up his swift sandy glass, To untell the days.
