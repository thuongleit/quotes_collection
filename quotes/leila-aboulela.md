 - The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, said, When Allah loves a people, He tries them.
 - Control yourself, it is not worth it. You will regret your rudeness afterwards, your sensitive nature will be troubled.
 - All through life there were distinctions – toilets for men, toilets for women; clothes for men, clothes for women – then, at the end, the graves are identical.
 - The sweetest things in life were not necessarily what one strove for and grabbed. Instead, many many times the All-Merciful, the All-Generous would give His servants without being petitioned, without waiting to be asked.
 - I must settle for freedom in this modern time.
 - I wanted to be good but I wasn’t sure if I was prepared.
