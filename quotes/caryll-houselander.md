 - There is no way of learning of God except through the adventure of our own heart.
 - We are only syllables of the perfect Word.
 - We are united to Him, we are one, and it is when His Passion becomes real to us, through experience and love, that we grow aware of His presence in us.
 - We are the mediocre, we are the half givers, we are the half lovers, we are the savourless salt. Break the hard crust of complacency. Quicken in us the sharp grace of desire.
 - The sense of the joy in anything is the sense of Christ.
 - Christ asks for a home in your soul, where he can be at rest with you, where he can talk easily to you, where you and he, alone together, can laugh and be silent and be delighted with one another.
 - God speaks silently, God speaks in your heart; if your heart is noisy, chattering, you will not hear.
 - Most people know the sheer wonder that goes with falling in love, how not only does everything in heaven and earth become new, but the lover himself becomes new. It is literally like the sap rising in the tree, putting forth new green shoots of life.
 - Powerful to alleviate, to delay, to camouflage, though money is, in the end it lets us down.
 - The love for material things grows like a fungus in the soul and destroys the loveliness of the human heart utterly.
 - The way to begin healing the wounds of the world is to treasure the Infant Christ in us; to be not the castle but the cradle of Christ; and, in rocking that cradle to the rhythm of love, to swing the whole world back into the beat of the Music of Eternal Life.
 - God is everywhere: yes, but how dim faith is, what a remote idea heaven is, in the modern world!
