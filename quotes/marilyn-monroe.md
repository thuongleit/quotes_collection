 - You never know what life is like, until you have lived it.
 - We should all start to live before we get too old. Fear is stupid. So are regrets.
 - I am good, but not an angel. I do sin, but I am not the devil. I am just a small girl in a big world trying to find someone to love.
 - I believe that everything happens for a reason. People change so that you can learn to let go, things go wrong so that you appreciate them when they’re right, you believe lies so you eventually learn to trust no one but yourself, and sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.

 - I said pour yourself a drink, put on some lipstick, and pull yourself together.

 - I used to think as I looked out on the Hollywood night – there must be thousands of girls sitting alone like me, dreaming of becoming a movie star. But I’m not going to worry about them. I’m dreaming the hardest.

 - There is nothing positive about being fat. And there is nothing positive about loving yourself. We all need to conform to society’s expectations of who we are, because if we don’t, who will? Life is more enjoyable when you are thin and pretty. I was never fat a day in my life and I never will.

 - You’re always running into people’s unconscious.
 - I want to say to the people, if I am a star, the people made me a star. No studio, no person, but the people did.

 - I believe in everything – a little bit.

 - In life, we weep at the thought of death. In death, perhaps we weep at the thought of life.
 - Only parts of us will ever touch only parts of others.

 - I think cheesecake helps call attention to you. Then you can follow through and prove yourself.
 - As far as I can make out, women’s friendships with each other are based on a gush of lies and pretty speeches that mean nothing. You’d think they were all wolves trying to seduce each other the way they flatter and flirt when they’re together.
 - All my stepchildren carried the burden of my fame. Sometimes they would read terrible things about me, and I’d worry about whether it would hurt them. I would tell them: ‘Don’t hide these things from me. I’d rather you ask me these things straight out, and I’ll answer all your questions.’
 - My marriage didn’t make me sad, but it didn’t make me happy either. My husband and I hardly spoke to each other. This wasn’t because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom.
 - I won’t be satisfied until people want to hear me sing without looking at me. Of course, that doesn’t mean I want them to stop looking.
 - Hollywood is a place where they’ll pay you a thousand dollars for a kiss and fifty cents for your soul. I know, because I turned down the first offer often enough and held out for the fifty cents.
 - The outside world wants me to have glamour; my fans want me glamorous. I won’t let them down.

 - Do not ever go back to that from which decided to leave. As much as you did not ask, and how would you not want to own. Having conquered a mountain, begin to attack the other.
 - But chiefly, no lies! No lies about there being a Santa Claus or about the world being full of noble and honorable people all eager to help each other and do good to each other. I’ll tell her there are honor and goodness in the world, the same as there are diamonds and radium.
 - If marriage were only bed, we could have made it.
 - If there is only one thing in my life that I am proud of, it’s that I’ve never been a kept woman.
 - As of today, I have absolutely no regrets. I think I am a mature person who can take things in stride. I’m grateful for people in my past. They helped me get to where I am, wherever that is. But now, I am thinking for myself and sitting in on all the business transactions.

 - The more I think of it, the more I realize there are no answers. Life is to be lived.
 - Personally, I react to Marlon Brando. He’s a favorite of mine.
 - People respect you because they feel you’ve survived hard times and endured, and although you’ve become famous, you haven’t become phony.
 - People always ask me if I believe diamonds are a girl’s best friend. Frankly, I don’t.
 - Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you’d never complete your life, would you? You’d never wholly know you.
 - I love to do the things the censors won’t pass.
 - A man has a tendency to accept you the way you are, while most women immediately start to pick flaws and want to change you.
 - Everybody says I can’t act. They said the same thing about Elizabeth Taylor. And they were wrong. She was great in A Place in the Sun. I’ll never get the right part, anything I really want. My looks are against me. They’re too specific.
 - I don’t understand why people aren’t a little more generous with each other.
 - Dating a new man is like holding a strawberry milkshake; first the taste, then the pleasure.
 - Dogs have never hurt me. Only men have.
 - Nights are not just for sleep.
 - There was my name up in lights. I said, ‘God, somebody’s made a mistake.’ But there it was, in lights. And I sat there and said, ‘Remember, you’re not a star.’ Yet there it was up in lights.
 - Fame is fickle, and I know it. It has its compensations but it also has its drawbacks, and I’ve experienced them both.
 - Maybe I’ll never be able to do what I hope to, but at least I have hope.

 - It’s nice to be included in people’s fantasies but you also like to be accepted for your own sake.
 - I keep my undies in the icebox!

 - Next to my husband, and along with Marlon Brando, I think that Yves Montand is the most attractive man I’ve ever met.
 - I don’t think sun-tanned skin is any more attractive than white skin, or any healthier, for that matter.
 - When it gets hot like this, you know what I do? I keep my undies in the ice box.
 - People had a habit of looking at me as if I were some kind of mirror instead of a person. They didn’t see me, they saw their own lewd thoughts, then they white-masked themselves by calling me the lewd one.
 - I’m one of the world’s most self-conscious people. I really have to struggle.
 - I like to feel blonde all over.
 - Millions of people live their entire lives without finding themselves. But it is something I must do.
 - To put it bluntly, I seem to have a whole superstructure with no foundation. But I’m working on the foundation.
 - The body is meant to be seen, not all covered up.
 - My illusions didn’t have anything to do with being a fine actress. I knew how third rate I was. I could actually feel my lack of talent, as if it were cheap clothes I was wearing inside. But, my God, how I wanted to learn, to change, to improve!
 - Creativity starts with humanity when were being human we feel – joys, sadness, when we’re sick, when we’re nervous.
 - I’m personally opposed to a deep tan because I like to feel blond all over.

 - Husbands are chiefly good as lovers when they are betraying their wives.
 - I’m a failure as a woman. My men expect so much of me, because of the image they’ve made of me- and that I’ve made of myself- as a sex symbol. They expect bells to ring and whistles to whistle, but my anatomy is the same as any other woman’s and I can’t live up to it.
 - I’ve never liked the name Marilyn. I’ve often wished that I had held out that day for Jean Monroe. But I guess it’s too late to do anything about it now.
 - I want to be an artist, not an erotic freak. I don’t want to be sold to the public as a celluloid aphrodisiac.
 - I finally made up my mind I wanted to be an actress and I was not going to let my lack of confidence ruin my chances.
 - Men are climbing to the moon, but they don’t seem interested in the beating human heart.
 - Yes, there was something special about me, and I knew what it was. I was the kind of girl they found dead in a hall bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand.
 - Nearly everyone I knew talked to me about God. They always warned me not to offend Him.
 - Always admired men who had many women. It must be that to a child of a dissatisfied woman the idea of monogamy is hollow.
 - If you spend your life competing with business men, what do you have? A bank account and ulcers!
 - I have never been able to wear pajamas or creepy nightgowns; they disturb my sleep.
 - Anything’s possible, almost.
 - Sometimes I feel my whole life has been one big rejection.
 - I have too much imagination to be a housewife.
 - Girdles and wire stays should have never been invented. No man wants to hug a padded bird cage.
 - My public is growing up just as I am. After all, I’m not 19 anymore and if I stick with the sex bit, who will be paying to see me when I’m 50?
 - Being a movie star was never as much fun as dreaming of being one.
 - The truth is, I’ve never fooled anyone. I’ve let men sometimes fool themselves.
 - Trying to build myself up with the fact that I have done things right that were even good and have had moments that were excellent but the bad is heavier to carry around and feel have no confidence.
 - I’ve often stood silent at a party for hours listening to my movie idols turn into dull and little people.
 - I think I made his back feel better.
 - Of course, it does depend on the people, but sometimes I’m invited places to kind of brighten up a dinner table like a musician who’ll play the piano after dinner, and I know you’re not really invited for yourself. You’re just an ornament.

 - I don’t look at myself as a commodity, but I’m sure a lot of people have.
 - In Hollywood a girl’s virtue is much less important than her hairdo.
 - Dreaming about being an actress, is more exciting then being one.
 - The chief drawback with men is that they are too talkative.
 - An actor is supposed to be a sensitive instrument. Isaac Stern takes good care of his violin. What if everybody jumped on his violin?
 - Jewish men don’t know anything.
 - Black men don’t like to be called ‘boys,’ but women accept being called ‘girls.’
 - I had to use my wits or else I’d have been sunk – and nothings going to sink me. Everyone was always pulling at me, tugging at me, as if they wanted a piece of me. It was always, ‘do this, do that,’ and not just on the job but off, too. God, I’ve tried to stay intact, whole.
 - I was never used to being happy, so that wasn’t something I ever took for granted.
 - I want the world to see my body.
 - If I’m a star, then the people made me a star.
 - I hear you’re looking for a sexy blonde to play with the Marx Brothers. Would you like to see me. I’m blonde and I’m sexy.
 - Sometimes I’ve been to a party where no one spoke to me for a whole evening. The men, frightened by their wives or sweeties, would give me a wide berth. And the ladies would gang up in a corner to discuss my dangerous character.
 - Speaking of Oscars, I would win overwhelmingly if the Academy gave an Oscar for faking orgasms. I have done some of my best acting convincing my partners I was in the throes of ecstasy.
 - I don’t consider myself an intellectual. And this is not one of my aims. But I admire intellectual people.
 - A sex-symbol becomes a thing, I just hate being a thing. But if I’m going to be a symbol of something I’d rather have it sex than some other things we’ve got symbols of.
 - First, I’m trying to prove to myself that I’m a person. Then maybe I’ll convince myself that I’m an actress.
 - I have always had a talent for irritating women since I was fourteen.
 - Acting became more than a profession to me. It became a sort of religion.
 - There is just no comparison between having a dinner date with a man and staying home playing canasta with the girls.
 - Squeezing yourself to ooze out the last ounce of sex allure is terribly hard. I’d like to do roles like Julie in Bury the Dead, Gretchen in Faust and Teresa in Cradle Song.
 - I always have a full-length mirror next to the camera when I’m doing publicity stills. That way, I know how I look.
 - I’ll think I have a few wonderful friends and all of a sudden, ooh, here it comes. They do a lot of things. They talk about you to the press, to their friends, tell stories, and you know, it’s disappointing.
 - Everyones childhood plays itself out. No wonder no one knows the other or can completely understand.
 - Nothing’s ever easy as long as you go on living.
 - Someone said to me, ‘If fifty percent of the experts in Hollywood said you had no talent and should give up, what would you do?’ My answer was then and still is, ‘If a hundred percent told me that, all one hundred percent would be wrong.’
 - What good am I? I can’t have kids. I can’t cook. I’ve been divorced three times. Who would want me?
 - Being a sex symbol is a heavy load to carry, especially when one is tired, hurt and bewildered.
 - I never wanted to be Marilyn – it just happened. Marilyn’s like a veil I wear over Norma Jeane.
 - I’ve found men are less likely to let petty things annoy them.
 - I have been told my eating habits are absolutely bizarre. But I don’t think so.
 - Gee, I never thought I had an effect on people until I was in Korea.
 - I used to get the feeling, and sometimes I still get it, that I was fooling somebody – I don’t know who or what – maybe myself. I have feelings some days where there are scenes with a lot of responsibility, and I’ll wish, ‘Gee, if only I had been a cleaning woman.’
 - I love a natural look in pictures.
 - I don’t want to play sex roles any more. I’m tired of being known as the girl with the shape.
 - Consider the fellow. He never spends his time telling you about his previous night’s date. You get the idea he has eyes only for you and wouldn’t think of looking at another woman.
 - I often wake up in the night, and I like to have something to think about.
 - Men love you more if they can be made a little uncertain about owning you.
 - I don’t digest things with my mind.
 - Like any creative human being, I would like a bit more control so that it would be a little easier for me when the director says, ‘One tear, right now,’ that one tear would pop out.
 - After all, all we demanded was a right to twinkle.
 - It’s better to be angry without paying for gold than to be angry after you paid.
 - The only thing a star asks is to be allowed to twinkle.
 - It stirs up envy, fame does.
 - The public doesn’t mind people living together without being married, providing they don’t overdo it.
 - I was brought up differently than the average American child because the average child is brought up expecting to be happy.
 - I have evolved my own exercises, for the muscles I wish to keep firm, and I know they are right for me because I can feel them putting the proper muscles into play as I exercise.
 - The studio people want me to do “Good-bye Charlie” for the movies, but I’m not going to do it. I don’t like the idea of playing a man in a woman’s body – you know? It just doesn’t seem feminine.
 - I have always felt comfortable in blue jeans. I have found it interesting, however, that people also whistle at blue jeans. I have to admit that I like mine to fit. There’s nothing I hate worse than baggy blue jeans.
 - There is a need for aloneness, which I don’t think most people realise for an actor. It’s almost having certain kinds of secrets for yourself that you’ll let the whole world in on only for a moment, when you’re acting. But everybody is always tugging at you. They’d all like sort of a chunk of you.
 - There isn’t anybody that looks like me without clothes on.
 - I think every human being knows how to hate. Because if they didn’t know how to hate how to hate they wouldn’t know how to love.
 - I’ve always wanted a baby.
 - I learned to walk when I was ten months old and I’ve been walking this way ever since.
 - I love a natural look in pictures. I like people with a feeling one way or another – it shows an inner life. I like to see that there’s something going on inside them.
 - I just got to feel that whoever I marry has some real regard for me.
 - It stirs up envy, fame does. People feel fame gives them some kind of privilege to walk up to you and say anything to you – and it won’t hurt your feelings – like it’s happening to your clothing.
 - A man makes you feel important – makes you glad you are a woman.
