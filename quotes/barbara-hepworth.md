 - I am the form and I am the hollow, the thrust and the contour.
 - I rarely draw what I see. I draw what I feel in my body.
 - The United Nations is our conscience. If it succeeds it is our success. If it fails it is our failure.
 - My left hand is my thinking hand. The right is only a motor hand. This holds the hammer. The left hand, the thinking hand, must be relaxed, sensitive. The rhythms of thought pass through the fingers and grip of this hand into the stone.
