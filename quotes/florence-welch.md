 - If you do something with your whole heart and it’s a mistake, you can live with that.
 - Having a soul, they say, is like taking sadness and turning it into something beautiful.
 - I wanted to be a witch when I was a kid. I was obsessed with witchcraft. At school, me and my two friends had these spell books; I always wanted a more magical reality. I had a little shrine at home and I did a spell to try and make the boy in the other class fall in love with me.
 - My style of playing is more enthusiasm and instinct than skill.
 - I’m completely in love with the world but also terrified of it. It creates some overwhelming feelings. Wanting to battle out that joy and fear is part of my music.

 - I’m a choir girl gone horribly, desperately wrong.
 - I was always that girl growing up who you could find dancing down supermarket aisles. It’s that sense of not feeling inhibited. Dancing in supermarkets is my favorite thing.
 - It’s always darkness before the dawn.
 - I definitely have a real self-destructive streak.
 - I can’t wait to get on stage, because there you don’t worry about whether you’ll ever get married because your life is insane, or whether you’ll ever have another boyfriend again, you don’t worry about the typical boundaries of how your life has to be.
 - I’ve been having this really weird anxiety dream about arriving too late or too early, and the people in charge are like, ‘You have to leave! You have to go back to the hotel and get ready!’ And I use the wrong exit, and I’m running down the red carpet in pyjamas, like, ‘No! Don’t look at me!’

 - Hands up if you’re ready to do something you’ll regret this weekend. Go forth! You have my blessing.
 - I tend to lose myself in the moment. I’m not very good at holding back. I don’t know how to do this without feeling everything. My emotions are the tool I use to perform.
 - I can’t just have one painting – I need to cover the wall in paintings. It’s the same with my music. I want to mix everything together to create more.

 - I got to live out my 11-year-old fantasies – I got to go on stage with Green Day. Billie Joe called my name from the stage. ‘Dookie’ was the first album I ever bought. I covered the whole of ‘Nimrod’ and he’d heard it. That was like the 11-year-old girl dreamed.

 - The only music I was listening to for ages was old soul. So I wasn’t listening to a lot of new music – especially indie music.

 - If you see a river running smoothly, it’s because someone has drowned in it, and if it’s raging, it means that it’s still got bloodlust.
 - When you’re heartbroken, you’re at your most creative – you have to channel all your energies into something else to not think about it. Contentment is a creativity killer, but don’t worry – I’m very capable of making myself discontented.
 - During the songs, you transcend yourself. The best way to be in the performance is to be without pause and be essentially in the moment, in that moment of expression.
 - For me, ‘Dog Days’ symbolizes apocalyptic euphoria, chaotic freedom and running really, really fast with your eyes closed.
 - I feel things in quite an intense way. I’m not actually the most intense person.

 - On stage, you can use your emotions. It’s the place where you can channel them. They have a purpose.
 - There’s such an extreme feeling to be in love, especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship, where you’re both kind of really bad for each other, but you love each other so much. Those extreme emotions, I think, can only be described with extreme imagery.
 - I’ve always been able to just concoct a melody quite easily – it’s just kind of instinct, really. You’ve got to channel your subconscious.

 - I’ve built my wardrobe color palette around red, so I’m happy with it, but I do get pangs when I see beautiful brunettes. I’ve already been blue, green, black, and blonde.
 - For someone so conflicted, who am I to give advice to anybody? It’s such a funny, grandiose idea.
 - I like the idea of taking off like a bird.

 - I dyed my hair red when I was ten and when I was 11 – in my goth period – I dyed it black and I was really into witchcraft. I made mini shrines in my bedroom with candles and tried to cast spells to make the boy in the next class fall in love with me. I don’t think he did.
 - The stage is a place where I can be wholly myself. Even though you’re in front of people almost to be judged, it is a place without judgement.
 - Music to me is so internal. It’s physical and it’s emotional. Whereas fashion is so much about the external that it’s almost like a break. It’s not inner turmoil. It’s total escapism.

 - It’s good to be vulnerable in amongst the grandeur; you shouldn’t lose that sense of intimacy and vulnerability with people.
 - But I was always much more interested in reading fashion magazines than I was music magazines when I was a teenager. Just that sense of romanticism and escapism and the dream of it has always been quite alluring to me, as well as that sense of becoming a character through clothes.
 - Where’s my heart at? Aw. Um, in my chest. I think it’s in there – on the right hand side. Sometimes it’s in my mouth and sometimes I can feel it in my stomach, when I get really nervous. So it’s pretty physical.
 - I can’t worry too much about the everyday things. Otherwise I’d lose touch with my own world, that helps me as an artist, but it’s frustrating for the people around me. I’m vaguely functional, but there’s always something slightly off.
 - I’ve got my ideal job. I like to sing, I like to dance, I like to bang drums and dress up, and someone pays me – it’s incredible.

 - I always wanted to sound like a man, like Jeff Buckley or Tom Waits.
 - The release of ‘Lungs’ was so hard. It was terrifying, because it was the first time doing everything. The first experiences of media exposure were almost paralysing. I spent a lot of time crying on the floor of the studio – it sent me a bit mad.
 - I like to wear clothes that I will wear when I am an old lady.
 - Well, I’m completely normal and mellow.

 - I get in fights with my sister all the time. She comes on the road with me and we fight – like sisters do.
 - I didn’t want to become a personality, I wanted to be a musician, but because I didn’t have an album to stand by yet it was hard for people to see that. But now, two albums in, I’m happy with things.

 - I guess in order to say something to one person, I have to sing it to a couple of thousand. It doesn’t make for healthy relationships.
 - Growing up, I always wanted to be in punk bands, so I’m really enjoying the harder, heavier element. It’s always been my dream to have people moshing at my gig, kind of that really feral element of the music coming out more. I love crowd-surfing.

 - I used to dress like an eight-year-old boy. Traveling has inspired me to be more experimental.

 - Touring, and being in a band, it’s almost like the other stuff, the other parts of life, get put on hold.
 - I saw ‘The Artist.’ It’s really beautiful and it’s all done to the letter with all the silent film techniques. The costumes were amazing and the dog is so good.
 - I’m one of those people that is up for most things. When I was offered to sing at the Oscars I was like, ‘Yeah, I want to know what that’s like!’ I’m always curious to know what things are like – as long as you’re not compromising who you are.
