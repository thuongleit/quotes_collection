 - The world is a complex, interconnected, finite, ecological-social-psychological-economic system. We treat it as if it were not, as if it were divisible, separable, simple, and infinite. Our persistent, intractable global problems arise directly from this mismatch.

 - There is too much bad news to justify complacency. There is too much good news to justify despair.
 - You may be able to fool the voters, but not the atmosphere.
 - We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!
 - No one can define or measure justice, democracy, security, freedom, truth, or love. No one can define or measure any value.

 - A good leader sets the right goals, gets things moving, and helps us to discover that we already know what to do.
 - The actions of my government are not bearable. They devastate our natural resources and deprive our people. The politicians speak piously while practicing greed and divisiveness; they care nothing for the nation. I want to do more than withdraw my support. I want to tar and feather them.

 - Since the Earth is finite, and we will have to stop expanding sometime, should we do it before or after nature’s diversity is gone?
 - You should issue demerits for tree cutting or the destruction of humus.
 - How do we appreciate the good without letting it be the enemy of the perfect? How do we keep a step in the right direction from becoming a stopping point? How do we get beyond shades of insipid light green?
 - Any system, biological, economic, or social, that gets so encrusted that it cannot self-evolve, a system that systematically scorns experimentation and wipes out the raw material of innovation, is doomed over the long term on this highly variable planet.
