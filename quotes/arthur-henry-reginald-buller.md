 - There was a young lady named Bright, Whose speed was far faster than light; She set out one day In a relative way, And returned on the previous night.
 - To her friends said the Bright one in chatter, “I have learned something new about matter: My speed was so great, Much increased was my weight, Yet I failed to become any fatter!”
