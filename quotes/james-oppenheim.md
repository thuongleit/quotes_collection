 - The foolish man seeks happiness in the distance; the wise grows it under his feet.
 - Hearts starve as well as bodies; give us bread, but give us roses.
 - Man’s the bad child of the universe.
 - Free men set themselves free.
 - A faith like Lincoln’s would transform the world!
 - Would you end war? Create great Peace.
