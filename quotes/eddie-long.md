 - We like foreplay with God, but we make sure we have our spiritual contraceptives on! Cause we don’t want to conceive nothing.
 - I’m not leaving you if you don’t leave me.
 - You can’t undo yesterday, you can work on today, tomorrow, you will wonder how you screwed up 2 days in a row.
 - The doctor can X-Ray you and say, ‘You got cancer.’ And then you go home and God let me see, does Christ have cancer? If Christ don’t, I don’t have cancer. All I need to do is get a picture of what he looks like. Because, if I can see Him I become like Him.
 - We go to church buildings that still have a mortgage. Which means the bank owns God’s house. Which means that we go and make love to God in a house that Satan owns!
