 - People are not killed by earthquakes alone, but by collapsed buildings.
 - I’m not inventing anything new, I’m just using existing material differently.
 - I believe that the material doesn’t need to be strong to be used to build a strong structure. The strength of the structure has nothing to do with strength of the material.
 - An architect does not need to spend his whole career making monuments for rich people.
 - Architecture is not about designing somehting from a free, fanciful idea. It is about discovering and establishing one’s own principle, some kind of regularity – finding an individual formula to apply to one’s buildings.
 - Everyone used to want to be star architects. That’s no longer the case.
