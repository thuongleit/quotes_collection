 - I hope Gunter Grass will continue helping the SPD in campaigns and that he will otherwise remain with us as a provocative literary figure, as well.
 - We will fight against any pro-nuclear power plan. And we will remind people that a change in the German nuclear consensus would stifle the development of sustainable energy and it would cost jobs. The SPD is the strongest among the opposition parties and we must take on this role with vigour.
 - Besides Germany, the only countries that don’t have speed limits are places like Nepal, where road conditions are so bad that a limit would be beside the point. In other words, it’s a little crazy that this is even a topic for debate in Germany.
