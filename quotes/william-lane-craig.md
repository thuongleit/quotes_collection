 - If you’re sincerely seeking God, God will make His existence evident to you.
 - It’s no longer enough to teach our children Bible stories; they need doctrine and apologetics.
 - Reason is a tool to help us better understand and defend our faith; as Anselm put it, ours is a faith that seeks understanding.
 - Faith is trust or commitment to what you think is true.
 - The Christian faith does not call for us to put our minds on the shelf, to fly in the face of common sense and history, or to make a leap of faith into the dark. The rational person, fully apprised of the evidence, can confidently believe...
 - The person who follows the pursuit of reason unflinchingly toward its end will be atheistic or, at best, agnostic.
 - Part of the broader task of Christian scholarship is to help create and sustain a cultural milieu in which the gospel can be heard as an intellectually viable option for thinking men and women.
 - Certainty is an unrealistic and unattainable ideal.
