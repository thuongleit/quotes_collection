 - Like Leibniz’s possible worlds, most men are only equally entitled pretenders to existence. There are few existences.
 - Original love never appears in pure form, but in manifold veils and shapes, such as confidence, humility, reverence, serenity, asfaithfulness and modesty, as gratefulness; but primarily as longing and wistful melancholy.

 - The subject of history is the gradual realization of all that is practically necessary.
 - Aphorisms are the true form of the universal philosophy.
 - Only through religion can logic develop into philosophy, only from this source stems that which makes philosophy more than science. And without religion we will have only novels, or the triviality today called belles lettres instead of an eternally rich and infinite poetry.
 - Set religion free, and a new humanity will begin.
 - Versatility of education can be found in our best poetry, but the depth of mankind should be found in the philosopher.
 - Reason is mechanical, wit chemical, and genius organic spirit.
 - There is no self-knowledge but an historical one. No one knows what he himself is who does not know his fellow men, especially the most prominent one of the community, the master’s master, the genius of the age.
 - Wit as an instrument of revenge is as infamous as art is as a means of sensual titillation.
 - The symmetry and organization of history teaches us that mankind, during its existence and development, genuinely was and became an individual, a person. In this great personality of mankind, God became man.
 - The history of imitation of the older literature, particularly abroad, has among other advantages this one, that the important concepts of unintentional parody and passive wit can be deduced from it most easily and comprehensively.
 - A family can develop only with a loving woman as its center.
 - The whole history of modern poetry is a continuous commentary on the short text of philosophy: every art should become science, and every science should become art; poetry and philosophy should be united.
 - There are three kinds of explanation in science: explanations which throw a light upon, or give a hint at a matter; explanations which do not explain anything; and explanations which obscure everything.
 - Without poetry, religion becomes obscure, false, and malignant; without philosophy, licentious in all wantonness, and lascivious to the point of self-castration.
 - What is called good society is usually nothing but a mosaic of polished caricatures.
 - Both in their origins and effects, boredom and stuffy air resemble each other. They are usually generated whenever a large number of people gather together in a closed room.
 - Wit is the appearance, the external flash of imagination. Thus its divinity, and the witty character of mysticism.
 - In the ancients, one sees the accomplished letter of entire poetry: in the moderns, one has the presentiment of the spirit in becoming.
 - Every form of life is in its origin not natural, but divine and human; for it must spring from love, just as there can be no reason without spirit.
 - When reason and unreason come into contact, an electrical shock occurs. This is called polemics.
 - Separate religion from morality, and you have the true energy for evil within man, the terrible, cruel, devastating, and inhuman principle which naturally lies in his spirit. Here the division of the indivisible punishes itself most awfully.
 - Genius is, to be sure, not a matter of arbitrariness, but rather of freedom, just as wit, love, and faith, which once shall become arts and disciplines. We should demand genius from everybody, without, however, expecting it.

 - What is lost in the good or excellent translation is precisely the best.
 - Every relationship of man to the infinite is religion, namely of a man in the full abundance of his humanity. Whenever a mathematician calculates infinity, that, to be sure, is not religion. Infinity conceived in this abundance is the Godhead.

 - Religion is absolutely unfathomable. Always and everywhere one can dig more deeply into infinities.
 - The naive is what is or appears to be natural, individual, or classical to the point of irony or to the point of continuous alternation of self-creation and self-destruction. If it is only instinct, then it is childlike, childish, or silly; if it is only intention, it becomes affectation.
 - Every good man progressively becomes God. To become God, to be man, and to educate oneself, are expressions that are synonymous.
 - All men are somewhat ridiculous and grotesque, just because they are men; and in this respect artists might well be regarded as man multiplied by two. So it is, was, and shall be.
 - Philosophy is the true home of irony, which might be defined as logical beauty: for wherever men are philosophizing in spoken or written dialogues, and provided they are not entirely systematic, irony ought to be produced and postulated; even the Stoics regarded urbanity as a virtue.
 - God is each truly and exalted thing, therefore the individual himself to the highest degree. But are not nature and the world individuals?
 - Religion is not only a part of education, an element of humanity, but the center of everything else, always the first and the ultimate, the absolutely original.

 - The need to raise itself above humanity is humanity’s main characteristic.
 - In true prose everything must be underlined.
 - Gracefulness is a correct life: sensuality which contemplates and forms itself.

 - Man is free whenever he produces or manifests God, and through this he becomes immortal.
 - Religion can emerge in all forms of feeling: here wild anger, there the sweetest pain; here consuming hatred, there the childlike smile of serene humility.

 - A critic is a reader who ruminates. Thus, he should have more than one stomach.

 - Just as a child is really a thing that wants to become a man, so is the poem an object of nature that wants to become an object ofart.
 - There is so much poetry, and yet nothing is more rare than a poetic work. This is what the masses make out of poetical sketches, studies, aphorisms, trends, ruins, and raw material.
 - The life and vigor of poetry consists of the fact that it steps out of itself, tears out a section of religion, then withdraws into itself to assimilate it. The same is true of philosophy.
 - In the world of language, or in other words in the world of art and liberal education, religion necessarily appears as mythology or as Bible.
 - God the father, and even more often the devil himself, appears at times in the place of fate in the modern tragedy. Why is it thatthis has not induced any scholar to develop a theory of the diabolical genre?

 - Poetry and philosophy are, according to how you take them, different spheres, different forms, or factors of religion. Try to really combine both, and you will have nothing but religion.
 - The historian is a prophet looking backward.
 - Kant introduced the concept of the negative into philosophy. Would it not also be worthwhile to try to introduce the concept of the positive into philosophy?
 - It is individuality which is the original and eternal within man; personality doesn’t matter so much. To pursue the education anddevelopment of this individuality as one’s highest vocation would be a divine egoism.
