 - A Tribe Called Quest music was so inclusive, so conscious, it brought such a community together.
 - I love my kids, and the moments I have with them, and it’s kind of weird, it’s such an age old cliche, but the way that my sons, the way they make me feel when I look at them, the way they say things, no one else would probably react to them, but it’s a special thing for me.

 - The thing about New York is you can leave your house without a plan and find the day. You can’t do that in Los Angeles. You need to get in your car, all this, you can’t just drive around like a lunatic. In New York, you can literally walk outside, and wind up anywhere.
 - I grew up in New York City in the ’80s, and it was the epicenter of hip-hop. There was no Internet. Cable television wasn’t as broad. I would listen to the radio, hear cars pass by playing a song, or tape songs off of the radio. At that time, there was such an excitement around hip-hop music.
 - So to compare the Beatles, obviously the Beatles are the Beatles, but in hip-hop terms, Tribe is the Beatles. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five are the Beatles. Big Daddy Kane is Jimi Hendrix. It means that much to people that grew up with it.
