 - Mindfulness gives you time. Time gives you choices. Choices, skillfully made, lead to freedom. You don’t have to be swept away by your feeling. You can respond with wisdom and kindness rather than habit and reactivity.
 - View all problems as challenges. Look upon negativities that arise as opportunities to learn and to grow. Don’t run from them, condemn yourself, or bury your burden in saintly silence. You have a problem? Great. More grist for the mill. Rejoice, dive in, and investigate.
 - But look within and watch the stuff coming up-restlessness, anxiety, impatience, pain-just watch it come up and don’t get involved. Much to your surprise, it will simply go away. It rises, it passes away. As simple as that. There is another word for self-discipline. It is patience.
 - When you have learned compassion for yourself, compassion for others is automatic.
 - Ignorance may be bliss, but it does not lead to liberation.
 - You can only have bliss if you don’t chase it.
 - The principal cause of suffering is craving. Once craving is eliminated, much suffering will be eliminated. Still more suffering will be eliminated once ignorance is eliminated. Both craving and ignorance are equally powerful defilements that cause suffering.
 - Don’t cling to anything and don’t reject anything.
 - Meditation changes your character.
 - No problem. You are not crazier than you were yesterday. It has always been this way, and you just never noticed.

 - Watch the functioning of your own mind in a calm and detached manner so you can gain insight into your own behavior.
 - The purpose of meditation is personal transformation.
 - Discipline is a difficult word for most of us. It conjures up images of somebody standing over you with a stick, telling you that you’re wrong. But self-discipline is different. It’s the skill of seeing through the hollow shouting of your own impulses and piercing their secret.
 - The brain does not manufacture thoughts unless we stimulate it with habitual verbalizing. When we train ourselves by constant practice to stop verbalizing, the brain can experience things as they are.
 - Whatever attitudes we habitually use toward ourselves, we will use on others, and whatever attitudes we habitually use toward others, we will use on ourselves.
 - The process of becoming who you will be begins first with the total acceptance of who you are.
 - The present moment is changing so fast that we often do not notice its existence at all. Every moment of mind is like a series of pictures passing through a projector. Some of the pictures come from sense impressions. Others come from memories of past experiences or from fantasies of the future.
 - You can learn not to want what you want, to recognize desires but not be controlled by them.
 - Let come what comes, and accommodate yourself to that, whatever it is. If good mental images arise, that is fine. If bad mental images arise, that is fine, too. Look on all of it as equal, and make yourself comfortable with whatever happens.
 - Civilization changes man on the outside. Meditation softens him within, through and through.

 - Peace is not a thought, not a concept; it is a nonverbal experience.
 - Each step along the Buddha’s path to happiness requires practising mindfulness until it becomes part of your daily life.
 - Mindfulness helps us freeze the frame so that we can become aware of our sensations and experiences as they are, without the distorting coloration of socially conditioned responses or habitual reactions.
 - The you that goes in one side of the meditation experience is not the same you that comes out the other side.
 - We have to learn to be kind to ourselves. In the long run avoiding unpleasantness is a very unkind thing to do to yourself.
