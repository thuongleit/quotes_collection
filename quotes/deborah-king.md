 - Civility is the art and act of caring for others.
 - The truth is, you are your own “special someone,” and loving yourself is the first step to finding love outside yourself.
 - I’m also big on journaling. You can write in the sand or on a watermelon or whatever suits you, but the key is to get it out of your head and out of your heart and down your arms and into something, a keyboard or piece of paper.
 - Meditation is like a giant broom for sweeping away any stagnant or blocked energy that you may have buried deep in your body.
 - Unless you’re living in your truth, you’re slowly killing yourself.
 - We all need time to enjoy being alive without an agenda of getting something done.
 - Every woman knows the power of the sacred feminine.
 - I urge people to get in touch with how you really feel, and don’t lie to yourself. Absolutely don’t. You may not necessarily be able to change something right now, but you need to know how you really feel.
 - Write down how you really feel, not how you wish you felt or how you think you should feel, but how you really feel. Don’t try to change it. Honor it: “This is how I feel.” Express it, and then it’s not suppressed and stored somewhere in your liver or somewhere else.
 - We have a lot of limiting beliefs that we’re not even conscious of. Maybe your family taught you you weren’t good enough or you weren’t smart enough. Perhaps we’re taught that this religion is good and all other religions are bad. It’s endless.
 - The worst lies of all are the ones we tell ourselves. They are the most damaging.
 - One of the first things I do with people is help them figure out what their limiting beliefs are and then encourage them to question, “Well, do I really want to keep that one? Is it limiting me? Does it not fit me? Is it holding me back?”
 - We all have various ways of dropping in and getting connected to ourselves. For one person it might be playing basketball. It’s a good way to get in touch with how they feel. For somebody else, it might be taking a walk.
 - When people tell me they’re trying to meditate, I always know they don’t have a format yet that works. I encourage a real meditative format that you use daily, because meditation is incremental and it only works if done every day.
 - I do find that Western medicine is more and more open to proving energetic concepts. Why not, because modern physics is 100 percent based on it.
 - That’s like buying asparagus and then leaving it at the checkout. Why would you do that?
