 - Why not dream your own wonderful sequels? When you have finished a book, it can go on in your mind, the characters doing just what you want them to do.
 - But some animals, like some men, leave a trail of glory behind them. They give their spirit to the place where they have lived, and remain forever a part of the rocks and streams and the wind and sky.
 - The wind flew. God told to wind to condense itself and out of the flurry came the horse. But with the spark of sprit the horse flew by the wind itself.
 - Machines have about as much warmth as a cube of ice. And that is why the horse is still part of our lives and will live on. He was here millions of years before man came upon the earth, and if the cycle is completed, he may still be thundering across the world long after man has vanished.
