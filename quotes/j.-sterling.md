 - Prove it.
 - Sometimes letting go is the only way to find out who you’re meant to hold on to.
 - There will come a time in your life when you lose something that matters to you. You’ll fight for it and you won’t win. But what really matters isn’t the war you’re waging, it’s that you don’t lose the person you are in the midst of the battle.
 - Sometimes life gets ugly before it gets beautiful.
 - You’re both so screwed up alone that together you’re like the perfect mess.
