 - There is no foreground or background, only a continuity of interlacing relationships.
 - The most beautiful landscape cannot hold my fascinated attention as much as nature by the seaside and all that is connected with water.
 - Where I used to strive for movement and restlessness I now attempt to sense and express the complete total calm of objects and the surrounding air.
 - Each individual work serves as an expression of our most personal state of mind at that particular moment and of the inescapable, imperative need for release by means of an appropriate act of creation: in the rhythm, form, colour and mood of a picture.
