 - The teenage years are ridiculously crucial and hard and, um, awkward.
 - I don’t know if I’ve ever been in a clique. The older I’ve gotten, the more I’ve realized what a true friend really is. So my friendship circle has changed a bit.

 - In general I like a guy who is athletic, somebody who can teach me something. Whether it’s teaching me a new way to cut on a wave or teach me a three-point conversion or teach me how to dribble a soccer ball. There’s something really cool about that.
 - I don’t have a TV at my house. I literally do not. I have a television, but I don’t have anything plugged into it, though. I watch DVDs.
