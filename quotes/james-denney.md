 - The depravity which sin has produced in human nature extends to the whole of it. There is no part of man’s nature which is unaffected by it. Man’s nature is all of a piece, and what affects it at all affects it altogether.
 - In preaching you cannot produce at the same time the impression that you are clever and that Christ is wonderful.
 - The New Testament preaches a Christ who was dead and is alive, not a Christ who was alive and is dead.
 - The Kingdom of Heaven is not for the well-meaning: it is for the desperate.
