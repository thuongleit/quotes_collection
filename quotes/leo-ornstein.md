 - In writing music, the structure of each piece is a very important factor.
 - But in the end, music is ultimately an aural art, pure and simple.
 - Now, what we are not talking about, what you’re really coming to, is what compromises one makes so that the listener understands somewhat of what you’re doing, what you’re trying to express.
 - A person improvising is sometimes very fortunate that just at that second things coincide.
 - You write it down because finally, when it’s written down you do get it out of your system somewhat.
 - We can use techniques in modifying things, in controlling things, but the first impulse has to be something that you simply cannot make just out of technique, or else it becomes perfectly evident that it is nothing but technique that you’re exercising.
 - It doesn’t necessarily mean at all that the composer plays his own works best.
