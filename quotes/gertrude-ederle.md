 - I have no complaints. I am comfortable and satisfied. I am not the kind of person who reaches for the moon as long as I have the stars.
 - I just knew if it could be done, it had to be done, and I did it.
 - People said women couldn’t swim the Channel, but I proved they could.
 - When we’re in the water, we’re not in this world.
 - To me, the sea is like a person – like a child that I’ve known a long time. It sounds crazy, I know, but when I swim in the sea I talk to it. I never feel alone when I’m out there.
 - Slowly I came to know that the depth of our heartbreaks determines the depth of our faith. God gives us everything to conquer the big and the little hurts of life.
