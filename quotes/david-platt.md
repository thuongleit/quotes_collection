 - To be a disciple of Jesus is to make disciples of Jesus.
 - If you can trust God to save you for eternity, you can trust him to lead you for a lifetime.

 - Gospel possession requires gospel proclamation.
 - The most glorious reason you exist is for the proclamation of the glory of God to the ends of the world. And it’s more than having a nice life.
 - Being a member of a church means realizing that we are responsible for helping the brothers and sisters around us to grow as disciples of Jesus. In the same way, they are responsible for helping us. We desperately need each other in the daily fight to follow Christ in a world that’s full of sin.
 - Do we believe the reward found in Jesus is worth the risk of following Him?
 - To be a Christian is to be loved by God, pursued by God, and found by God.
 - To everyone wanting a safe, untroubled, comfortable life free from danger, stay away from Jesus. The danger in our lives will always increase in proportion to the depth of our relationship with Christ.
 - We learned that orphans are easier to ignore before you know their names. They are easier to ignore before you see their faces. It is easier to pretend they’re not real before you hold them in your arms. But once you do, everything changes.
 - A high view of God’s sovereignty fuels death-defying devotion to global missions. Maybe another way to put it, people, and more specifically pastors, who believe that God’s sovereign over all things will lead Christians to die for the sake of all peoples.
 - Don’t underestimate what God can do with ordinary people.
 - Orphans are easier to ignore before you know their names; but once you know, everything changes.
 - When you come to Jesus, you don’t come to get health, wealth and prosperity. You come to Jesus to get Jesus.
 - Surely the greatest social injustice is that 2 billion people haven’t heard of God’s love in Christ.
 - Why make disciples? Because heaven and hell exist, and the end of the world is coming.
 - The more Christ fulfills the cravings of our souls, the more he changes our taste capacities from the inside out. The more we walk with him, the more we want him. The more we taste of him, the more we enjoy him. And this transforms how we live and what we live for.
 - The church is not an audience of spectators; we are a fellowship of disciple-makers.
 - What if the very reason we have breath is because we have been saved for a global mission? And what if anything less than passionate involvement in global mission is actually selling God short by frustrating the very purpose for which he created us?
 - While the goal of the American dream is to make much of us, the goal of the gospel is to make much of God.
 - Give liberally. Go urgently. Live dangerously.
 - The bible informs us, compels us to care for the poor, to love the outcast, to serve the needy.

 - People will never know how glorious the cross is until they know how serious sin is.
 - We have a master who deserves radical sacrifice.
 - Our greatest need is not to try harder. Our greatest need is a new heart.
 - Do you believe that Jesus is worth abandoning everything for? Do you believe him enough to obey him and to follow him wherever he leads, even when the crowds in our culture – maybe even our churches – turn the other way?
 - This is the gospel. The just and loving Creator of the universe has looked upon hopelessly sinful people and sent His Son, God in the flesh, to bear His wrath against sin on the cross and to show His power over sin in the resurrection so that all who trust in Him will be reconciled to God forever.
 - The faith in Christ that saves us from our sins involves an internal transformation that has external implications.

 - If our lives do not reflect radical compassion for the poor, there is reason to wonder if Christ is really in us at all.

 - God has made a way of salvation for the lost. Not a way, but the way. And this is the good news – the gospel.
 - The gospel does not prompt you to mere reflection; the gospel requires a response. In the process of hearing Jesus, you are compelled to take an honest look at your life, your family, and your church and not just ask, ‘What is he saying?’ but also ask, ‘What shall I do?’
 - The road that leads to heaven is risky, lonely, and costly in this world, and few are willing to pay the price. Following Jesus involves losing your life-and finding new life in him.
 - Our great need is to fall before an almighty Father day and night and to plead for him to show his radical power in and through us, enabling us to accomplish for his glory what we could never imagine in our own strength.
 - God’s ultimate concern is not to get you or me from point A to point B along the quickest, easiest, smoothest, clearest route possible. Instead, his ultimate concern is that you and I would know him deeply as we trust him more completely.
 - We owe Christ to the world – to the least person and to the greatest person, to the richest person and to the poorest person, to the best person and to the worst person. We are in debt to the nations.
 - I want to be apart of something that can only be explained by the hand of God!
 - But then I realize there is never going to be a day when I stand before God and He looks at me and says, ‘I wish you would have kept more for yourself.’ I’m confident that God will take care of me.
 - To be a Christian is to realize that in your sin, you were separated from God’s presence, and you deserved nothing but God’s wrath.
 - Privatized faith in a resurrected Christ is practically inconceivable.
 - Satan’s strategies to stop the church will ultimately serve to spread the church. And Satan’s strategies to inflict earthly pain in your life will ultimately serve to increase eternal glory with your God; ‘Light momentary affliction.’
 - May even the concept of unreached peoples be totally intolerable to us.
 - Jesus has not given us options to consider. He has given us commands to obey.
 - If there were 1,000 ways to God we would want 1,001.
 - The gospel confronts us with the hopelessness of our sinful condition. But we don’t like what we see of ourselves in the gospel, so we shrink back from it.
 - People who claim to be Christians while their lives look no different from the rest of the world are clearly not Christians.
 - We desperately need each other in the daily fight to follow Christ in a world that’s full of sin.
 - We are not the end of the gospel; God is.
 - Believing in the Jesus of the Bible makes life risky on a lot of levels because it is absolute surrender of every decision we make, every dollar we spend, our lives belong to another.
 - The gospel beckons our sin-sick souls to simple trust in Christ, the only One who is truly radical enough.
 - The dangerous assumption we unknowingly accept in the American dream is that our greatest asset is our own ability.
 - God uses sorrowful tragedy to set the stage for surprising triumph-whether in this life or the life to come.
 - This is the curse of superficial religion: the constant attempt to do outward things apart from inward transformation.
 - Good intentions, regular worship, Bible study, do not prevent blindness. Part of our sinful nature instinctively chooses to see what we want to see and to ignore what we want to ignore.
 - What if the word of God was enough to inspire passionate worship among his people?
 - God delights in revealing Himself to you when you are bold enough to bother Him. In fact, I think He would say that the only thing that bothers Him is when you don’t come to Him.

 - God has clearly called and gifted some people in the church to teach his Word formally.
 - God blesses his people with extravagant grace so they might extend his extravagant glory to all peoples on the earth.
 - We live in a church culture that has a dangerous tendency to disconnect the grace of God from the glory of God.
 - God’s revelation is in the gospel not only reveals who He is, but it also reveals who we are.
 - This is how God works. He puts people in positions where they are desperate for his power, and then he shows his provision in ways that display his greatness.
 - Christianity is radically different from every other religion in the world.
 - Making disciples by going, baptizing, and teaching people the Word of Christ and then enabling them to do the same thing in other people’s lives – this is the plan God has for each of us to impact nations for the glory of Christ.
 - Instead of trying to conquer sin by working hard to change our actions, we can conquer sin by trusting Christ to change our affections.
 - The journey begins, though, with understanding what it means to be a christian. To say you believe in Jesus apart from conversion in your life completely misses the essence of what it means to follow him. Do not be deceived.
 - We can rest confident in the fact that nothing will happen to us in this world apart from the gracious will of a sovereign God. Nothing.
 - Spiritual deception is dangerous -and damning.
 - Jesus is no longer one to be accepted or invited in but one who is infinitely worthy of our immediate and total surrender.
 - It is impossible to be a follower of Christ while denying, disregarding, discrediting, and disbelieving the words of Christ.
 - Faith is the realization that God’s pleasure in you will never be based upon your performance for him.
 - We have an incomprehensibly great God!
 - We assume that our race simply deserves heaven; that God owes heaven to us unless we do something really bad to warrant otherwise.
 - We don’t go to Scripture for permission to do what we think is best, but for direction to do what He says is best.
 - Should it concern us that the bible never calls us to ask Jesus into our hearts. Should it concern us that the bible never mentions such a superstitious sinners prayer and yet that is exactly what we have sold to so many as salvation.
 - We have a dangerous tendency to misunderstand, minimize, and even manipulate the gospel in order to accommodate our assumptions and our desires.
 - The body of Christ is a multicultural citizenry of an otherworldly kingdom.
 - I am finding deep joy in depending on Christ for the guidance only He can provide as He produces the fruit of gospel in my life.
 - I wonder sometimes, though, if we intentionally or just unknowingly mask the beauty of God in the gospel by minimizing his various attributes.
 - Why not begin operating under the idea that God has given us excess, not so we could have more, but so we could give more?

 - When we consider the promises of Christ, risking everything we are and everything we have for His sake is no longer a matter of sacrifice. It’s just common sense.
 - Salvation has absolutely nothing to do with human merit and absolutely everything to do with divine mercy.
 - Our possessions can be deadly. They can be subtly deadly.
 - We have the audacity to look God in the face and say, ‘No.’
 - Instead of imagining all the things we can accomplish, we ask God to do what only he can accomplish. Yes, we work, we plan, we organize, and we create, but we do it all while we fast, while we pray, and while we constantly confess our need for the provision of God.
 - And as we meet needs on earth, we are proclaiming a gospel that transforms lives for eternity.

 - The Life of Christ determines everything about us.
 - The resources of heaven are ready and waiting for the people of God who desire to make much of him in this world.

 - We act, though, not under a utopian illusion that you or I or anyone or everyone together can rid this world of pain and suffering. That responsibility belongs to the resurrected Christ, and he will do it when he returns. But until that day, we do with an undivided heart whatever God calls us to do.
