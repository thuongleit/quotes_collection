 - When you want something this badly, you don’t just give up. You fight and fight until you absolutely can’t fight anymore.
 - I’ve never felt so heartbroken and so in love at the same time. If you would’ve told me the day we met that you were going to break my heart – and that days, months, or even years would pass, that I would still be hurting like this – it wouldn’t have stopped me from falling in love with you.
 - I want the late-night drives, the sunset watching, the screaming, the yelling, and the crying. I know I’ll definitely want the make-up sex that comes after all of the screaming and crying. I want the good, the bad, and the in-between. All of it is what’s going to make us amazing together.
 - The thought of not seeing your eyes when I wake up, or not hearing your heart next to me while you are asleep made me sick. With all of that, I decided no, I can’t go another day without you. I don’t want to go another day without you.
 - I want to break the rules with you. Kiss you passionately every day. Make you smile when you’re about to cry. I want no regrets with us. I want us to laugh together until we can’t breathe and it hurts. No man will ever love you the way I’m going to love you, Emily. You’re it. My last. My forever.
 - I can’t promise you it’ll always be sweet and tender because you and I fight hard. But I’m pretty sure it won’t be a horror ride either because you and I love even harder. What I can promise is you’ll always mean more to me than my next breath, and it’ll always be you in my life. No one else.
 - Sometimes bad choices bring us to the right people, Emily.
 - We were written for one another, and I wouldn’t change one line in our romance novel. The good, the bad, the in between. It’s ours. We own it.
 - Doll, you’re going to get me out of your system as much as I’m going to get you out of mine. It’s impossible.
