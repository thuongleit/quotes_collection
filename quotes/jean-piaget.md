 - Intelligence is what you use when you don’t know what to do.
 - Play is the work of childhood.
 - What we see changes what we know. What we know changes what we see.
 - Every time we teach a child something, we keep him from inventing it himself. On the other hand, that which we allow him to discover for himself will remain with him visible for the rest of his life.
 - Experience precedes understanding.
 - Children require long, uniterrupted periods of play and exploration.
 - When you teach a child something you take away forever his chance of discovering it for himself.
 - Teaching means creating situations where structures can be discovered.
 - To understand is to invent.
 - Only education is capable of saving our societies from possible collapse, whether violent, or gradual.
 - Play is the answer to how anything new comes about.
 - The principle goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done.
 - Are we forming children who are only capable of learning what is already known? Or should we try to develop creative and innovative minds, capable of discovery from the preschool age on, throughout life?
 - Scientific knowledge is in perpetual evolution; it finds itself changed from one day to the next.
 - Logic and mathematics are nothing but specialised linguistic structures.
 - Children have real understanding only of that which they invent themselves, and each time that we try to teach them too quickly, we keep them from reinventing it themselves.
 - I could not think without writing.
 - How much more precious is a little humanity than all the rules in the world.
 - Equilibrium is the profoundest tendency of all human activity.
 - Each time one prematurely teaches a child something he could have discovered himself, that child is kept from inventing it and consequently from understanding it completely.
 - Moral autonomy appears when the mind regards as necessary an ideal that is independent of all external pressures.
 - It is with children that we have the best chance of studying the development of logical knowledge, mathematical knowledge, physical knowledge, and so forth.
 - Every acquisition of accommodation becomes material for assimilation, but assimilation always resists new accommodations.
 - The more we try to improve our schools, the heavier the teaching task becomes; and the better our teaching methods the more difficult they are to apply.
 - This means that no single logic is strong enough to support the total construction of human knowledge.
 - As far as the game of marbles is concerned, there is therefore no contradiction between the egocentric practice of games and the mystical respect entertained for rules. This respect is the mark of a mentality fashioned, not by free cooperation between equals, but by adult constraint.
 - Punishment renders autonomy of conscience impossible.
 - Scientific thought, then, is not momentary; it is not a static instance; it is a process.
 - What the genetic epistemology proposes is discovering the roots of the different varieties of knowledge, since its elementary forms, following to the next levels, including also the scientific knowledge.
 - During the earliest stages of thought, accommodation remains on the surface of physical as well as social experience.
 - The essential functions of the mind consist in understanding and in inventing, in other words, in building up structures by structuring reality.
 - Our problem, from the point of view of psychology and from the point of view of genetic epistemology, is to explain how the transition is made from a lower level of knowledge to a level that is judged to be higher.
 - To express the same idea in still another way, I think that human knowledge is essentially active.
 - The self thus becomes aware of itself, at least in its practical action, and discovers itself as a cause among other causes and as an object subject to the same laws as other objects.
 - If mutual respect does derive from unilateral respect, it does so by opposition.
 - I am convinced that there is no sort of boundary between the living and the mental or between the biological and the psychological. From the moment an organism takes account of a previous experience and adapts to a new situation, that very much resembles psychology.
 - Knowing reality means constructing systems of transformations that correspond, more or less adequately, to reality.
 - In genetic epistemology, as in developmental psychology, too, there is never an absolute beginning.
 - What is desired is that the teacher ceased being a lecturer, satisfied with transmitting ready-made solutions. His role should rather be that of a mentor stimulating initiative and research.
 - I have always detested any departure from reality, an attitude which I relate to my mother’s poor mental health.
 - True interest appears when the self identifies itself with ideas or objects, when it finds in them a means of expression and they become a necessary form of fuel for its activity.
 - In other words, knowledge of the external world begins with an immediate utilisation of things, whereas knowledge of self is stopped by this purely practical and utilitarian contact.
 - Accommodation of mental structures to reality implies the existence of assimilatory schemata apart from which any structure would be impossible.
 - If logic itself is created rather than being inborn, it follows that the first task of education is to form reasoning.
 - Logical positivists have never taken psychology into account in their epistemology, but they affirm that logical beings and mathematical beings are nothing but linguistic structures.
 - The child who defines a lie as being a “naughty word” knows perfectly well that lying consists in not speaking the truth. He is not, therefore, mistaking one thing for another, he is simply identifying them one with another by what seems to us a quaint extension of the word “lie”.
 - The most developed science remains a continual becoming.
 - During the earliest stages the child perceives things like a solipsist who is unaware of himself as subject and is familiar only with his own actions.
 - The current state of knowledge is a moment in history, changing just as rapidly as the state of knowledge in the past has ever changed and, in many instances, more rapidly.
 - As you know, Bergson pointed out that there is no such thing as disorder but rather two sorts of order, geometric and living.
 - The more the schemata are differentiated, the smaller the gap between the new and the familiar becomes, so that novelty, instead of constituting an annoyance avoided by the subject, becomes a problem and invites searching.
 - Reflective abstraction, however, is based not on individual actions but on coordinated actions.
 - We learn more when we are compelled to invent.
 - The child is a realist in every domain of thought, and it is therefore natural that in the moral sphere he should lay more stress on the external, tangible element than on the hidden motive.
