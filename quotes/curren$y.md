 - No square shall enter in the circle of winners.
 - I don’t split poles. When I’m walking with my friends by lampposts, we all walk on the same side. And I won’t cross over your legs. If you’re sitting down and like chilling on the floor, I won’t walk over your legs because then you’ll go to jail.
 - If I showed you where I live, you would think that I was hiding.
 - Once you got three records, you pretty much got 10.
