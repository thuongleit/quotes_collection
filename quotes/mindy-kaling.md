 - My mom always used to say, “You can’t say I love you before you can say I.” And I think that sort of makes sense.
 - I would say that my mother is the single biggest role model in my life, but that term doesn’t seem to encompass enough when I use it about her. She was the love of my life.
 - Running is a quick trigger for a good mood. The great thing about endorphins, you don’t have to be in great shape to get them.

 - I have a personality defect where I REFUSE to see myself as an underdog.
 - There are little Indian girls out there who look up to me, and I never want to belittle the honor of being an inspiration to them. But while I’m talking about why I’m so different, white male show runners get to talk about their art.

 - You should know I disagree with a lot of traditional advice. For instance, they say the best revenge is living well. I say it’s acid in the face – who will love them now?

 - People talk about mumblecore but I prefer bumblecore, hyper-realistic bee movies about how bees really are.

 - I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which the world operates according to different rules than my regular human world.

 - I always knew I wanted kids, but when my mom passed away I was like, ‘I want a bunch of kids. I want three kids or four kids, and I want to have that relationship again.’ I can’t bring my mom back, but I can have children.
 - To put it kindly, I am a very talkative, social person. To put it less kindly, I’m a flibbertigibbet, which is what my frenemy Rainn Wilson calls me.

 - Anyone who’s lost someone to cancer will say this, that you have to struggle to try to remember the person before the diagnosis happened, because they really do change – as anyone would change.
 - I’m not good at anything except writing jokes. I wasn’t good at sports, I wasn’t good at anything artsy, ever. I think there was a real worry for a while about what I would be good at. I was just this chubby little Indian kid who looked like a nerd.
 - People take things at face value on social media. Earnestness is the assumption.
 - I’m not overweight. I flucuate between chubby and curvy.

 - I want a schedule-keeping, waking-up-early, wallet-carrying, picture-hanging man. I don’t care if he takes prescription drugs for cholesterol or hair loss.
 - Growing up, I remember my parents feeling a little wary of ‘The Simpsons.’ This was the late eighties, and there was a wave of articles about TV shows that were bad for America. Then we all started watching it and loved it.
 - The Tweets that I have written that are most popular are the ones that are the kind of universal girly concerns and observations.
 - Albums that remind me of my childhood happiness make me incredibly sad now.
 - Anybody can have a birthday. It requires nothing. Murderers have birthdays. It’s the opposite of anything that I believe in. And I don’t like at work where you stop everything to sing ‘Happy Birthday’ to someone. I feel like that’s for children.
 - I was obsessed with being popular in high school and never achieved it. There’s photos from our high school musicals, and I’m comically in the deep background, wearing a beggar’s costume.
 - My parents were supportive of my creativity but did not have a lot of patience for whimsy with zero production value. They had stuff to do.

 - Your fear that your parents will actually kill you for dropping out of college is something that I think a lot of children of immigrants would maybe relate to.
 - So I’m into men now, even though they can be frightening. I want a schedule-keeping, waking-up-early, wallet-carrying, non-Velcro-shoe-wearing man.

 - I’m Adorable. I Look like Keira Knightley Running Errands!
 - All I want to do is be a gay icon. I was reading Lady Gaga’s twitter, because she has like 12 million followers, or something like that. I feel like she has fans, gay, straight, bi, who would throw themselves off a building for her.
 - I am a super-confident writer, and as a joke writer and as an actress, I’m like, ‘I want to go head-to-head with every person.’ I am an Indian woman and I’m a kind of double minority in this world.
 - I know a lot of people think of me and they like, oh that girl is really sexy, that girl is really put together, she would never do something as unladylike as a beet eating competition.
 - In terms of my Indianness, I try not to rely on it nor deny it. When it comes up organically in my writing, we can address it. About five years ago, we wrote this episode of ‘The Office,’ called ‘Diwali,’ which seemed like an organic way of using it.

 - I’m giving a lot of opinions, but I don’t give any advice. I’m 31 and I’m not married and having kids. I’m five-foot-three. I weigh, like, 150 pounds and I’m not in this position to be telling people how to live.
 - I am always surprised at what movie studios think people will want to see. I’m even more surprised at how often they are correct.
 - It’d be great to be so famous that if I murder someone, I will never, ever, ever serve any jail time, even if it’s totally obvious to everyone that I did it.
 - I was kind of unfriendly and suspicious of everyone around me. I didn’t talk until I was about 15. It’s a kind of famous story at my house.

 - Every actor pretends that they hate sex scenes, and the truth is that they all love them, and they’re lying.
 - I was just this chubby little Indian kid who looked like a nerd. I didn’t have a ton of academic skills. It wasn’t until I was in high school that I was like, “I guess I like writing dialogue.” So that’s how I got into it.
 - Future hipsters will love me ironically.
 - Everyone has a moment when they discover they love Amy Poehler.
 - People don’t want to listen to a celebrity tweeting about their charities and shows. That’s why comedy writers do well – we put out little funny ideas.
 - Couples are really funny, because if they are together, they can fight and do fun things together. In Jane Austen books, marriage is the end of the story, but I actually think a really funny couple could be a fun thing to watch.
 - Also, chubby people can never truly pull off ethereal the same way skinny people can never be jolly.
 - For heaven’s sake, if you don’t know someone’s name, just pretend you do. Do that thing everyone else does, where you vaguely say, “Nice to see you!” and make weak eye contact.

 - Bribes and boy bands. That’s all you need to be a babysitter.
 - People who are good at stand-up, they sort of seem to have to do it. Something within them makes them have to go on the road.
 - I had to learn a skill set. I think I had the materials to be a good comedy writer.

 - I initially thought you were ugly, but then you walked closer to me and I realized you were pretty.
 - I worship makeup. The basics are always: Stila shadows, LeClerc powder for my crazy shiny skin, Bobbie brown liner pot, Chanel mascara, and Koh Gen Do for foundation, Nars for colors and sparkles.
 - Fast food is hugely important in the life of a comedy writer. All we do is order in, and what we’re going to eat is hotly debated.
 - I’m not married, I frequently use my debit card to buy things that cost less than three dollars, and my bedroom is so untidy it looks like vandals ransacked the Anthropologie sale section. I’m kind of a mess.

 - Always Wear Flats and Have Your Friends Sleep Over: A Step-by-Step How-To Guide for Avoiding Getting Murdered.
 - I think a lot of people compare female writers or female comedians to each other in a way that men are not. Male comedy writers are not scrutinized.
 - Writing a book is the most terrifying thing that I’ve ever done. It’s so much harder than writing for television because it is a completely different skill set.

 - What? I have a cold. Don’t get a look of terror on your face. The worst that could happen is that you’ll get a cold, too. You don’t have to theatrically Purell a thousand times a day and look all panicky every time I come into the room.
 - My dad is a very snappy dresser; he gets all his stuff tailored. He’s an architect, so he’s a little more artistically minded.
 - When smart people are nice, it’s always terrifying, because I know they’re taking in everything and thinking all kinds of smart and potentially judgmental things.
 - I think a lot of writers, male and female, write as if their parents were killed in a car accident when they were 2, and they have no one to hold accountable. And unfortunately, I don’t have that. I have parents who I care about what they think.
 - I don’t want to be skinny. I’m constantly in a state of self-improvement, but I don’t beat myself up over it.
 - Colored leather is my favorite. To me, there’s nothing more fun than wearing a cobalt blue leather skirt or a fuchsia leather jacket.
