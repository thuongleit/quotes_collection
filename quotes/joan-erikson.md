 - Wisdom is not what comes from reading great books. When it comes to understanding life, experiential learning is the only worthwhile kind, everything else is hearsay.
 - No matter how hard you dance, not everyone will clap.
 - A good life is like a weaving. Energy is created in the tension. The struggle, the pull and tug are everything.
 - Vital lives are about action. You can’t feel warmth unless you create it, can’t feel delight until you play, can’t know serendipity unless you risk.
 - Lots of old people don’t become wise, but you don’t get wise unless you age.
