 - I don’t like the discussions about whether photography is an art. Even though I think that if it would be just a craft I would not have stayed with it all my life.
 - I believe a lot in instinct. One should never dull it by wanting to know everything. One shouldn’t ask too many questions but do what one does properly, never rush, and never torment oneself.
 - I believe that photography loves banal objects, and I love the life of objects.
 - I love the life of objects. When the children go to bed, the objects come to life. I like to tell stories about the life of inanimate objects.
