 - Prepare for war, since you have been unable to endure a peace.
 - Go, therefore, to meet the foe with two objects before you, either victory or death. For men animated by such a spirit must always overcome their adversaries, since they go into battle ready to throw away their lives.
 - Iâ€™m never less at leisure than when at leisure, or less alone than when alone.
