 - No, I think most astronauts recognize that the space shuttle program is very high-risk, and are prepared for accidents.

 - It takes a couple of years just to get the background and knowledge that you need before you can go into detailed training for your mission.
 - I’ve discovered that half the people would love to go into space and there’s no need to explain it to them. The other half can’t understand and I couldn’t explain it to them. If someone doesn’t know why, I can’t explain it.
 - It’s easy to sleep floating around – it’s very comfortable. But you have to be careful that you don’t float into somebody or something!

 - The rockets light! The shuttle leaps off the launch pad in a cloud of steam and a trail of fire.

 - So I saw many planets, and they looked just a little bit brighter than they do from Earth.

 - You know, I go around the country a lot.
