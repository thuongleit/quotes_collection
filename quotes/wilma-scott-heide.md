 - I do not refer to myself as a ‘housewife’ for the reason that I did not marry a house.
 - The hand that rocks the cradle should also rock the boat.
 - The pedestal is immobilizing and subtly insulting whether or not some women yet realize it. We must move up from the pedestal.
 - We will no longer be led only by that half of the population whose socialization, through toys, games, values and expectations, sanctions violence as the final assertion of manhood, synonymous with nationhood.
